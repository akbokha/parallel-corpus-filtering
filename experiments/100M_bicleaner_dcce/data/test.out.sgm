<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer visited with some colleagues a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their celebrations, they drove home to the feed-troughs in a fast gallop.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And so the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer was - 101 tournament wins - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let his family run over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even swear to photographs.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen and therewith also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German Sports Aid handed the man from Schaffhausen within the framework of a small gala the Golden Athleen Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards to the likeable athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Federal Cross of Merit, silver bay leaf, Champions Tour Player of the Year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the Queen of Britain has already rebuked him.</seg>

<seg id="21">For decades, Langer has promoted offspring.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade deal - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two U.S. Presidential candidates are undivided in tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton constitute a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to control the economy to death and to regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively reverse the regulations and he will be strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says, "The state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has opportunities to open to disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich would be increased, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "in that need to be invested, pump and Clinton say almost immediately." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate is even announcing the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state-critical budget of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could still be internal discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">Significant are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, it wants to cancel the Paris climate protection agreement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton, on the other hand, intends to expand and demand renewables with its investment programme:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both TPP, the transpazied trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both, however, do not want to isolate the United States from international trade - but simply only to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "they should then be paid better," "" "says Clinton." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump does want to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage has to come up, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand Trump is standing, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics believe that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton stands at least asking the rich to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house provides refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are four women sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby at most a year old.</seg>

<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are refugees.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in Munich north in one of the few decentralized accommodations for single-fledged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs set up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">She has been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who think that when they anchor in Germany, Bahr recalls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee camps would often be deemed to be inferior and abused in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="32">This means that about 90 per cent of women living in the north-east of Munich are traumatized.</seg>

<seg id="36">Since they often don't know how to help, there are more accommodations for them, says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria the seven District Governments are responsible for the housing of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their area of jurisdiction, some answer with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">There is no such thing in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia.</seg>
<seg id="40">Also in Swabia, fledged women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to hand over their hands and announced an official end to the eight-month war of the words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes receipt of his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I can't resist the impression that Ankara would most want this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed to be dirty and he barely radiated heat, even for his retaining relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day a newspaper described that Erdogan could have behaved like never anything bad happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's emitting, sustainable boldness showed that Russia's head of state had not forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the firing of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was rage-blazing.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and accused Ankara of having fallen back on Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offense was even greater as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building up the vetofore will be difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media made a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The serious accusations of senior officials were that Erdogan's own family benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria's areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting was held only because Putin received the excuse that he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he was relieved of his office in a failed coup d "état in the last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemsti formulates it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious at the West as its response to the attempted takeover of power considered a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "in addition, the continued anger on the snail empires of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won in Ankara with security a bonus that he called for support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace by the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to represent an "Alliance of outsiders," as an analyst once described to me: two countries that violate themselves from the West and are badly treated and now unite.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, in spite of the public atonement, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents spoke at the press conference that they hadn't even touched the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey intentionally refrained from answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey swept the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="2">Dettori sprays champagne after a double with Newmarket, bringing him 3,000th win</seg>
<seg id="3">Jockey Frankie Dettori assured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">He set a milestone on Predilection, trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey who reached the milestone in the flat race.</seg>
<seg id="6">He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.</seg>
<seg id="7">The three-time winner Dettori, who in front of Ghayyar won, said: "it's something special."</seg>
<seg id="8">I am very emotional because my family is also here</seg>
<seg id="9">I am very happy that it happened in Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a mundane Friday evening with 20,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I am relieved and very modest.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dettori takes up the cheer when he wins the victory on Predilection</seg>
<seg id="13">Two jockeys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record breaking career.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lester Piggott, the nine-time derbysieger had 4,493 career steps</seg>
<seg id="15">Frankie is one of the best jockey of Modernism and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone, which only few reached before him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma fans thrilled fans for years for this sport.</seg>
<seg id="18">I said Frankie some weeks ago at Epsom, that he had already collected 6.000 wins if he wasn't just a weekend and grandstand jockey!</seg>
<seg id="19">Frankie has already made nearly 30 years of winners in the UK, which is great.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has a vibrant personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount</seg>
<seg id="22">From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was nerve wrecking.</seg>
<seg id="24">A whole series of major tournaments, including his famous "Glorous Seven" in 1996 at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and got a ban on drugs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian President Sergei Ivanov's Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was part of the strictest confidence-circle of Putin for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old has been appointed special representative for environmental and transport affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a statement by the Kremlin, it is stated that without stating grounds, Putin has ordered the dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been his deputy since 2012, was named his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in Tallinn, Estonia in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin website, it is said (in Russian) that he later was the chief of the government and Chief of Staff of the Government College.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the government's main task to support your work as Head of State on bills and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidant and worked as he was for the Soviet Intelligence Service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men asserted that the Chief of Staff will come back at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion that a man who once was praised as a potential president once again would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - to entrust my posts for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was President of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term of Putin would have violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became the President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four sealings of the" "" "ceiling fan" "" "approaching the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slanted ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensland crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all the witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is given a concrete fire for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of the trendsetting and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the north, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the north side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massively because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be dragged upwards at an incline of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because the tolerances on which the team were working were tiny - on each side they were just a few millimetres.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "the SPD and Greens mean: investors should be put much stronger in their duty in the future." ""</seg>

<seg id="6">First of all, the question is: who should build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">So far there is no provision.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said S & D Group president Christopher Bratmann:" "" "we agree with the Greens: if you want to build on urban areas, in future, 20 percent of all apartments must be classified as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments can, however, also arise in the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "however, the major point of contention in the town hall is," "" "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors on such areas to build at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of homes as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "the problem, says Bratman," "" "There is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make investors as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants to impose tougher constraints on investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, as Bratstmann, there is a tightening of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear whether we will get skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you reconcile the loss of more around 1300 inexpensive dwellings, whose funding will expire in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be purchased from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought to get apartments back into price binding.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the Weststadt.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">For in the Weststadt, Fristen is running at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 flats can be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: these are the owners, the housing companies do not want.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the Weststadt is drastically increased again, it is removed from the goal of the so-called mixing.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no concentration of socially disadvantaged in just a few districts.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside, but rather prefer spending their free time on screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to TV, then video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created initially for video games in the 1990s (later arose a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was offset by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons, which are tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "photographed" (using a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the delusion and jumped for the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that reflect the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, who tracked 35,000 users, announced the Washington Post recently that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of follow-up people, who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it merely sees raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">A lot of public health awareness campaigns that people want to "take 30 minutes time" to "come down from the sofa" and "being active every day," stumbled on deaf ears because many public messages are boring and come from people who look elly.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who do sports regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the miracle of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoor that is fun for them.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friendships at the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are grumpy playing spoils that always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sport as this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games, combining apps and virtual reality with the assets in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, more active and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all this.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">On a whole line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast made a multi-campaign title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her total score of 62,198 was clearly before the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team winner Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medallist Aliya Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles turmocks on the hanging bar during the solo multi-fight event of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American, who wins a multi-battle title, and in total the fifth while holding her call to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought her sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years of her sport, 15 World Championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a blend of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rescue from her said that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It was expecting a final test in Brazil, a competition which was not so much between the balance and the rest of the athletes, but rather between it and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be regarded as disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi-battle array of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as exclamation mark at the farewell party of retired Co-ordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted, during its long path to the top, never planned the future, it is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of her floor exercises - which contain her typical Tumbling pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boormans mother during a school excursion to the gymnasium, was trained in the Boorman.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has not lost a multi-campground competition, a winning streak that will hold as long as Biles wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafa was easy through two turns, the picture was deceptive.</seg>
<seg id="27">Floating beams and ground tubes - in which Biles holds the world title - lauded.</seg>
<seg id="28">She recovered again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and sitting on the ground with a 15,933 on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman hugged her softly when she awaited her grandstand - a pure form - and tears poured on Biles shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team captain, called Oma by the Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her cultivation, she cast out kisses to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, sometimes doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly spreading Tweet of the 19-year-olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12 year old girl were shot, who died in one of the most lethal attacks for a decade in the first mass murder of Phoenix, while they stopped in the car and listened to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12th, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots out of a hand-made firearm while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle, is read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police said that the triple murder does not seem to have been the result of a robbery affair, as the aggressor did not carry the handbags or the $2,900 that were owned by one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting caused the investigators to take a closer look at whether they are connected to four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In total, seven people were killed in hispanic residential areas within four months and two were injured.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it happens in a residential area in front of a house," shared Howard the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is believed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissant from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investigators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized because of her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died on site.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which resulted in an empty pick-up truck half an hour before the triple murder and from which it was assumed that it was the work of serial killer.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators found cartridge shells and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment.</seg>

<seg id="19">Microcephalia has a myriad of causes: genetic like with Edmund and infections with viruses such as measles or the Zikavirus during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="20">The symptoms and prognoses can vary greatly.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the Zikavirus infected.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine under the Women's Olympics in the gymnastics and that is more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnastics, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who worked for many young girls from other complexion.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, who is catholic, makes everybody proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one under the female gymnasium was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gyms routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we do not look at the gymnastics classes all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics are a costlier sport and gymnasts are first and foremost in private sports clubs which are maintained by parents who pay for training, accommodation, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnasiums are located in wealthy suburbs, which can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the gymnasts receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to provide the communities with innumerable young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, providing a more affordable and accessible gymnastics training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastics foundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban teens (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer high-quality gymnastics that make the possibility of learning and benefiting from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turunen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits to health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to care for the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine presentation of "Girl Power" by the Holen des olympic team golds and thank you that you are motivating so many young girls with different backgrounds to get their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute on the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants who voted in favour rejected him.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July Hunt had revealed plans to introduce the treaty and said that the NHS was in a "niemandsland" and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistance personnel should receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend trips to improve maintenance during normal times.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistance Dogs, announced last night in a communication: "assistance specialists have still raised serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat up the current crisis and it will be given to treat all doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and the time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes with the government to engage in conflict with the government and sometimes on deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was done by a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made over the last month that his door would always be open.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "Jeremy Hunt has to act now to raise awareness and address the concerns of the assistance personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "if he does not do this, the doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work campaigns." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were included to cover doctors on the strike chain cover.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute on the changes by adopting the reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA wants a better week of the week for the 54.000 assistance physicians who are subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS employees, asked the assistant doctors to stop the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "Mortimer said:" "" "labor combat measures reach nothing of a little, but have already polluted teams and service providers and are worried only of care, distress and disruption to patients, caregivers and their families." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">Over the past two months, we talked to the Committee of Assistance Dogs and responded positively to the concerns about guardianship and whistlebings with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.</seg>
<seg id="17">Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as despatch, flexibility in training, additional training for those who return from a vocational training, training comfort, mutual recognition of curriculum, training holidays and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how seriously it was the employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health related to the observance of the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty materials in the artery walls that form plaque.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the covering breaks apart, it can cause a blood clots, which conjures blood flow to the heart and thereby causes a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clots triggers, it can flow through the blood stream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">Persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft of NICE, published today, recommends a 12 month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Care Evaluation Center, said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows that in combination with aspirin, Ticagrelor is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Through a preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. the draft proposal does not recommend any treatment that goes beyond this period.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on the release of a government report for corruption</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political correctness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud is ignorantly ignored in Muslim communities like a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "former cabinet member Sir Eric Piles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town halls to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to" "" "oversensitivity to ethno and religion" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should prove their identity in order to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, a voter only has to call his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes to write non-removable ink on a person's finger if they release their vote to prevent someone selects twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>

<seg id="12">The report was ordered from Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets Wahlscandals in the East of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special court ruled that the incumbent mayor Luton Rahman was to be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "Rahman is said to have" "" "led his campaign on the basis of the relatious duty of Muslims to choose him" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He was particularly worrying about the fraudulent postal code - with the older members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the guiding of ID cards to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In its report it reads: "as evidence has been attached to pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people to choose according to the will of the elders, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller descended his immune system and wholeheartedly a serious test by leaking up some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk switched his train to a euro note, a handrail at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a train toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before checking out each object he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to do.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of replacing the rinsing button of a draw toilet, which has been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen flush.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the support of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily nothing left what he leaked off, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resistance of his bowel by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations to washing knobs of toilets, the task assigned its immune system definitively under a test</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said:" "" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he justified his call in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial period showed a luminance of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the luminance count of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to refuse, after their luminance number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "that comes close to the worst thing I've smelled in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more impure than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here because it is disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company is equipping Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer something new to the consumers.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at while at the same time explaining the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We carried out crazy brainstorming sessions that ended that we said "Let's call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health will become a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Tom Hakala, who led the film, added:" "" "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet, which is shown in the film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to check them out and others, where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we've recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio from 2015, 84 percent of respondents associate lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left her social apartment after a deletion with a loss of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Treviscock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing association found the property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had gaping holes, wooden planks were torn, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family were resettled and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for home administration at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think that people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider, since this property is thought to be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment meanwhile and the police said that the terror that the family had added, street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, quarrels and curses included.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name stood on the lease, got an arrangement for antisocial behavior in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under certain circumstances, old trash was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden planks were torn down</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors told us they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delved them and their partner violently from the property this week after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delooning was cheered by lightened neighbours who said their lives were made hell.</seg>

<seg id="23">Now that they are finally gone, it will be beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Managers of Cornwall Housing, said it would have given the family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">Rubbish and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the Municipal House.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the tenant detainees to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family because delooning is always the final step that considers Cornwall Housing." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their deeds had to be awful for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and members of the community who have courageously approached us and have provided us with the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.</seg>

<seg id="12">The Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them.</seg>
<seg id="13">The speaker said that due to the poor visibility of the area, the jet flew slightly deeper than usual, but the air forces persisted that safety at no time was at risk.</seg>
<seg id="14">Surface fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland these summers, where also four people on Madeira Island came to death.</seg>

<seg id="2">The IOC intends to set up a disciplinary commission.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kenya's athletes are facing accidents after the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a fraud test in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee decided to promptly set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan functionary told us that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, in the Olympic village gave a urine sample under the name of the 800-metre-runner Ferguson Rotich.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF world association asked the IOC about the case to exert its own investigations, shared an IAAF speaker.</seg>
<seg id="9">"depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," said it in an IAAF explanation.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "he (Anzrah) has gone to the doping control station and has signed up and signed up as Ferguson Rotich," "" "explained Kenias chief de Mission Stephan Arap Soi." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athletes, who stood on the list for training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Rotich had become World Cup fourth in 2015 over 800 meters.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days earlier, the Kenyan athletics delegation, Michael Rotich, had been withdrawn from Rio games.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is said to have informed athletes of his country about pending doping tests.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to media reports, he was said to have been arrested at Nairobi's airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">Kenya has been under special monitoring for a long time at the IOC after numerous doping agreements.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the announcement of the more than 2000 doping target controls submitted by the IOC in front of the Rio Olympics, it was previously noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">Before the summer games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a consequence, the WADA Kenya took from the list of countries whose doping control conforms with the rules of WADA.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kenya is regarded as a big runner-nation.</seg>
<seg id="22">Athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of television reports of the ARD, accusations have always been raised that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable mentality of sport fraud.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, IOC member Richard Pound called for a similar investigation into Kenya, as he had recruited them in Russian athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">Thereby it was possible to demonstrate that in this type of sport was comprehensively and systematically subdued.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get anything from the summer campaign - and the holiday makers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the land tag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the Parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For more stupidly than hitherto it is not possible: summer holidays, heat and day-to-day elections - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the election militants, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">The most tourists who are in the country, on the island of Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not residents, so do not choose the land tag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems for this: helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, spread flyers and enumerate voices in the end can only be laborious.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, the election and final day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania must once again let the people pass their election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can tell it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is exciting how much newbie AfD cuts off and what remains in the end coalitionμ.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sella, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous electoral campaign, one sees from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the land, distributes roses and chatting a bit with the people, just as his legendary wormson predecessor Harald Ringstorff also did.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "her refugee policy, her" "" "We are creating" "" "has hastened the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its peak channel data, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make the right place at the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations twice; Merkel parliament is in the north-east.</seg>

<seg id="27">The Council of the CDU Elector Cocoon to his comrades is also self-exposing: "you must go where it hurts, namely where people are: Dorffeste, Golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because a lot is on the game, Sellering has now called his SPD into a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Socialists and Democrats recently stood behind partners CDU (25) and just shortly before the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2011 the SPD won a clear victory at 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>

<seg id="1">B27 remodeling: restaurants suffer from blockage</seg>
<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 a.m. and end only at 8pm, there are all praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they did everything pretty shaky," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no default.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October.</seg>
<seg id="8">The addition of the responsible persons responsible for the construction works is also commended, for instance when it comes to the furnishing of homes.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was sandered on Monday to the south and also the blocking of the Aspergstrasse in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus also the connection to Rottenburg exists, the traffic situation within the place has been relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from the B 27 from Ofterdingen on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The credential traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there have been some considerable discomfort," says the deputy head manager Florian King, responsible for the restauration of the rehabilitation management.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachelstrasse, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping routes were looking for and rather familiar to their navigation system than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks occupy themselves in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality exacerbated the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable transgressions," says King, who made himself aware of the situation himself.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have already been flashed.</seg>
<seg id="18">The quickest was on the way at 77 hours per hour in the Tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the street is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Businessmen don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 redevelopment has led to breakthroughs with them leaves everyone one asks to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have less to do with the end customer, i.e. for other companies, have hardly any consequences for them.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "Thomas Sulz also speaks of a" "" "at most light drop" "", "but also admits that" "" "the running news is missing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the locals along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">Albert Göhner, Owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crowned, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential threat.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all the restaurants have "hit hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>

<seg id="34">He had to release half of his employees.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, the restaurant benefits from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages that arise through the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where so much more generously handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all cases, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been here since 1715, pointing to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regular guests are less frequently passing by due to the complicated traffic guidance, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it is also somewhere else beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his stem cell returns to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the biggest crisis that its restaurant experienced in its long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, this is brutal.</seg>

<seg id="11">After the recent attacks in Wuerzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière had a little time to pass before he presented his conclusions for security in the republic.</seg>

<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security agencies is also not surprising.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "" "" "these will be difficult points for the SPD," "" "admits the CDU." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">He still believes this to be reasonable and I don't demand anything that doesn't have a chance with the coalitionist anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas are presented to de Maizière as well.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them have in common: he plans quick methods for deportations and more opportunities to detain people from deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees targeting the country must first let their smartphones lick and reveal social media accounts for a security audit.</seg>
<seg id="22">In case of divorce for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than up to now - such as committing crimes or deliberately throwing their papers away to disguise their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of these are political and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of them are still intreated and leave questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in the unequal treatment of patients, for example, the question arises: what does this actually have to do with safety and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the attacks of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, in view of the high number of refugees, many people were worried about security.</seg>

<seg id="6">Despite its many brands and some well-running markets, Europe's largest automobile industry continues to boast a plus in spite of its many brands and some well-running markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in July, the VW brand was weaker mainly in Western Europe and thus heavily polluted the total sales, as announced by the company in Dax.</seg>
<seg id="8">In July, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year with 449100 cars.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sales in Western Europe, the second most important market in China alone, were 14 percent lower than the previous year's month.</seg>
<seg id="10">Shipments fell by almost a sixth in the German home market.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brand sales leader Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July, above all, to two sales days less in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, there has been a purchase restraint in some core markets through "changing economic conditions."</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote for exiting from the EU explained a spokeswoman.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the USA, where the exhaust fumes have escalated first, a minus is also available.</seg>
<seg id="15">Great support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">All in all, the primarily affected home brand of Lower Saxony is much more gliding due to the diesel scandal: after the first seven months there is only an extradition of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="17">From January to July, group sales head Fred Kappler continued to present a sales station.</seg>
<seg id="18">Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time, 5,904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had been tampered with with a software exhaust.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW invokes about 2.5 million wagons for retrofitting into the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of the retrofitting, VW confirmed that the conversion of cars has no negative effects.</seg>

<seg id="25">"" "the" "" "Focus" "" "had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for retrofitted diesel models." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to comment, this statement derives from current data under the pseudonym of non-avenue male mediators with harsh insults.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Yougv, the multiple reemergence of records is not based on a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but on midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older drinkers retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of Yougv agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and stuffed wild before I stop, hold my hands and say something like: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now completing the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to judge their age and minds through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I of Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (number of data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 slabs.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records which he could not afford than they appeared and to buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70 that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and would like to spend time alone, and add: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers whom he meets can apply to Yougv profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">But he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and get to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have conducted, people tend to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of followers of the record revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica, to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to the WEZ some of the older customers were assaulting the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound boards, from objects that awaken happy memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it may be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">That's for me as a collector, and I think it's so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally concern yourself.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee whispers from a stack of labels." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard of it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried while I smooed through a pile of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of people: three middle-aged men), has noticed a revival aspect of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone came here only recently and said:" "" "I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead LP so that I can put it on the shelf" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less music-class.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the records almost a whole floor, has a colorful audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesize and sexipacked pop instead of experimental jazz is from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strangely lonely, but naïve mental trauma is hard to imagine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around in the shop for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It makes more window shopping than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is... "she drives away with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record enthusiasts: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">As I give the appearance of mustering his jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a crosley teammate.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send in the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research shows that the results of Yougv agree, they, at least in record stores in Soho, leave the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety not with bobbling through record stores of Berwick Street and the sheets through disks, while they avoid the starring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter that stands above the shoulders of no suspecting middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected a request by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses in which people within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to beer drinks, sell, barber services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which provide a risk of fire and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also argued that temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the Prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable. "</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafés and restaurants would play a much bigger role than simply feeding people who" "" "live in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the travel was the Jungle Book Kids "Café of the camp, which is operated by the public and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids Café.</seg>

<seg id="13">The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants stated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle has increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new arrivals throughout the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers must adapt to the next generation speed measurer: in different federal states, among others in Hessen and Brandenburg, new lightening devices are being tested, which should be particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic enforcement trailers of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can, for example, be used at accident sites, where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example on motorway construction sites or to rehabilitated bridges with temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limiters there with a stationary glitter.</seg>
<seg id="5">A permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The enforcement carrier is self-sufficient: its battery lasts for five days in case of continuous measurement. the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks with laser measurement technology.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits and drive bans after time, travel strip and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the highly experienced condition, the trailer can be fitted with each car with trailer hitch.</seg>
<seg id="10">To ensure that it is not simply cluttered, it is lowered in the measuring mode, so that the wheels disappear in the armoured and by the way also sweat-proof outer shell.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the glitter from vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since 2015, the trailer has been tested according to information from Vitronic in various federal states and is now also used.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at the 7-er Rugby ended on Thursday evening for an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were hit with a result of 43-7 at the odoro stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji divided a master class in handling, side-stepping, back, line and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was lost due to the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it is probably not that at least a Brite will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, under Ryan, she lost every game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and made the attacks GBs bounce off.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if they were running in driving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau was overcrowded in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With just four minutes playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner he turned.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A strong Tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain from Sierra Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua went a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the reunion and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressed through another weak tacklings of the UK team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">That's how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">UK led basic changes to the half-time and closed the fijivian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the circumstances of the first half, until Joshua Tuisova was going through after a brilliant Interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea sullians, whose fans sang, pivot flags and danced on the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame set the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle shouted, the Fijis hugged and GB collapsed in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half-finalmatch from the race - Great Britain's conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton went through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a score among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside Team, secured the prize - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by battle with the trainer's cancer</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emoteric gold than with these games and that will mean what.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard Hieve, which go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional importance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though it was only the two who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was present when they rowed to the second Olympic-old in the second without a tax-wife, the first women in the history of British Sports who placed such a benchmark.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolute, after all her 39.ter undefeated bet, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletins gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which is not reflected in the style of the triumphal arch.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to incremental progress that make the difference and no one was more practical than the trainer who didn't know about 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and that they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the break to a minimum, if that is the right term at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was hospitalized and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory, their first thoughts of Williams, who had a nerve-wracking morning thus spent a little more than would otherwise talk and thus tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "panning, which was a Captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said," "" "I was an emotional wreck this week. that's a bit extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much I have worked for, how much I and Helen and Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we wouldn't be anybody, so a massive thank you to him. he's the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have asked for a better person for training or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to stop, panning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very trapped in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "Stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to do something good.</seg>
<seg id="33">We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race as we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about their future.</seg>

<seg id="4">A small Frankish drinking water association as a model for large water producers.</seg>
<seg id="5">This was the name of the Bavarian Broadcasting Corporation's contribution some time ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">A little later the water forum of the government of Lower Franconia paid tribute to the purpose association.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "the work of the Veitenstein Group was" "" "exemplary" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this Rupert Göller stands for 28 years as managing director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Veitenstein Group, headquartered in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, annually fosters about 150000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The communes are the municipalities of Kirchberg, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other towns and villages.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Breitbrunn mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed as a water-keeper in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the kennel in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they extend from water management and maintenance work through office and organizational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and supplements up to emergency assignments on weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event she called the start-up and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the renovation of the high containers (1999), the re-purchase of a central computer control (2004) and the renewal of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no standstill and I have always added new things, because water is life-savvy and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudation, she praised Gollers faithful, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has used a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he lived the water-purpose-association properly, as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the Veitenstein Group's success concept for nitrate reduction in front of the Lower Franconia water forum.</seg>
<seg id="20">He received a great deal of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, on his part, praised the Aquarian Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water-keeper and he was a loyal cap.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As climaxes from his point of view he described the well building and the restructuring of the kennel.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment, however, were the rupture at the high reservoir in Kirchberg on a 3rd of January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">You can also maintain the supply of Neubrunn once, because you filled the high container of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the Drinking Water Association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for the German Steel Industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains unaffected by additional costs in millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the sector from green electricity production are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">The German Steel Industry (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition), says Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the German Steel Industry.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>

<seg id="8">Gabriel told WAZ that there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works are an EEG levelling of 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that the status quo of the current regulation is largely written down.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's successful effort for the steel industry is of particular importance.</seg>

<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has suffered under overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation was exacerbated by the world's largest producer of China throwing tons of steel on the world market in the face of the weaker domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has been somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, imported import duties on import steel have effect, on the other hand economic prospects in China have brightened up.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is not clear how sustainable the price overhaul is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would have stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">At the end ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 8,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel producers are cautious.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as Steel Wirtschaftsvereinigung announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May, the quantity produced went back to one another for the second month.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp to her entire life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she occupied the subject of music at the teacher's college, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "singing moves me - emotionally and physically," "" "she describes." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good in her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors, Erhard Hackler says about the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and cultivate social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "speaking and organizing, to be able to leave and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of togetherness." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result, seniors train a deep and controlled respiration.</seg>
<seg id="13">He who regularly challenges his lungs doesn't get out of the bust too quickly in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an ideal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Association of the Senior Citizens Organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure, it explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often watches that singing or listening to songs in older people wakes up many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, people with dementia are unaware of long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, the head also demands special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">To focus simultaneously on one's own voice and to a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially elderly people, who live alone, practice not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition you get through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for something long, I will get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who already hears when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a sensei's choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a churchly choir can contact the church or the church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you do not have access to the Internet, your family, friends or neighbours can ask for help with internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="7">At about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok's capital, Hua Hin exploded two bombs on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Friday morning, two explosives went up again, according to the authorities, another man was killed.</seg>

<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old finished his first race with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>

<seg id="1">As of October 1, 2016, the fees for each cubic metre of wastewater will be 2.10 euros for the new village / Reuth / Welhahl / Welhpole 3.44 euro; for Zulte mountain / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 Euro (previously 2.26 Euro) and for azendorf 3,64 euros (until now 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf the waste water charge will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a sluggish calculation, the sewage price in Azendorf is then at 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when approval of the budget was established by the Council Office Kulmbach, there were undercover for these sewage plants.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the systems cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of October 1, 2016, the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Welhahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zulte berg will have to go deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The increase in fee amounts between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Director of Management Herbert Schmidt presented to the body, a new calculation of fees for sewage treatment facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and overlappings from the previous calculation period can also be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt founded the serious increases in fee with the fact that there were relatively small facilities with a very low waste water intake between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year in all three wastewater facilities.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, due to the low distribution base, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the volume of sewage in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">In spite of its age refurbishment and repair expenses, all three systems will continue to have a considerable extent due to their age.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the plants for world food, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zulte Mountain, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt explained that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the Azendorf waste water plant.</seg>
<seg id="16">For nearly 20 years, the first sewage sludge had to be disposed of at the pump station Welhahl, and after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage sludge had to be disposed of, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to comply with the water regulations in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Schmidt:" "" "these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued maintenance and maintenance costs that must be taken into account in the new calculation period." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still clearly below the current level of the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that at the low sewerage in the three plants, the expenses for the operation and maintenance were "full."</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to Schmidt, the market community has been spared from major maintenance costs in the waste water facilities over the past 20 years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian cartoon</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that already borders the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are unblunted, self-propelled tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All inaccuracies are sent to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the past, Snapchat filters have criticized critics in which they were accused of using the app blackface conveyor or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When it struck a filter this week, which gave them slot eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "jaundice."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked themselves whether these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it had deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of hurtful clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widespread over the photos that the filter was "injurious and barren said unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contrasting Asian caricature and filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the degrading extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats large audience of young people - who in terms of race more diverse than their older counterparts - could rather assume sensitivity to expect.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "when one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is insulting for a user," "" "it is much more difficult for such things to stay unnoticed, when it was the case," "" "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for media, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for media and in a phone interview, she said that racial issues reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu also criticized the big part white, only male leadership and ended their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said Chinesich-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable in order to say something about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left Snapchat unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff and indicates its status as a private company.</seg>

<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command have changed intelligence to draw up an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, when the actual conditions were allowed on site, an investigation committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican Committee of the Force Forces Committee, secret services committees and the military budget committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments on US efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information typically deterred by high-ranking CentCom commanders regularly recorded a positive image of US efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at the Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives, noted.</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistake in the CentCom is sufficient to reach the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed structural problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts exposed the pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements in front of Congress were clearly more positive than the facts."</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom employee publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could start in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, it is so clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command revised the intelligence reports to play down the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information as the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of CentCom reports are underway by the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015 CentCom created a moderately restricted trial for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest level democrat in the Committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process," "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the release of intelligence reports," "" "shamed the moral of analysts and" "" "gave excessively little space for diverging opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that there was no evidence of the intervention of the White House in the CentCom analyst with regard to a "definite political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported a investigation by the Pentagon's General Inspector who was taken up by CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press officer, stated in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on reports of Congress, while investigations by the General Inspector are still under way.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have diverging opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcomed a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have gone beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">The accusations of last year, however, raised the question to what extent President Obama can rely on Central Command for the appraisal of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is remembering disputes of more than ten years ago, when a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush just foresaw a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the revolt against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker, according to government officials, states that contrary to the government's statements, airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This knowledge, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">CentCom's former commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature because of his excessively positive assessment of the situation at a hearing in front of the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced with the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after hitting three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American Women's Field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, there are the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and inescapable, a fast relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the wristband to the swimmers to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with dimples, could certainly have been under these well-known names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting gold at the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, some of which are in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted: pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make modest reasons for my particular favourite, then let me draw your attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the jumping net has already been an olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years have been so sparsely aware that many of them, I had asked, did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian women for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on the trampoline has a certain exterior charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for an unenlightened ear for a clownsSchool that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonist trembling of his never-ending impact - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially combines.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "originates from the Spanish El trampoline, which means" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victors jumping on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "they are assessed according to official Olympic program according to design, degree of difficulty and" "" "flight time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to continue in their quest for gold, faster, up and down, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes down and down, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall, but also another highlight in televised transmission: the World or the Olympic Park.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even touch a spectator at tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel fatiguing myself when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she collides, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly upwards.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 1 pm Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days starting at 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the angathing and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US gymnasts recently suggested - then Mr Dooley expects his air-threatening, new fan community.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia met the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that dozens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police during firing changes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia going to collapse right now?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months protests against the government shook the country and spread out more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government's response was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Videos being circulating about the protests, probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security officers beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the director of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led the government's oppression - the opposition in the country was restricted, while dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or in prison, killed or driven into the deserts of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and don't have other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Tesla, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">All the youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">One generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold on the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a far-reaching election last year, the ruling party and its allies were the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions along the border to Eritrea rise; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who have been defeated more or less in recent years, can use turmoil and be able to arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of drinkly hairs under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first one seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in the last few years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media because cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks the access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies, which hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians stated that they were so protesting against protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons of time, the Amharas, who mainly come from Ethiopia, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that is changing just as well.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are going to coordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in the Amhara and Oromos areas.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray who constitute about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is Meles Zenawi's death.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the Prime Minister until his death on a non-publicized illness in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well-versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special commissions to process enemies and to make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for a relatively obscure reason to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of protests protested, which, according to the information given by analysts, were apparently distracted by the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed even if they were less than in the last months and that time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this has not prevented the intensification of the internal grievance of Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it adopts a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters attacked Gondar, an amharish city, by Tigray and the hatred of the Tigray becomes more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflug over the neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "this," "" "said Mr Abdi," "" "is a very thin tightrope walk." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declares his assertion Obama had founded ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dissipate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeatedly repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were not serious about the "founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions on the communication skills of Republicans's presidential candidates, whether he is able to communicate clearly and intelligible to the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his comrades who strive to take him in protection during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position to declare statements he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump, referring to the claim on Thursday, insisted that he really did not envisage the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he said the accusation was completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump would help to weaken the statement, reminding him that Mr. Obama would destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism harass Mr. Trump, while he tried to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling survey figures on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about business situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Using Twitter, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he drew up strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained "Of course I meant the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his ways to test how certain messages are taken by his fans how they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction falls." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has assumed an even greater note, as its polls have declined further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a leading lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump generally tries to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accused his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But as he emphasises the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal companions in the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent advocates, gave big effort to defend the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I think what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned about Mr. Trumps's statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama IS an almost unknown, small organisation, he called them back-brokers, completely wrong and that's why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being convicted and prejudiced at each of his words.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he defied the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts trying to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats sneered at Mr. Trumps's apology as only proof that he was unfit for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="3">As a gourmets, President Roosevelt had a passion for refined delicacy of Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">Its menu on this day was slightly more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Briman.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "her husband Andrew Coe added," "" "It was also a message to the Americans, how they should eat." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "Coes last book" "" "Chop Suey" "" "was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman told about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "their latest collaboration," "" "A decent meal" "", "which will be published on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they met a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, fast-hearted snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brickman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter grilled hackers, this was the pair for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "rich foods were very popular," "" "said Brickman." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">There were peanut bread, liver cheese and poppy bread.</seg>

<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it must have been lead in the stomach like lead," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before Great Depression the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an All-You-Can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cooked for male ripenes and it was served freshly baked paste for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "" "a Square Meal" "" "records the ways that the country was going to avoid being the land of land." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it was a time when eating for Americans was a central, tense issue," "" "Coe committed why he and his wife wanted to write about it." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The new budget was just as tense: mysterious foods such as breads and casserole were considered staple foods, the casserole as a "wonderful way of reassuring food leftovers," Brickman noted, as chefs were able to hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat that was the centre of American cuisine for years has become a rarely preserved luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Peculiar compounds were tried out because a low calorie and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy cooking.</seg>
<seg id="27">During their research for the book, which also includes recipes, brickman prepared a dish of this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter, too.</seg>

<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the household recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">Like never before, or ever since, domestic economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - addressed the country's eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household women" and the challenge to turn pampas such as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "a Square Meal" "" "is a feast of historic treats." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-Cake food pose.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa peasant kitchen kitchen of his kitchen, he spoke out how the millions-heavy man of the world he became to whom he became.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cooking like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and bore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was terribly realistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor asked him to make an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the hypothesis of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors caused by Mrs Roosevelt suggested that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most desolate. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression, dealing with food, was discarded as soon as the land returned to its legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as how science was applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple had better understood eating habits of brickman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example how they could not throw away food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "she had a real fear of the waste of food," "" "said Coe." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "Brickman remembered:" "" "she really made people ill." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="50">There was no whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>
<seg id="51">Everyone showed a bit of reluctantly a spoon in the viscous, brown Glibber.</seg>
<seg id="52">Amazingly, it tasted not bad.</seg>
<seg id="53">CoE took three times a night.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönland hai: the oldest vertebrae is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland hairs usually only come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats at about 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie only got offspring with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Grönland hai floats on the ground of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1,220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle, characterised by slowness, seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from Copenhagen University and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least a Greenland shark, which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments on this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was true that the evolutionary biologist assumed long that Greenland's hay became stone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are difficult to observe, after all they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear in the winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow-pentine senses them, when they paid six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, researchers found the remains of a seal in the stomach of an animal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may chase sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the polar sea and look for cadaver that tortures from higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now studied 28 Greenland's sharks catching fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest measure was 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, using the carbon-14 method, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is already created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will later no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was therefore supposed to lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons were carrying out larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, the lens nucleus contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons trials in which the third smallest animal had a length of 220 cm. it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, all the larger Greenland-arks had normal carbon-14 quantities in their linsenic nucleus, resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493-centimeter-long Grönlandhai, while the record shark should be 392 years old with 502 centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably at the threshold to sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland's hay with the increase obviously can be at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is not a coincidence that such Methusaleme lives mostly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the record holder, a 211 year old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck put a 120 year old harpoon-tip, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus flames.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they later mature - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal is therefore more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should, on the other hand, invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="3">In 2015, the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; the former Secretary of State Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in Redehonoraren; the former Secretary of State issued an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon & Schuster for her book on her term at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</seg>

<seg id="2">The altar boys from the soul care unit Eyachting Haigerloch St. Anna were on the road on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were completed.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time up to the next pilgrimage route of all the boys in two years, the Ministries of State of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and finally decided for the bishop's city of Freiburg, where a special pilgrimage destination was offered this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the opened door of Mercy on Freiburg Minster.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis from Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and Saints' rooms, went their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, Pastor Storz sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and parted the pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb we drove by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster-Unserer loved woman and so the pilgrimage was started from the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual tours were framed in the morning and evening depending on a short impulse with various prayers, songs and texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way the minis on field crosses, chapels or churches always rushed to sing together a song from a specially compiled pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the nights, the parish offices of the local parishes were available.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage destination, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller made a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and the breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we passed on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The day after that, one stepped up the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but at the same time it had to be lowered by some 500 metres altitude and then climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a common grilling on the badger in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, it went to the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">The minis was visibly relieved and happy later in the afternoon at the Freiburg Minster and crossed the gates of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">God was given thanks to a small impulse.</seg>
<seg id="19">The minis received by the operator Markus Obert were welcomed at the evening mass in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the Breisgaumetropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went by train back to Horb.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scotsman Callum Skinner stormed at home when Brite Gold won gold for cycling</seg>
<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men's team sprint at the Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took up the role of his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy, who made the legend proud when he stormed home to win a victory from favourites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place in London at the World Championship in London despite the withdrawal of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner won an Olympic record in qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hind fell short after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation starting in a higher gear in order to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic Port in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenny's and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the train.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory, this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hindi said:" "" "it feels with the whole UK flags on the grandstand like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We went so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the past five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny, it is in the realm of possible that he repeats Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (a apparently holy date for British sports; on the day were also born Steve Redrage, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same to that of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny is next in the sprint that starts today and will go for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record that won gold in 2012 was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday, he was contested with officials before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on his strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio have been shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">There was drama in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of Sesto and Mobbingerie and the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the legendary name GBs, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melting shop of Portland due to the abolition of the energy demand</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium meltdown of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers "workplaces - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus abolishes all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company hastened.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no other subsidies to be allocated to the operation of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No fewer than 2000 workplaces -direct and indirect - could be at risk with closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects, as the melting process consumes around 10 percent of the entire power generation of Victoria.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa completed the Point Henry Schmelzerei, leading to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting shop of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the long-standing speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, who supplies the large aluminium melting workshop with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, told us that three further owners will terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "AGL expects the plant to continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting process," "" "said the company." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called" "" "hedging transactions" "", "which should have come into effect as of November 2016." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period so they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "therefore, AGL expects the contracts in the financial year 17 to contribute to revenues," "" "said the current supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on the revenue on AGL from the GJ 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "AGL stated that the value of the contracts had already been amortized in its annual slump in the amount of $187 million in" "" "anticipation of a cancellation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said that the decision to book the Treaties, the" "" "Ability Alcoas... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt" "" "is not affected." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have come into force from November this year, even if there is yet another explanation why it has withdrawn from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the poor economic conditions in the industry before the possible closure of Portland Schmelzerei in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the statements by the analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses around 600 megawatts and Tomago to consume around 900 MW of electricity per year.</seg>
<seg id="23">If both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the [electricity market].</seg>
<seg id="24">And it wouldn't be good for us as generating sets, "he said.</seg>

<seg id="6">This represents the clichéed action almost every birthday party of a children's show (Seacre brought the sentence "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Cardashians has begun with certainty.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendal's big sister Kim likes it, as regards the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>

<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she finds herself in good company.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (September 4) and Berlin (September 18) considerable losses are notable for the SPD and CDU government parties.</seg>
<seg id="3">This resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition in the north could scarcely govern, this is not possible according to the survey figures in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">But in both states the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing to head the head of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the SPD dropped from 35.6 percent to 24 percent five years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the survey, the party was only marginally short of the CDU, which could come again to 23 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would come to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country's parliament.</seg>
<seg id="10">Despite slight losses, the Green Party returned to the Schwerin Landtag despite slight losses (previously 8.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="11">The NPD and FDP would not be represented in the parliament with 3 per cent respectively.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the survey, the election of the Berlin Chamber of Deputies only came to 23 percent (election 2011: 28.3 percent).</seg>
<seg id="13">CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">It therefore remained behind the Greens at 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="15">The AfD would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Deputies.</seg>
<seg id="16">With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, while the pirates would not miss the arrival in contrast to 2011.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to projections of a new NASA Climate Model, Venus was probably once habitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that are similar to those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus could once earth-like conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly turned away.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably had more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host lives and protected from fast evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus displays its day-side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which works like a umbrella to shield the surface from most of the sun's heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously thought by planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was supposedly habitable, Venus -- during the course of several billions of years --was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their steam was blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen sandwich only remained a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers to understand why the stars in the star cluster rotate to different rates and in what context the rotation time periods are with the origin of the planet.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Centre in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The constellation of the Pleiades lies 445 lightyears away from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this constellation, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotation rates, these mature stars meet large amounts of starches.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star age, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler attaches the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sunspots.</seg>

<seg id="15">As the constellation of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities like rotational rates.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide erase hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Blackmailing software developers are currently targeting companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by malware protection specialists Malwarebytes at 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once, partially multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, nearly 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators are visibly specializing in attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially leading ransom is significantly higher than in the case of private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarterabyte boss Marcin Kleczynski speaking with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most painters were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">First of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks happened quickly in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware operates after a simple pattern: once on a victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files like Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the receivables of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the end-turn code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryptofeeding Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users use the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">The damage is correspondingly higher if a ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the German companies affected reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt their business operations, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is difficult for managers to reject the perpetrators in view of the downtime in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackmail users and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They tell their victims via chat how they can pay by Bitcoin, set free accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data decrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risk-free gains from the ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware around within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">More likely, however, it is three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The malware kits so far have been created by malware, counseling and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "included is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers are looking for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log in one of the forums in the underground, buy the set of a criminal and instruct another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals employ spammers with spreading," Wisniewski explains.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now well-known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to repel ransomware by file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already following new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption is no longer a sufficient threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing models," "" "explains Malwarterabyte boss Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">The potential for damage, depending on the type of data, is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators will also be able to achieve completely new targets on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">Security researchers demonstrated at the Defcon chipper conference, how they could get a thermostat connected to the internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could certainly be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory, instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="1">One for all eventualities</seg>
<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V Honda forecasts to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a mini van.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds fairly overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well-finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit-top is falling down.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is not only a trunk of 453 l at high-level and 1026 l in reverse backrests, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical when it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema armchair and thus offer storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor up to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The luggage compartment can be loaded well, but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is likely to make his work somewhat quieter though.</seg>
<seg id="13">The average daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5 liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">A four-wheel drive is not available.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be somewhat more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "the equipment in the tested top variant" "" "Executive" "" "leaves nothing to be desired." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The security systems include the City emergency brake assistant (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "the collision alert sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles as" "" "approaching objects" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller responds to the traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed as needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">But full connectivity is available only for the top features: 7-inch touch screen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI socket are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who do not want to invest so much will get the petrol engine starting from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard.</seg>

<seg id="1">Better traffic on the motorway feeder</seg>
<seg id="2">It stalls regularly on the bypass road - here is a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this shall change: the rule of law shall be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the ambient road every evening in traffic jam when they drive over the freeway to Zubringer (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">The road construction is extended on Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August) in the area between the hammer street and the exit Weseler Straße the right turn track by 700 meters.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drivers can then travel directly from the hammer road to the right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The major advantage is that traffic is increasing early, which improves the overall flow rate on the busy section of the road 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the District of Münster-West.</seg>
<seg id="9">The road constriction on the feeder nerves the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="10">On weekdays, the return section extends up to the bridge across the Albersloe way and sometimes beyond.</seg>
<seg id="11">The reason is the coniferous needle on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler Straße.</seg>
<seg id="12">From here, traffic is only driven one lane by the motorway bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second track had to be built back almost three quarters of years ago.</seg>

<seg id="15">The competent national company cannot say how long this bottleneck and the associated work traffic jam is going to last.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, it has to be expected for years: because the bridge has an official residual service life of the year 2034.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing Night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning is already far from the wake of the wake-up ringing no more to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of the adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders express themselves?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons behind them, emphasising Hans-Günter Weeddy, member of the board of the German Society for Dreams and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands for the time being, however, is the Insomnia, that is, an inhalation and a breakdown-disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a result many people feel inadequate or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board at the German Medical Association with Practice in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is often a lot of depression," "" "said Wezu." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors condition each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, if you have a herniated disc, every two or three hours will wake up and possibly start to think about everyday problems and worries, there's an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I sleep with a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor, advises Weeddy.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: you are beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or even medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">Dr. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical centre at the Charité University Medicine Berlin, hardly exists in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why you should first contact your family doctor when it comes to sleeping problems.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to the sleep lab and what will happen?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, in the sleep laboratory doctors recommend snoring with breathing rash, in case of illness of the day, for sleepwalkers or if one does not find the cause of a breakdown disturbance, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">One does not really need to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "just don't take a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After the cladding one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a nose clip, a chest strap and a sensor on your finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">A camera on the ceiling also records the sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">It all counts: regular sleeping and standing times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid drinking alcohol and don't look at the watch at night - then you start to count immediately, and that is quite and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="5">"" "articles about this" "" "trendy district" "", "as known as the responsible property company Friedrichshain, are preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the inner senator of Berlin had spoken out several times for a tough action by the police against the project, the area referred to as "no-go zone" for police and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After having cleared the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, the police patrolled three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked up parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown landlords.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers followed the cheering of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about the späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who covers three children here, are especially annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">They share the fear of increasing rents and gentrification with the inhabitants of the house projects.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, who mostly wanted police protection from the vandalizing left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin interior senator and the police force between house occupiers and their neighbours, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class neighborhood which, compared to the rest of the city, has a low average age and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">House-occupations and the residential projects that are born from it have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße in the vicinity of the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been cleared in a regular street battle, many of the projects in the Riga were legalized and are still inhabited by the people whom they had occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become a magnet for tourists and election berliners from all over the world in recent years: people from the GDR times and former occupants now share their Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they can be seen on broken panes or freshly painted facades, which were sprayed with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other street was mentioned this year as often as" "" "left autonomous violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as assault are based on statistics almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most important part of the offences make occasional damage, which tends to meet the newly built houses and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is appeasing: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they are not destined to be.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer in the rigs.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "for the studied architecture, her street is not a criminal point, on the contrary:" "" "here you help each other, live together on the street and get more of each other than elsewhere." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has been deliberately drawn into the Riga road - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was also so important for the residents to get back their streets: from the police, politics and the media, which suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the neighbourhood in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: through faceless new buildings in former construction gaps that displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are, ultimately, condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so busy live here," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"I absolutely can't approve violence and destruction."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what to do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those drawn on colour bombs. the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who draws near should be aware of it - just like someone who pulls into a pub area, can complain about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons introduced with first names have asked not to be called by their proper name.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the Ombudsman for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social educator supports the team of administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working groups refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client from the working group suggests that the honorary officials are more than grateful that Deuschle is there, the husbandry Wollmilchsau, who has above all a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some - less ridicule than on the large number of desired areas - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">A management expert was sought out with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just as a sobering wool-milchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, Annika Deuschle writes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organizing, working with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as networking activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has limited a 50 percent position on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine client, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been to find homes for the connecting refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">Municipalities are responsible for connecting the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or hired residential premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">Responsibility changes from the councillor to the commune and job centre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it does not work so far as to be dependent on private dwellings, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments must be notorious as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are set up in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Outlook is the keyword, Regine Client and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and employment activities for refugees and migrants who need to be undone or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine client.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the yard or help master craftsmen, do charitable work - and that's motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But this activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and the customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So the administration and the volunteers are also jumping here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain to the refugees that it is just and they can spend time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever develops the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, may not work and be unprofitable, he will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are problems, says customer, "people with nothing at all." the work of Deuschle and client is therefore always motivating others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: have the two fears of radicalisation after the recent happenings, also in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine client says quite clearly," "" "what some naive might call." "" "a residual risk could and may not exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the attacks put them completely in demand.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine client.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">In other words, local and honorary officials have to look for activities on the spot and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in mind that soon a new push to refugees and migrants might come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, the policy is afraid.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to place them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"we haven't arrived in Urbach where we want to go," Annika Deuschle says.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's client also makes it clear that the creators are already used to integrate the existing human beings in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 persons, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
