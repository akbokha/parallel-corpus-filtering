Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ zing action in the Middle East .
it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington is critical of Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and rel@@ aun@@ ches Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal struck by the Iranian nuclear program by Obama has further deteri@@ or@@ ated .
in March , at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the US Congress , Net@@ any@@ ahu announced a controversial speech , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront of Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had declined this election in Israel with reference to his time im@@ min@@ ent .
in an emergency call Professor to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told a bit of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
Lamb was so important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and likely excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand written note scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ shed Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb had made the disa@@ strous distress call after it .
until the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb took the life when the police cl@@ en@@ ched him .
one day after the shooting at the university that forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb was motiv@@ ating .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his classes .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Social Sciences and History Department , whose faculty encompasses 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time , there were some tendencies towards problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he only taught two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic path to an employment as Assistant Professor .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb no longer can answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found a track record when he was again in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested Lamb self contained a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home at the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner , Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran into the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it wasn &apos;t immediately clear why lamb was going to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb opened his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he completed his doctorate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ term girl@@ friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and a lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
at that time he was the flock of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls mel@@ ted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail were both appearing on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier said that he had ended Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 . September , after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica qu@@ ill before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were in the open and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of she@@ ar .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first @-@ semester seminar program and specialised in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and student committee .
on Tuesday evening around 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commem@@ oration ceremony .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gi@@ l while the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ sters P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his distress called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
Toys R Us plan to employ fewer workers for the holiday season
Toys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer suggests that he will give the staff and seasonal workers a chance to work for more hours .
the company said that it plans to employ 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that this month it will start with job interviews and the number of employees increases from October to December .
while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business approaches , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to furnis@@ h shops with employees who sell , send and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox is jo@@ king about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Ro@@ y@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it will gradually become clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to my mind that I am a simul@@ ated yar@@ n and a length of it to be with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time @-@ travel film ever made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and selected movie cin@@ emas in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says that Russia &apos;s response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only ag@@ grav@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN chief again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations for finding a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France on the si@@ delines of the meeting of ministers of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation impossible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 survey values showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand it as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans are trying to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in poll@@ s , it has ( yet ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul .
of course it is too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump probably won the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at that time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ rin &apos;s leadership was given to the rising herd of Cain , none of which won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth are now recogni@@ zing Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s stamina and starting to drop their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values suggest@@ ing that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps Pop@@ ular values turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures remain in the early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a pol@@ l conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about pumping ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 per cent .
on the other hand 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republi@@ cans don &apos;t see Tr@@ um@@ ps Temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Republi@@ cans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the country &apos;s first country state , I@@ owa State , where the same 52 percent of Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their swe@@ eping hats , Republi@@ can voters keep Tr@@ ump for real .
if asked , who most likely wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change from the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at that time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a multip@@ licity of GO@@ P voters tr@@ um@@ ps campaign can be seen as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans were gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still beating everybody .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership while anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is spread to more than a dozen other Candi@@ dates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is re@@ aping the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , ahead of J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ himself and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate that strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a small majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ Fans says they have formed their mind .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have firmly forgiven their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nonetheless Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment the other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ surgeon , Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say that they have formed their mind are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump in the subject of immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign was calling immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; two months ago , the immigration pi@@ vot@@ al and pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse led to 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of pumping essential His@@ pan@@ o Americans will be kept away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage new orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey on Monday , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it seems to be Donald Tr@@ ump .
the fru@@ stration over the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry with Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa before two weeks shows that three out of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; in@@ fer@@ nal . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ art Trail is the most expensive housing estate - with a view over the North Sea resort .
in the street , a square meter of a th@@ at@@ ched house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the supply of objects is limited by nature , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which specific locations one square meter is the most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ ck in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , one of the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German dwell@@ ings - with square millimeter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro - per square metre .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is here exceptionally not at the top .
champi@@ ons League : dream start of Bavaria thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double Tor@@ ment@@ e in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller lev@@ elled the way to the FC Bayern 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign kick @-@ off of the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have a dream start in the &quot; Mission of Milan &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
team of coaches P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ e hit ( 8@@ 9th ) deser@@ ved with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth star success in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run .
Müller received a ben@@ evol@@ ent help from Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto in the Champions League at his 28th place in the Champions League .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m before the game at Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his latest six home matches in the premi@@ er category , among them famous clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled here .
but the Bavaria , defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they were cour@@ a@@ geous in their offensive efforts , but often too inno@@ cu@@ ous to work .
the attacks were introduced too often by reloc@@ ating to the left @-@ hand side of Douglas Costa , which was rarely seen against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k was hit from the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half .
first , when Olymp@@ us @-@ Stur@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown beat the Pol@@ es head @-@ ball from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct transfer , the go@@ al@@ keeper was par@@ ed with the knee ( 3@@ 5. ) .
even though the Bav@@ arians moved into their habit@@ ual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could place con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous need@@ les .
but at the door@@ keeper , Manuel Neu@@ er was reli@@ eved .
so for instance , when he had a shot of idea about the latte ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola made a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center alongside Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who did it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside initially .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Vice President Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him , when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the beaten Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
Götz@@ e arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller another one .
before the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ al in the stadium .
after a smaller group of war@@ med Bavaria fans in their audience blo@@ c apparently provoked the supporters of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and proce@@ eded with clas@@ hes against the Munich parti@@ sans .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
this does not only harm the lungs but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term study .
good news : if cancelled , the risk drops rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is based on the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison with non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.5 to 3.6 barrels .
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
root causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflammation of the g@@ ums , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
smoking is a risk factor for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss therefore goes back to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay .
people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years until the endanger@@ ment falls back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , first author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , said head of study H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and containers and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health down to old age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness shared the DI@@ f@@ E .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ pins the findings .
archae@@ ologists come across ves@@ tiges of late Anti@@ quity in Cologne &apos;s Rhine river
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
near the building site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings have excav@@ ated , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans have been searching for so @-@ called land monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always called up as a department for archaeological excav@@ ation .
in the third phase of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists were now five .
it has already been known from text documents that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had a church , explained Trier .
in addition to rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with about 350 graves , probably belonging to the church .
young woman captured by freight train
after a young woman is caught up at the train station in the l@@ aces of the violin , the Federal Police asks the people for help .
early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 o &apos;clock the woman crossed the track from the train station building at the end of the train station and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
as a result of the acquisition of the train , it has carried the most serious injuries to the Federal Police .
she was treated with emergency care on the spot and taken to a hospital by ambul@@ ance personnel .
on the basis of the noc@@ tur@@ nal Equ@@ al crossing of the young woman there are no findings to the killing officials .
the incident was probably witnessed by witnesses or residents have heard of acoustic percep@@ tions .
there are residents or p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by from Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , bak@@ eries , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) .

European Commission proposes new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
in order to mi@@ tig@@ ate the dispute on the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement TT@@ IP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private lighting equipment for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system that corresponds to significantly more traditional courts in its functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to be trusted by citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mr Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in charge of the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swedish has the intention of introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the US free trade talks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP will create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings stipul@@ ate specifically that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come from the EU , the US and third countries .
the second instance is scheduled for the first time .
it would allow it to appeal against sentences .
so far , the parties involved agreed among themselves to arbit@@ rators , but there was no obj@@ ection to their jud@@ gements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months it has become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust in fair@@ ness and fair@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work towards an International Investment Court according to its own specifications .
there could , for example , settle disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , particularly demanded by large corporations , are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary on which companies can bid for compensation for tax pay@@ ers , le@@ verage national laws or en@@ force a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act treated the Commission &apos;s proposals as insufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all it was critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German Economic Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as great progress .
during the reform , the Commission considered essential points that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel formulated in spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the legal action of the economy by too many new rules .
in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises might be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
the discussions on the TT@@ IP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) trade agreement remained unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been ongoing since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is regarded as un@@ sustainable .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
11 years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( now : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the frigh@@ tening acting folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost seized by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells the story of various places that he repeatedly records on the map , about his meticul@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they originated and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderfully creative person .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs appear that are harmonious very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into a great opul@@ ent .
rum@@ or has come , &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 US states should be rec@@ alled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in the proximity of the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and positively canc@@ els certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live guitar and ban@@ jo are enough for him .
a year later , the musician who lives in New York returns to the show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) a comprehensive masterpiece appears in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bor@@ dering ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no season list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ ore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth neat studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and rever@@ b .
far from the smaller clubs , the stage shows become a colourful spectacle made of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large @-@ lumin@@ escent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as a member of a five member band .

&quot; &quot; &quot; theater presents mainly the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although here now almost 2000 guests sit in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and to folk .
without directing a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad @-@ enriched album .
from the audience one hears : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and one can &quot; throw away the &quot; plate in essence . &quot;
only one en@@ core thank@@ ed St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s modest , plays acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally dec@@ lines under thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut in the Prime Minister Fra@@ ction
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister Fra@@ gest@@ ing is expected with tension
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will be making his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questions and for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after noon while his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during singing the national an@@ them during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the centre of several title @-@ pages @-@ stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; in respect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two Week@@ ly program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independently &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of Shadow ministers have refused to serve Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are referring to differences in economics , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a leader .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acking within Labour , and Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour has set out to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow working and reti@@ ring minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limitation of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23.@@ 000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory Bos@@ s over the last decade , over the Dis@@ patch box across Parliament .
the Labour leader who has promised a different policy approach says that he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 requests .
Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will refra@@ in from tackl@@ ing serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic minist@@ erial secretary , will represent him if he does not take part - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also had the idea that other colleagues would occasionally take the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the spokesperson of the House , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a P@@ unch and P@@ unch Theatre , often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s questions . but some years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the question was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Comm@@ ons and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needs extensive reforms .

Po@@ und increases by accelerated growth in the United Kingdom
the pound le@@ aps forward according to data showing a rise in wage growth in the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid objective of SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , earnings without any Bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
since 2009 , this percentage was the fastest and provided estim@@ ation of the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were higher than encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0,@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ t &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion by a stock sale as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares of Mon@@ di &apos;s packaging and paper company were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his estimate for the company rating on &apos; sell &apos; .
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages would end@@ anger expansion .
J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers would mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs at its company , &quot; he says .
the cost could hit the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber in the Capital : on Bie@@ ber @-@ Expedition in Berlin
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar .
twenty @-@ one 21 years young , a hand@@ shake with an upper @-@ lay@@ ered flag .
the type with plat@@ inum @-@ blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy .
more likely even more .
at present , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 rot@@ ates through .
like Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Polish luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz in Berlin is sitting on the cold stone s@@ labs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bie@@ ber Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : here you live I@@ dol , whose poster is attached to St@@ et@@ tin since Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the suite in which the Canadian singer lives , cost exactly as much as her Mama E@@ wa deserves in half a year .
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the tenth class in the Gymnasium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fulfill her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compulsory school light ?
who is it@@ ching ?
the fans do not .
also Bie@@ ber itself does not .
that has taken care of anyway .
for the advertisement in the super market &apos;s promotional campaign , he collected three million dollars , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ple company flus@@ hed many , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber account .
and with each doll , which looks like he and goes over the counter , Bie@@ ber also collects .
when Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , you wonder at the window pane .
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say that the hyp@@ e would go too far .
others emphasize that Bie@@ ber was finally in the US and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; on No. 1 .
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , does not interest the many zer@@ os first .
at least he does .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Leban@@ ese to the idea of a potato twe@@ eter
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
both are done - in the potato twe@@ eter , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a plac@@ ard of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement Al@@ ha@@ y has put potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a plac@@ ard at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen random on TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes , is spinning in his shop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is multic@@ ultur@@ alism for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea has meanwhile been made by the Leban@@ ese by the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
that &apos;s why Al@@ ha@@ y doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y how much meat and how many potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
only so much : &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; he finds .
culinary understanding is also well received by its customers .
Met@@ cash launches Biodi@@ versity campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - As@@ sum@@ ption
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million dollar Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and expand the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump onboard , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop@@ keepers who sell cheap tickets to the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment will conduct its annual Invest@@ ors Strate@@ gic Day .
there is a lot in the game as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to roughly 14 percent in eastern countries .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will catch around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retail@@ er could lose 360 million turnover per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
loss in food and food business and in quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed costs could cost $ 13 million in earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will reduce food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told about a business in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the Executive Board has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , i@@ Gas market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operational debt reduction at the same time on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , mer@@ ges and inv@@ ests over $ 150 million to offset sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products every week and to enhance I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by rapidly growing fresh foods and delivering a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Chief Executive Officer Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and re@@ charging programs to El@@ an will grow and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Chur@@ ta and deserves praise as criticism for his own behavior according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is always known as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with the not@@ orious confrontation of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification play in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati shortly after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison called : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have beaten Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cr@@ amp ver@@ ted a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ son of He@@ aly was defended ste@@ ad@@ fast .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty rich about is the fact that after my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was pulled into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a fight in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open even under the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he adapts to the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also did not consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z &apos;s decision to take into account the important preliminary decision which begins on Friday and describes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; joint decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term integral part of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I think Nick made very quick to climb what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray noted . he goes up in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to support him , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency , closes the border , with@@ ers refugees
Hungary declared the emergency and negotiated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that tried to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Ser@@ b officials re@@ acted with indignation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants were forced to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the B@@ order ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian stand @-@ by police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some rejected food and water from protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border ended a day after the 28 @-@ year blo@@ c at a meeting in Brussels , where no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the p@@ ump@@ y Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would receive a further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the crisis of immigration of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency situation , which was launched on Tuesday in two southern regions , gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country would also envis@@ age the construction of a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania , in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison people were deployed in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , prime minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the incoming economic refugees are seeking a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws which entered into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damaging of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) fence built by the government along the southern border to Serbia . these laws also impose higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the deployment of the military expected next week , but Repor@@ ters by Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes against the new laws .
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia following a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos cir@@ cl@@ ed the main border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and put a crowd in order to push themselves there .
around 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders eliminated in national survey
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins on the ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 per cent of the voters in the primary elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( rising by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is fighting for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the voters of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidates they will support .
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders earned some profits .
Clinton has a major advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased .
her support for the men has dropped mark@@ edly , and S@@ anders is only 5 points behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage over 50 years of democratic voters has dissi@@ p@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are at the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Clinton has a big advantage over the older constitu@@ ents .
last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a two @-@ digit margin in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the voters &apos; democratic voters say that they would support Clinton , if nominated by the Party .
a quarter would support them with some precau@@ tions and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps it &apos;s not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are thri@@ lled above all by her .
the views are more mixed with those currently don &apos;t support Clinton , only a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the voters &quot; democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can voters say this about their peak channel data Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
from Clinton &apos;s supporters her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) is also mentioned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with the problems and the eligi@@ bility are also cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Vice President re@@ jects a potential for the Pres@@ idency of the Council , 57 percent of the elected voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters want to vote on who would be their second choice for the party , be@@ aver is at the top .
more than half of Clinton &apos;s supporters say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advance ahead of S@@ anders raises from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has dropped from 78 percent in the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second at this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions on their eligi@@ bility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similarly as last month , no single democr@@ at candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries stands out as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates achieve good results in some important tra@@ its in elec@@ tive sel@@ ections of their party .
there are maj@@ orities in Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
among the three candidates , Bi@@ den best cuts off in hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democratic voters in the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for all of these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server are still being questioned as Minister of Foreign Affairs during the term of office , most Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions .
but it is another story in the American public overall .
half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
the public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s overall opinion , although 36 percent said that her opinion has wor@@ sen@@ ed her .
there are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six out of 10 who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of her party , this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters : only 32 percent see her as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not consider it an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote do not consider dr@@ unk@@ enness , honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , get good marks on leadership .
out of the six candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches Donald Tr@@ ump at national survey
Ben Car@@ son is close to Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times
in the meantime half of the voters &apos; support in the new survey dropped to the two candidates , and others lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers across the country . support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS Survey conducted prior to Fox News Wednesday in the last month to 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son plays well with demographic groups and sur@@ passes the ump among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , has been kno@@ cked off with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell the deepest , from 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are 6 % in third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son climb@@ s in the poll@@ s - with 19 % support with the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the ump with 32 % support .
the recent pol@@ l of ABC News / Washington Post revealed ump clearly before Car@@ son .
with a view to a Car@@ son rising last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa .
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers already have a trip to the Mediterranean to find warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a pleasure for a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the waters in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week , with the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
pool temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it &apos;s even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic Sea it is 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .

five members of the Brotherhood were bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch college newcom@@ er
almost two years after a student died during a bul@@ ous ritual of a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder was filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ si Brotherhood brut@@ ally attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a ritual ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police .
officials said he had been loaded with a 30 pound ruck@@ sack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital like the police .
but they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to get advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide the fossi@@ ls and basically set the good of the Brotherhood about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ shed Chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning on his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g repeatedly added injury to the head , trunk and th@@ igh with bl@@ unt force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the ch@@ ic@@ anes each year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer representing the D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended a charge for murder of third counts for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of religious attacks and the formation of a criminal union .
&quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organisation which - officially or in@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also be accoun@@ table for it , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation with the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rise in interest comes , and the household will fall down , returns for bonds will rise and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance on how to proceed .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve on raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments are re@@ acting .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated due to a rise in interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal levels , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effects .
here , a look at historical trends is based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases may make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency that assets yield 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what is happening after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market in the past 35 years is usually in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to raising interest , rather flat in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal after 500 days , with an average yield in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a recent analysis , which Bob D@@ oll , head of investment strategy at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares would tend to occur later in the raising cycle and the return thus begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not happen before and which could speed up a recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product near its lowest point will be at a higher interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 decreased only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
while the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few anticipate that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether this is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all year round , market participants agreed on a rate rise of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the session of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading will only have a 25 percent chance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all the erosion cycles from 1950 to the present day have taken place in a super @-@ cycle with an increasing tide of GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ sk@@ ies are put into the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period .
the current cycle is by far the longest waiting the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this is 74 months so far .
fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates a rate rise , and the pattern is fairly similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that bonds are quicker than with stocks if they change their strategic course .
in the case of bonds the returns appear to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the raising cycle the bond issues drop immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to yields coming closer together between longer and shorter loans and leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high interest rates often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher income , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
it is interesting , Jones insi@@ sts that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are a few signs that the market adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , bor@@ rowing have expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all the features of the market , if the F@@ ed ag@@ grav@@ ates its strategy .
large and large companies , who deal with the greater part of their business operations in the United States , will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt are getting worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to respond very positively three months after an initial interest rate rise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
firms with a strong balance sheet exceeded by 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high @-@ capital returns and low volati@@ lity in their shares exceeded their counter@@ parts with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most , Gold@@ man said .
consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar outside of pure equity .
savers could see gains through higher revenues , even if experts of different opinions are just how fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says MP member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of Parliament critic@@ ised the station for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; du@@ mm@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also referred to BBC Music Awards and said that they were only The Br@@ its im@@ itated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maintains a leading MP and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew B@@ ingham , Conserv@@ ative Euro MP , also told the BBC bos@@ ses that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public broad@@ ca@@ ster and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ish@@ able from his commercial opponents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under another name The Br@@ its .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham stated .
BBC Director General re@@ jects the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn anywhere else about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is truly un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works , I think really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controllers Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he had to work harder to engage the public when it did so in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport for the commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory de@@ pu@@ ties Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Richter - was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; produced in a special BBC way &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house barn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it launches the next time a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to spend money for other entertainment formats .
net sales increased in August and Black Friday may be responsible
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month there was the lowest income since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday slow@@ ed down the issues in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has dri@@ lled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say that there are now signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , Editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales unit of the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that is comm@@ uting , and we will possibly experience that growth will dimin@@ ish .
the Black @-@ Friday @-@ phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the subsequent revenues .
experts believe that purch@@ as@@ ers hold back their purchases from this event held on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe Black Friday , on which buyers were batt@@ ling for bar@@ gains , could stop shop@@ pers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 expenditure was spent a little more than £ 1 online .
for some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in m@@ ec@@ ca by crane accident killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are borne by Muslims in the first bur@@ ial in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia breaks down the collapse partly of the huge Saudi bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury those who were killed as a crane collap@@ sed to Mec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ ma .
mour@@ ners filled , largely dressed in white , the route to pay their respect when the first of the dead came to the Al @-@ Mo@@ aissance ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ yard .
the proc@@ ession went on to the holy place , where only days before a building crane flow@@ ed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed@@ side .
the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi King imposed a sanc@@ tion on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster that also left 3@@ 94 injured .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 people who were killed as a crane hit the Great Central Black Sea of Mec@@ ca were carried by the streets .
among the dead there was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , supported by the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual p@@ addle in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officials have already firmly said that the p@@ addle to Mec@@ ca will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden group would not have allowed the arm of the crane to stand when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group is in charge of collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was forbidden to travel abroad .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man had to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which fell into an inner courtyard of the Great Wall , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the p@@ addle , which was later held this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also rebu@@ ked the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ ma as part of the massive building project led by the Bin Laden Group .
the bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi royal family for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a apost@@ ate son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s .
the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said 158 people remain in hospital .
government officials arranged that 1 million wh@@ ale ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently wounded .
other injured will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Bos@@ s says that the time of cheap East European craftsmen is over
British increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe has sur@@ passed
this leads to the opening of 200 more scre@@ am shops target@@ ing professional tra@@ des@@ men .
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets throughout the country
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled Eastern European arti@@ sans who carry out the work in their home .
if you can use a hammer or brush to brush walls , nowadays it seems to be a minority .
because British increasingly employ arti@@ sans to perform DIY jobs in their homes , the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the Bau@@ markt @-@ Chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe , which offer services at low prices , is now out@@ dated .
so King@@ fis@@ her is planning to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions are taken by women .

she said it was necessary to face growing demographic trends with more female single households having to do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a majority of men in our stores . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to shift this to a balance more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients are made up of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .

officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball assistant A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and de@@ for@@ estation .
the def@@ end@@ ants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them had also been accused of abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted in force in May of this accus@@ ation .
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ sed in the preliminary investigation that the accused were used in the years 2006 to 2011 mon@@ ies of club accounts , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also accused of financial years .
this fact separated the chair@@ woman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
the def@@ ection of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity was that the society did not have any assets under any circumstances .
the sports officials had only charged expenses and the sports club , for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a great deal of time and money , the Pas@@ si@@ va amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) in 2001 .
&quot; back then we were standing before the situation : do we continue the club or block us ? , &quot; said one of the def@@ end@@ ants , in the profession of a large @-@ scale lawyer in the financial department .
with his co @-@ worker and co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants , he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insurance as a security to the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can freely admini@@ ster the money , it is not allowed to pay any debts .
furthermore , in the event of a corresponding financial success , the dis@@ bur@@ sement of expenses compens@@ ations was determined retro@@ spec@@ tively by 1991 .
therefore , one has paid off part of the expenses compens@@ ations only years later , namely from the year 2003 when it was a plus on the account .
this was the reason why package deals and not detailed revers@@ als appeared , the former Chairman outlined the processes .
the accounts and divisions managed to divide the two def@@ end@@ ants together , said the second def@@ end@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the pay@@ outs have not been disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in the detail of the financial arm@@ ament , but it is important that only the freedom of debt has been , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 , against which an official investigation began because of abuse of office , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association account .
these were set@@ backs , the def@@ end@@ ants declared .
this securities account ran to the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and , according to its statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not answer for a long time .
then he finally thought that he was the best for the society .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor placed in the room .
the co @-@ accused was informed , justified his function@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer has been formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why compensation ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation because the association had never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a lawyer ? &quot; he asked .
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never gave a cent pay , he only spent mil@@ eage and di@@ eting .
he added 1,000 euros per month to di@@ ets , but the actual expendi@@ tures were much higher , he added .
the accused were not able to prove accurate documents for the early years .
these were no longer kept after an audit , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
the second def@@ end@@ ant also obtained a kilomet@@ re allowance .
in his statement , he explained in his statement that all fixes have to be made in cash , and from his place of residence , he had to drive to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence .
the trial resum@@ ed on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard presents another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff reduction that has been running for three years , the computer can disman@@ tle further jobs when the company spl@@ its .
the positions of the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) have no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its corporate customer segment .
this means that costs amounting to 2.@@ 7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) should be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be incurred from the fourth quarter .
the extraction of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for the past three years .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP still employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ share gave a 2.3 percent follow @-@ up .
the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto group , who has grown up with printers , is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printer business is to be pool@@ ed in a new society - separated from the more promising areas of computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business segments are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a further dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo last minute .
the sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have deployed the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water head@@ lights against several hundred refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the termination of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it , a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen , a water@@ row@@ er was standing .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
at first , the officials started to spray the pepper spray .
then the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now pulled a little back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured wife was removed from the zone .
the children who had inhal@@ ed the tear , cried out .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world is watching when the US central bank is coming together two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest has been raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surv@@ eyed by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , which was last week of view that the F@@ ed will do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and will keep the interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed set interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Head of Staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a move are good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 8@@ pm CE@@ T on Thursday
death cont@@ emp@@ t at Delta State University left sorry
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that &quot; I &apos;m sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said , He shot on someone and killed anyone .
Lamb told the employee of the emergency call centre that the police had to send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give it .
Lamb had no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written record from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted I could und@@ o it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note Lamb went about 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally killed his own life on Monday evening when police surrounded him .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly thought that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt also , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning met for about three years with Lamb .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les
the police said Lamb had called for relatives at a particular time on Monday to tell them &quot; he did not go to prison . &quot;
when police captured him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to the forest , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a doctoral degree from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , such as his life @-@ law on the University &apos;s website .

among other things , Lufthansa no longer exists for the passenger &apos;s business in the future .
the cheap airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independent as possible .
in the future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the executive team headed by Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ tures
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this brought the left external def@@ enders to weeping and closing it for at least six months from the game , Louis van Ga@@ al doesn &apos;t give up hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V range .
he was treated nine minutes in the field and needed oxygen before being brought to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said van Ga@@ al : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double be@@ acon and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be la@@ yed tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very hard and then fantas@@ tically plays , and then that happens .
he had an oxygen mask in the dressing room .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it takes six months , and it won &apos;t play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al gu@@ essed that the Italian refer@@ ee had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet sent to Sha@@ ws account : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I get stronger again . &quot;

Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a sur@@ ge when Mexico viol@@ ated Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very hard because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Coc@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very sick with it . I &apos;m so sorry about it .

surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental label of Dr. Se@@ uss , published in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read to my children because it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron osten@@ si@@ bly describes the story of the book , instead gives a summary of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the pretty short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ ose @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , by listening to her true name The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this is not yet suspi@@ cious : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the Internet Movie Database website , and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ose @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to being a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the story of the book . here an un@@ named boy hears , how the local environment is devast@@ ated by the prot@@ rac@@ ted , trees adul@@ ter@@ ated , th@@ inn@@ y kn@@ itting Once @-@ ler , a ho@@ vering , sn@@ u@@ gg@@ ish nature , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax twice in a row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Dow@@ ning @-@ Street speaker said the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s electoral circuit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but gave no further comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
facing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a down@@ side .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks Page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
Mo@@ een Ali has developed with the ball as a spin @-@ punch and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown quantity at test level is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th is out of the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyze .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best sel@@ ections .
long ago one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he was in control of his own fate .
hopefully when he kno@@ cks out more of Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude even if he didn &apos;t perform such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test dr@@ one gets to put his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - as Sam Rob@@ son got in front of him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and backwards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first claimed Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he &apos;s a drummer , whom I set highly .
he is an X @-@ Factor Cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this of course depends on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of making Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and would receive four qui@@ cks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this lef@@ ty has already shown that he &apos;s a cri@@ cket player .
mos@@ een might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is he a number 3 for her , and there &apos;s no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before he joined the op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately made three hundred re@@ inde@@ er and did not look back .
afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he was very impressed as a young man .
people may see their stat@@ s on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some wise additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ ie , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences , since he played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful insert into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights we can benefit from .
sometimes new voices can wind up in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Gary &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used at the One @-@ Day@@ z , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you have to remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .

Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb at summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wants a UK @-@ looking UK inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and allows more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials to come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go .
German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened with the over@@ power@@ ing endurance runners such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande is looking back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain is a lef@@ tist one .
it is difficult to imagine that they will take a leg to help the British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s withdrawal from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
as a result , some such ministers may even intentionally not plan any helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to ha@@ sten the Bre@@ x@@ it process is suspected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won none of its ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of press images , as it did during the 1975 referendum , inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our 1973 entry with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can &apos;t remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made a name for themselves as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s .
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ed foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals who have most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but found out that when you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , better ban@@ anas are distributed to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened up a backdoor .
the press never denied it .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly fl@@ aps on my back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time to waste me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ year @-@ old , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it friendly - in development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional leaf @-@ off tendency and the wild ret@@ inu@@ e of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ men can certainly say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary said , &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ett &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and television this week , when the boy sc@@ outs had fought in it , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &quot; s when his old father tried to be il@@ lo@@ y@@ ally loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; remain &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s term - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow campaig@@ ners and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he has touched me - news @-@ discipline is important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron any free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep up with Lab@@ ours in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mr Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ett Siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past , is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities for NATO - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in everything a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - in order to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of something about the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum at the start on Monday .
experts critici@@ ze Public Health &apos;s report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 individuals who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) in order to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Resources ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references from BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting said to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not provided , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ ci@@ gar champi@@ ons , some of which also provide a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco bat@@ on of P@@ he took part at the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; signi@@ fies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence of the damage of most products in most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have served as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that he was already re@@ acting to the claims of BM@@ J .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we will continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
he has the un@@ ambig@@ uous duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in relation to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people annually die of a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System 2 billion pounds per year .
due to the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ ers , former CEO of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programmes such as East@@ ers and The Voice . he said commercial ri@@ vals would give &quot; their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ law programmes that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in a hard @-@ disputed time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and TV stations such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC general director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried for six years in his time with Channel 4 without success to come into contact with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broad@@ cast@@ ed , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee within the framework of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , what I don &apos;t think medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least give your production to programs that others do not do or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financing programs that could be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ender is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I am trying to see how this should be public @-@ law television .
I don &apos;t think that would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular shows give what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart award in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ ers should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ law ni@@ ches should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue when they go to their osten@@ si@@ bly missions to justify 4 billion pounds broad@@ cast@@ ers , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the broadcast fee , Johnson told the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , think of all , we all think that one receives a great value for £ 150 a year , but for people who are worth £ 150 a lot of money , wonder if that is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday called for the BBC to check its ethics mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , form and maintain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0,1 % on the radio - and they should change in &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain &quot; to the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
on the issue of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial channels to make alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetic &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells genetically modified to wear the membrane channels that respond to ultras@@ onic waves .
related topics : researchers read and write Brain Activity with Light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetic , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the process of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that induc@@ es electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms do not generally respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani realized that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro ves@@ icles and transferred into the worms , where they turn on the modified motor neur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with genetic genetic , a ground breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with stim@@ uli of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Sizegenetics might have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that has to be sent down to the desired location in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ onic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily vulnerable to ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for specific neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

according to Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will get critical and try to bring political works to the public outside of galleries .
many artists turn to work with activists within protest movements and realize that they must move outside into the real world , so that their art has an influence on society .

the Am@@ ne@@ sty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works char@@ itable with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ eover artist , who also works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that was around the advertising for the weapons trade fair - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic floating company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ stering with bright colors and animation , it remains to stick stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty .
what we need now is an intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally outside our door@@ step .

eight golden rules for life in student residen@@ ces
11 years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se s@@ miles of those I have been angry - and the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly nerve @-@ wra@@ cking to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell you where you are coming from , and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ax , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you don &apos;t love or hate Mar@@ m@@ ite because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract hair ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you wouldn &apos;t talk , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burned and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers were .
let people leave .
people &apos;s rooms are often transformed into drinks reception , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people are attrac@@ ting themselves and turning their under@@ wear .
related to this : don &apos;t remember to start a relationship with a university
intro@@ ver@@ ted received a rough treatment at the university .
her room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in cultivation allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy that I used to interact with you . &quot;
try to feel when a company is exhausted by con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send it an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos stum@@ bling : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship conclude by che@@ ering .
since you start the university on the peak of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people to introduce yourself to a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have baked something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and end up perhaps associ@@ ating your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poorly mixed cl@@ um@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you drop .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check this with the milk owner .
chances are good that they say to serve themselves even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my sympathy , but try to deal with more balanced than my room@@ mate , who added a washing up liquid to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that stops people from sleep or work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors , whether it &apos;s something for them , drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter than three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more list@@ less music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would move into the same residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be ground@@ less embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , go to them , separate them , and then see them every day , and perhaps see how they all come across all common friends ?
of course the heart goes his own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future marriage partner , at least try to persu@@ ade your under@@ body a little reason .
in the exciting moment when you realize that someone has left his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an Ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is more thin than it seems .
a good trick is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never trust someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but do not paint your possessions on the ceiling more than twice .
town@@ houses for Refu@@ ge@@ es , Single Det@@ er@@ ers , S@@ ear@@ ners
real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner builds in central Fran@@ con@@ ian corner terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need room space , but also the mother and the low @-@ ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show you how to build a good and good building even today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushing for the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes in knowing how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are going to push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people stay here for a large part .
in view of the flow of refugees , we need enough living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution .
guil@@ d : a row house needs the least amount of space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you expose people in blocks of living .
each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say , it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their respective needs .
what are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
do building regulations complic@@ ate their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have correctly drawn up my project .
it is particularly complicated that the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ ine value is special construction and the Ord@@ in@@ ance of the Ord@@ in@@ ance .
cr@@ un@@ chy .
it is still under@@ lined who creates three apartments in a semi @-@ detached house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers don &apos;t have cars .
how did the local residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
which definitely is not right .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true that in the last five years we had a building boom in Germany , but it was built luxury apartments that can hardly afford one more .
my project has the message , even ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees but also the single mother or the low @-@ wage ear@@ ner .
I show you how to build a good and good building even today .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about .

some have encountered problems after installation , as they receive an error message indicating that the &quot; software update is failing . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are recommended to either wait for the rush to go back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has made this more unlikely through the stream@@ lining of the update . similarly , it will be easier to do so by using a special tool to delete apps and re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may switch to half way and this could lead to a demoli@@ tion of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only a motto in the fight for the championship title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes te@@ amm@@ ate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; before the start , the World Cup runner @-@ up pointed out in the crucial seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up champion ahead of the race in Singapore on this Sunday by defending champion and double champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on already won seven of the 12 rounds of the season and will also attack the Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
2009 and last year the 30 year old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .
a ha@@ ze bell hangs over the town for days , caused by fires on the neighbouring island of Sum@@ atra .
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen , founded three months ago , has included another member in his ranks , thus the number of members increased to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who stayed for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to K@@ ur .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bearer of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1 . class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , which was accepted by Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record players who cannot raise the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search should also be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connec@@ t@@ edness with the spa town .
district Office is looking for direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ elli &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new starting point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations you can also participate in courses .
the Social Foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain to the inner city .
more precisely , to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the purchasing market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ing will immediately receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or services of health care and nursing staff .
for years we have established with our ambul@@ atory nursing service that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also often not many benefits paid by the insur@@ ers because the complexity of the insurance companies is scar@@ c@@ ely understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new land@@ lady J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Civil Hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers preventive , health courses and wellness .
to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or a physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment can be used .
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other ideally .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is evident in the demographic change .
this is because this makes a good de@@ centralised infrastructure in the individual neighbour@@ hoods of Bam@@ berg in the future indispensable .
in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to lon@@ el@@ iness in old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ alizing . &quot;
this makes the Foundation a great contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment .
the lod@@ g@@ ings office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only then will it be decided whether the meadow will be shown or not .

witnesses seek the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mouth : on Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mouth .
one from the group , a sev@@ ent@@ een @-@ year old Afgh@@ an , was followed by the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point the group was at the height of the b@@ ft @-@ gas station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now cried out to the young people and hit him with his fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al rup@@ ture and ble@@ ed strongly out of the nose .
when his two friends rus@@ hed in and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he left his victim first .
from his friends , the wounded young man was brought home .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator followed the group with a car up to their home and demonstr@@ atively passed several times there .
when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured man went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was again attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male .
with the aid of a stroke , you tested the victim &apos;s face and thi@@ ghs .
the wounded person had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
to date , there is only one vag@@ ue description of the perpet@@ rators .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Fel@@ ic@@ epr@@ ints and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Governing Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased .
in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are lucky : on October 1 , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of fel@@ low@@ ships .
while Ur@@ sel &apos;s retirement is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich continues to be on his side in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller re@@ opened the practice on 12 October , until then he invested € 3@@ 10,000 in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when the fel@@ low@@ ships met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who are currently completing their specialist training at the Ver@@ den hospital and also wants to get into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ie and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was ready , I just called it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
married couple Mu@@ eller liked the idea to practice their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clos@@ eness and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany our families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss soon .
and so they agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father , Frank Müller , grew up there , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several doctor &apos;s offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a senior ambul@@ ance in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ Re@@ gency Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19 , the new boss will be prepared for the new boss .
while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ic@@ ausen operates as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) specializes in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the land@@ owners , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as general practitioners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end@@ os@@ copy is therefore out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the renovation , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EC@@ Gs and require a subscri@@ ber room more .
in addition , the computer is completely re@@ done .
a grant of € 50,000 will be given to the mill@@ er within the scope of a subsi@@ dy programme from the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says M. Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l approximately 2000 patients come to the field of Fel@@ ic@@ epr@@ ints , according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 500 in the average German average practice .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another GP practice .
a positive side effect of the practical acceptance by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ie .
if there were no success@@ ors , it would have gone too .
those who visit Müll@@ ers &apos;s office hours also still look especially in familiar faces : take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning force from the ri@@ ms .
with their departure , an era ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf , after all the doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remembered Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ie , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she feels a bit of melanch@@ oly after a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mus@@ or and will surely see many patients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband compl@@ ements : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I &apos;ve always been pushing gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also set up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister for Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; controls on the Hungarian border are maintained in parallel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is clear that everyone who wants to make a request for asylum can do so &quot; of course . &quot;
care and safety of people stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear that there are clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia is considering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Slovenia refuses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian government had previously informed that Slovenia would also leave arriving refugees in Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
this is what the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar therefore did not see in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia was already strongly controlled as the outer limit of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Slovenian therefore does not want to abri@@ dge its borders for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill out his obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to leave eastern Croatia on the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could attack them in the nearby fields of ma@@ ize .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees continually arrived in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in action .
in the coming days , his country reck@@ ons with about 4000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , Bus@@ es from Pres@@ evo would be re@@ directed to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously been migrants to the Hungarian border , re@@ directed Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government in Belgrade denied that it was the people to propose certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the morning , and in the course of the day more buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had travelled all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , some 500 kilometres away from Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary made it , so the police said we were to go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually lead to the postpon@@ ement of the former Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a slightly further west @-@ west route .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared corresponding plans for possible exceptional situations in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call for details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 . since then , the EU partners have consistently provided a good testimony to the standards of border controls .
on the Serbian side there are still approximately 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they spent the night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed .
it is still unclear whether the remaining refugees continue to travel to the Croatian border .
the Serbian Interior Minister , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic , tried to calm the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not act at the moment for very high refugee figures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are drawn by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area , there are still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields 20 years after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the captured information , in@@ sider trading should have been made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars was launched to the investig@@ ators .

this is why this public @-@ effective 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
however , that not everyone wants to publicly express themselves on the boards , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal matter .

F@@ ed@@ Ex approach mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its freight transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for holidays .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. proclaimed a profit of $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year ending next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in earlier forecasts .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower rate of view comes despite the price increases , which will be 4.@@ 9 percent on average and effective on 4 January and despite higher charges for transporting shipments of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November onwards .
the company said , however , that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and growth in online trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company takes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid earnings when considering the weaker than anticipated economic conditions , above all in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for vacation employment were announced one day later as the rival UPS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which analysts predicted by Z@@ ack Investment Research analysts .
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks disputed analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
over the past few years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which delivered sales in its unit Express shipping to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ assurance .
the Express Unit reported higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result was due to higher labor costs in the freight business .
in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most awa@@ ited conference in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gies spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States lies im@@ pending over them at the end of the orn@@ ate , two @-@ story se@@ ater hall .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed president , Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues , should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : maxim@@ ising U.S. employment and prices stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision too narrow to predict . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentives by the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data on the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxi@@ ous to increase this volati@@ lity by raising interest for federal loans - and be it only by a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they are observing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ au , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rate , increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justification for continuing to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures itself to the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted interest rates this week .
the financial markets , however , expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator showing only a 30 % chance of an up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment .
this indicates a drop in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts allevi@@ ate the impact by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage J@@ umped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was raised by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the proposition in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that point , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets , so that they won &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a rate rise would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
one month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in a good way to raise the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence was expected .
although job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % in the past month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed regards as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation went steadily below the target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world watched together at the end of last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average figure fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would cur@@ b global growth .
the market has recovered something this month , whereby D@@ ow is now almost 10 % below the pole of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation , when one should increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events on the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred over the past few weeks , they would put the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and former staff of the US central bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the global health of the global economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision making process .
but in the end the F@@ ed has become the world &apos;s monetary authority .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
the mere reference by Ben S Bern@@ anke at that time in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; her monetary expansion , dis@@ b@@ anded confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined can be expected from the F@@ ed representatives that they will not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your decision making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ier , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , re@@ marked that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that are apparently not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ier , member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which is committed to raise interest rates , quoted Dec@@ isions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited det@@ ectable effects on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives did reverse these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market crisis , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for the Sav@@ ings of the Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ences do not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation where she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I do not believe it should rush ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
to prepare a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , too , there are a number of people who support non @-@ profit asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
even with her 74 l@@ ences she still likes to teach .
every Thursday they do it in the asylum seek@@ er at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
there they help refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan learn the German language .
of course , it &apos;s a different lesson than at a real school .
Rio Grande P@@ edi@@ at@@ ric Company promotes nutrition for healthy breast feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS is trying to educ@@ ate women about how important good nutrition during breast@@ feeding is . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck at breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , a child &apos;s un@@ healthy diet can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction proposal for the 2.3 million euro @-@ expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar panels .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited workshop on the Bern@@ rie@@ der sports grounds is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent municipal council the elabor@@ ated construction proposal was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before , the committee had decided , among other things , an application for a civil &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resp@@ ecting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the valid building plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ m@@ ite first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be built . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems is the background of the planning : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , we get a wonderfully large southern roof together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the &quot; Liber@@ ation , &quot; it was again about an a@@ version that should be under ten degrees for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for roof til@@ ting does not allow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Gemein@@ der@@ at generally tends to be more restric@@ tive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the gymn@@ asi@@ um structure is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ atitude .
in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be presented to the Land@@ rats@@ amt for examination .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the district court , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , confirmed this .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board and conven@@ es on Wednesday , 23 September .
should the plans be implemented , then all of the 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue to work .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further internal station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who cannot cope with Sch@@ ong@@ au are to be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
employees are informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
when asked who should follow the succession , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the leadership from October 1 and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) specializes in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside station .
for the next two years , Fischer and his team are expected to conduct both houses until next year , the former hospital of the pop@@ lar , which still has 35 beds , should finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district has planned this for 2018 , if the current refur@@ bish@@ ment is completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital .
coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ours that the house , owned by the Federal Co@@ unc@@ ill@@ or , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I exclude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short term care for Car@@ itas and a daily stress clinic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the rel@@ ocation to the Le@@ ch , which was received by the employees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understandable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as head doctor for more than 30 years has not been given .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleague to take over the post of the medical director .
in the past decades , the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closure , departments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Lion is called for the Berg@@ ischen HC this evening ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) .
although the leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Wuppertal is the clear favourite , there is no reason for arro@@ gan@@ ce .
in the last season , the bad@@ ener moved into a painful defeat at Bh@@ c and made something good there .
hunting accident with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the ab@@ err@@ ence on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in action , as the police shared .
a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospital .
how exactly did the accident come about was unclear at first .
the C@@ ID is determined by the police .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a crime suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate which had been missing since Saturday .
in inter@@ ro@@ gation the 20 @-@ year @-@ old had to kill the young people and threw their cor@@ p@@ ses into a channel in rock @-@ breaks .
a 16 year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violent crimes .
the cor@@ p@@ se of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and police announced on Wednesday .
as a matter of fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old captured on Tuesday evening , who was indeed indic@@ ted and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home after attending an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
when searching for a young woman , investig@@ ators first encountered the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
when inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing people finally resulted in a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the arrested police had to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ p@@ ses into the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a burden on him .
further investigations are to be carried out on the near@@ er circumstances of the act .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing disasters
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a paid stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing development is faced with a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the arriving refugees and j@@ ob@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing Building &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units will be completed in Germany this year .
this means 14@@ 0,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an emergency shelter .
many then come across the housing market and enter the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers were used for rent last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to rising numbers of refugees .
the study also makes considerable om@@ is@@ sions in housing policy in recent years .
Germany is shooting a public deficit that will grow from year to year .
currently some 77@@ 0,000 units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compl@@ ains Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore stayed in large cities with no necessity in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults were un@@ willing to stay in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for longer because of the noisy on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per head has sun@@ k for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggests a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to revi@@ ve new incentives for social housing .
so the property tax could be wai@@ ved and the property tax is temporarily suspended for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats .
furthermore , attractive tax amor@@ tis@@ ation opportunities are necessary , according to the alliance .
the subsi@@ dy programme for the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available EUR 300 million had already been accessed on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
after Hungary there is practically no going through , as more and more refugees are choosing the way of Croatia .
Zagreb announces to pass through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia by establishing a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Minister of the Interior , and if necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the aboli@@ tion of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television broad@@ ca@@ ster RT@@ L reported .
Hungary had closed its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , also make regular asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can go through , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police picked up the first refugees at Serbia &apos;s border with Croatia in the morning .
most of the media reports originated from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus as well as taxis in the Ser@@ b border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to get to Croatia on foot .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border the refugees do not come across borders .
for this reason the border strip bears other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 90@@ s .
mine clear@@ ers are expected to quickly create a safe passage .
after Hungary , hardly any more refugees arrive after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police counted 3@@ 66 challenged people .
shortly before the closing date on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws make it possible to overcome and damage the border fence as a criminal off@@ ence .
35 criminal proceedings were thus initiated in the border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed in the southern Hungary .
the condemned thre@@ aten prison sentences of up to five years and exp@@ ul@@ sion from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; transit zones &quot; set up on the border , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important crossing of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
there are 13 families with small children and two older people among the applicants .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
practically nobody has a view to get granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up with it .
they collected garbage that tens of thousands of people left in the road@@ side in recent weeks .
the barriers were disman@@ tled and one of the record stores in the border town was rebuilt .
no one wanted to sell himself to the goal of this reconstruction .
after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary , only a few refugees arrive .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants still remained in the country according to government information .
about 1400 people in Salzburg are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly .
mayor drove &quot; ge@@ str@@ and@@ ete &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Brück@@ en@@ fest on Sunday we were busy with the ti@@ dy , when suddenly ten people were standing with travel dec@@ aff@@ s at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly adapted the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , because of the flow of refugees with Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and marked the border along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we had recently cal@@ med the unexpected guests with snacks and drinks .
we just said we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; it was a matter of course for us , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N interview .
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t let it take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from ICE to a regional train in W@@ els on Sunday evening in a regional train in direction of Passa@@ u in order to try the railway traffic to Germany , but still to try the border .
however , the regional train was shut down in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , day before a two @-@ bridge @-@ race spor@@ tily - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein und Bavaria aus Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has sent tens of thousands to us now is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping at the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor lifted the position of the Hungarian government into the ha@@ ze circle of National Socialism .
those Austri@@ ans are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now facing chao@@ tic states in the border areas .
even the refugees will have to notice that the &quot; promised land , &quot; which they have invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing flood of refugees and approaching winter , to make decent conditions for vulnerable people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad looking for 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ proof quarters
Konrad has to do all his hands with the placement of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
the government has deployed the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to raise lod@@ g@@ ings for the thousands of refugees .
Konrad already got a grip on the chaos in the first tak@@ eover centre in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the lodging of the 20,000 refugees that had come to Austria on Monday was without major f@@ uss , said Konrad , and praised the organizational &quot; master power . &quot;
on the other hand , the Interior Ministry spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad counts on a demand of 85@@ ,000 Quar@@ ters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5.000 units must be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a drum without a floor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the governor .
they would have assured him to create neighbour@@ hoods for the coming refugees .
&quot; things are going well in Upper Austria , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier .
former VP @-@ Mand@@ atory supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , to clarify how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Asyl@@ um Co@@ ordin@@ ator also has great expectations in the ORF &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for placing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it cannot be that district employers have to respect a certain amount of the towel rail or the size of the overhead .
for a temporary period of time , &quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to apply .
Konrad explained with his experience that he was more successful in contrast to the Interior Ministry in the accommodation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gent@@ leman , who cannot be seen without further into the face of un@@ truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the power of persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not inc@@ ur any costs to the Republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees at three to four .
up to now , the own search for lod@@ g@@ ings has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as the Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at present , as the parties concerned can currently do without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of emer@@ gen@@ cies , other sites are to be tested for their suitability .
the city chief critic@@ ises the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also contribute to this .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) added further action in the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the continued journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being .
the guards would , however , be brought to Germany using regular trains .
from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue .
the fact that Austria is now introducing regular checks on its borders is a logical consequence for P@@ ühr@@ inger , &quot; out of the proceedings of the Germans .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the industrial line Lin@@ zer is officially closed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in startup companies in the New ship@@ yard , and later also acquiring them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - from what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
€ 1.7 million was invested by S &amp; T in the site , € 3.3 million from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of residual surface in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are en@@ quiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second store in the ar@@ cade
in the new shop Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the focus .
actually J@@ utta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ ar@@ cade : after all , she has now grown in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and garments from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around Dam@@ ian hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are starting from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
before that , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I &apos;ve been thinking long if I want to open a store , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor in the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of an own location in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the greater area of Linz who sell this stamp , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who himself has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Br@@ eit gave her fashion @-@ interest in the cra@@ dle from her mother .
most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why some women encounter a beautiful hand@@ bag at the sight of a hand@@ bag , the professional woman can &apos;t answer with the latest security .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag hon@@ ors every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose residents are called initi@@ ators .
this property also connects many with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for upright .
whether he is alien@@ ating from x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , repor@@ ters or revealing knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US Pres@@ idency inspir@@ es the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cut it off well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the fo@@ eh@@ n hair@@ style is a term for many in the wine village on the wine route .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ town is related to it over -@@ tens corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del shot a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it exciting somehow , but they are not so deeply impressed by their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; Sim@@ one Wen@@ del says .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the town and its famous offspring , which besides Tr@@ ump is also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , is also a word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was in a circum@@ ference , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to High German : the initi@@ ator , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump thus comes from the village of the don@@ ors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a place for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundation stone of the real estate company was the first real estate sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed at the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged then .
he did not pick up Tr@@ ump because he was once without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and People &apos;s Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , explained the start of the film .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an illegal emig@@ rant .
this contrasts with the occasionally striking statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly spoken out about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a boundary wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement sees the American rather dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so five thousand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension @-@ host@@ ess Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm is mentioned as many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the family Heinz came to an end something for the church organ , which was generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you find it better if he won &apos;t give the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if those who had been sa@@ wing in the United States during his grandfather &apos;s time would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ t@@ cher Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe even without the president . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 movie singers , also in the USA is awakening interest .
the Upper Bavarian community Ram@@ sau with Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for Sustainable Tourism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in neighbouring countries , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must have a maximum of 2,500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as protected area .
seven &apos;s sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite N@@ ine &apos;s attempts to take over the loss of leadership at Today &apos;s Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hurry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report after the loss of the leader of the liber@@ als , but it did not have any major shifts in the reviews for Today .
N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the Federal Capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull created the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Ri@@ val Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Niag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the crash didn &apos;t seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers , since sunrise provided an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 viewers with the five capitals , compared to today &apos;s 3@@ 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today posted a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number lag@@ ged behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today has closed the gap with Sunrise in recent months .
in August 2014 it reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 .
up to now in September , sunrise at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 viewers at Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these li@@ ais@@ ons more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics had wonder@@ ed if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the ra@@ fting star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor by Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and slightly hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening at two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half @-@ hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new quiz show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e , revealed on average 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires hot @-@ se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour , 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of The Ch@@ ase Australia &apos;s second evening will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ seed will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that it did not manage to over@@ take Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s show .

the final three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secrets un@@ veiled ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have probably un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , who finally landed at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was envel@@ op@@ ed in sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows the day before coming out of three two , you might accidentally give an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood firmly shut his lips to the final on Thursday
all three women have had a ly@@ rical way out why Wood is the perfect man and they called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , when asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods final rose ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be their answers to the per@@ ni@@ b@@ ulation who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki knew both quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies noted , I felt that they were pretty compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited for a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made her clear that Wood would be &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly set on him , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked whom Wood would choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30 pm .
originally released as Sarah &apos;s first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a fight as he did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ts on Tuesday with his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a confi@@ ded to his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a Pun@@ t @-@ Return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by Team Co@@ ordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his embarrass@@ ed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t that was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it certainly wasn &apos;t the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian band had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut at the time in 2007 when a pass was leading in his own in @-@ go@@ al area to a t@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free voters are calling for the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Day in Groß@@ eber@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools if there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 extra teachers to protect schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ van@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free Elec@@ torate will conv@@ ene until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e .
actually quite different main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free Elec@@ torate @-@ Meeting .
&quot; of course , the subject asylum will overlay the exam , &quot; said Ai@@ van@@ ger .
Ai@@ ev@@ anger demanded the establishment of UN Prot@@ ected Are@@ as for Refu@@ ge@@ es in Syria , as existed during the war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Elec@@ torate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one free voters as soon as possible .
therefore Ai@@ ev@@ anger also asked more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ van@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform federal standards across Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bayern moves off , others not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to become more responsive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy in large @-@ wall city should not fall under the table .
a lon@@ gla@@ sting long @-@ standing burner is on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , Mini@@ stries of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) at 47 grammar schools had started the pilot study &quot; middle school plus , &quot; in which an extension of the secondary school level of three to four years is tested - the result will then take nine years to the final exam again .
but Ai@@ ev@@ anger is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 has to be accelerated &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all high schools who want to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
free ride at G@@ 9 wherever it is desired .
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax jump on jumps
the German stock market has closed with profits by way of long stretches of direction @-@ free and nervous tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tory .
only in the afternoon was a clear start of the US stock markets for a clear direction , which ultimately bore the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points .
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized value won 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points .

solid profits also earned premi@@ ums in London and Paris .
in the United States , the D@@ ow Jones Index has recently recorded some 1 percent in plus .
many c@@ ail@@ le@@ ans expect the markets to appear on the spot even after the interest rate decision in the US and to the large decline on the fut@@ ures markets .
the debate on the burdens arising from nuclear phase @-@ out has temporarily pushed the RW@@ E shares to a record low and left its mark on E@@ on .
according to Spiegel Magazine , the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros in provisions .
the federal government denied the numbers mentioned in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon shares increased by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the D@@ ax peak .
according to a retail@@ er , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; had a positive effect from the weekend .

investments in future @-@ oriented wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .
auto@@ graph@@ s were in demand : even in the traditionally low summer months of August more cars were set off than in the same period of the previous year , as announced by the Industry Association AC@@ EA at the launch of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .
the documents from the Daimler and BMW automobile manufacturers increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .

killed 4 people after police shot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mand@@ u .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior civil servant , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside of a police station , with some of you throwing stones and incen@@ diary bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used tear gas and then shot in the air before they res@@ or@@ ted on rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , known to be able to kill , but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the conflict was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ ri@@ ans say that new provinces , formed in the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal by the ethnic group of Th@@ arus that want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been governed for centuries centrally .
work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted in Kath@@ mand@@ u on certain cl@@ auses this week , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Old Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 m2 area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are still no concrete offers .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den intends to market an area of approximately 4000 square meters in direct proximity to the Youth Centre Old Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the premises for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
one is waiting for appropriate offers , it is said on the part of the city .
which investor to issue is not yet clear .
according to this , no contracts were signed .
the town of Em@@ den had already bought a part of the property , which is located at the Ring@@ straße / corner Große Straße , already a few months ago and the buildings on it can be torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
plans for the holiday settlement at the Little Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
for the first time , the investor has publicly announced plans for the project .
several residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure facility
for months the doors were locked , tor@@ tured , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new vacation settlement on the Little Sea near Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the mid @-@ sized Em@@ de Company &quot; System Building , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Em@@ de Council &apos;s urban development committee .
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , which accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ mann went from System @-@ Building Management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet responded to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ours now .
ten to twelve million euros of expensive projects have been in the discussion for months .
the pictures and new details about the required hotel building arous@@ ed severe reactions among land@@ lords who had come to the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , a sal@@ es@@ man and member of the Board of Directors at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this becomes a giant ring that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like several other project critics , that traffic would increase sharply due to the planned size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whole bus loads must come for that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what is happening on the good one hectare site of the former restaurant is still open .
there is still no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the construction plans are still variable .

Google starts dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announc@@ ing the donations call on its blog .
instead of making the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google agent who had fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , had her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark rail and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : physicians without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to goo@@ gle@@ .com / de@@ posit@@ ory to $ 11 million .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

for overweight di@@ abe@@ tics weight loss surgery can be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those receiving non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mortality data takes a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial about the new J@@ AM@@ A Surgery study .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity treatments have proven to be efficient for type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with BM@@ I above 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ v@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data collected in a study since 2007 compare two types of obesity - stomach b@@ ypass and stomach ul@@ cer@@ ation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I of those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among those undergoing surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes condition was completely and at 28 % partially .
in the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes was completely reduced to only one percent , and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results of blood pressure controls , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol in general were better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by some 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , said Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results of the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had more weight compared to the host tom@@ ie group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3,@@ 1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and showed rather a complete overcoming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of severely disabled people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , obes@@ e people who underwent O@@ bes@@ ity surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patient , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , without the risk of death or kidney disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the Hun@@ sr@@ ück
it is a topic that is becoming increasingly noticed in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly at school times , meets the flock of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting especially for Hun@@ sr@@ ück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and the surrounding villages .
the main @-@ time author was raised in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and is pleased that she was able to place a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader appe@@ aled to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his 10 @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also pointed out that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the engagement of the Dalai Lama in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caring for several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we must think about how the killing is dimin@@ ished in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never resolved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and turned out that the violent reaction of the US drag@@ ged a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he created violence and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase of intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
poison control centers in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age who swal@@ low up alcoholic hand dis@@ infection products , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of hand dis@@ infection in children under 12 years of age who report to poison control centers rose from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them land in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children can drink dis@@ infection products while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test of courage in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young@@ sters are drinking dis@@ infection products only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have re@@ port@@ edly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of the disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think it &apos;s bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing to children .
hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few sy@@ ring@@ es can cause alcohol pois@@ oning especially in small children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison center hospital at K@@ ans@@ as University , the Fox 4 in K@@ HAN@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it then it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes of after straw@@ berry and disinf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought to an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which was legally considered drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ul@@ led her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors watched them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had pushed the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ y@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ infection books and store hands disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contains meth@@ anol , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ishes them out of their room .
the police regarded the s@@ worn plot as &quot; talk &quot; and pointed out disciplinary action to the school authority .
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
in the case of a rear @-@ end collision at the cross@@ bar between Nordr@@ ing and Auf Den , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver was easily injured .
a 60 @-@ year old truck driver drove towards the industrial area on the lateral bra@@ ces and realised too late that two preceding vehicles had stopped at the round@@ about .
as a result , he colli@@ ded with his truck to the rear of an audi@@ tor and pushed this vehicle to a previous Ford Fi@@ esta .
the accident involving the accident victims was about 10,000 euros , the police said .
the Audi of the 33 year old was no longer willing to travel and had to be tow@@ ed .

lack of title competition in Scottish football boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers out there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , presently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they don &apos;t show highlights of the Cel@@ tic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here do not just talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what interests them .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted Cel@@ tic to fight , but the Norwegian chief v@@ owed to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent ex@@ cre@@ tion from the Champions League , the defeat was followed by 10 @-@ man in Aber@@ deen , which now has five points ahead clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dei@@ à said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that just like that - but we have to go on .
we really need to really support Cel@@ tic because that makes the players better .
getting together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton careful with January transfers

the players coming in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it increases overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of the 5.5 percent of the U@@ K@@ s , as the figures of the National Statisti@@ cal Office ( O@@ NS ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland grew by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland grew to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; state Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland had made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I &apos;m witness@@ ing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later , except for late legal intervention , I will see a man being brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the po@@ ison@@ ous sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications than places available , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery is taking place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media spaces from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will be sitting next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps , closest to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps , with whom I developed my own relationship over the course of the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed me to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have formulated better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ yar@@ n , a repor@@ ter at the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go down here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective , I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after hum@@ id police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he persu@@ aded the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang up the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer attempting to &quot; gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale police were called on Tuesday for a breakdown of house peace in Becken@@ ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them towards the Cann@@ ing River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , cous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to escape from alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and thre@@ aten to quit racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims racing Victoria &apos;s ste@@ wards tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he focused on the ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ ity Division of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt tu@@ g@@ gling test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alleg@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like over@@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I pre@@ tended to say nothing , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with it what I have said .
tonight I will go home and sleep well .
I want to walk around the head raised and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be more trainers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had let Bom@@ b go up in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man whom I will call when I am asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I &apos;m doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if this is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed to try to hold me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should it bring me to the point that it is personal ?
did the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I &apos;m there .
perhaps they have to take away my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now letting them think about it .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration level was based on Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt study , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led him to &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , declared the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack had been applied mud or clay to the horse &apos;s debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my collabor@@ ators has mistakenly put mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
but it was also the same on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes back ri@@ vals due to alleg@@ ations to ring struggling
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critici@@ zed the tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as &quot; Agenda setting &quot; by two Premier League favorites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the judges allowed the storm players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a hardly concealed comment on the Storm Team after his team scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in w@@ rest@@ ling .
at Tac@@ kl@@ ing , Bell@@ amy defended his team and said that they were only focused on their &quot; contact &quot; at the Tac@@ kl@@ ing .
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading coaches on his team was speaking optim@@ istically as it was worried that they were worried about being struck by the Storm Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows up again and again - I haven &apos;t heard Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but over the last six weeks we have made our contact at Tac@@ kl@@ es a real center of gravity , and this has provided us with the trend revers@@ al .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not used to losing it so it was a bit shock for him .
it is funny as this shows up again and again at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was being critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he would take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play like them .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm played a higher result against R@@ oo@@ sters than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points a thing exciting ?
for me , it &apos;s the maps .
when they mention us , it means that in a phase we will still meet them .
the Storm Team released this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday night in the Pre @-@ fin@@ als at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee on Drug Ad@@ diction
a man who may face a lifetime penalty due to his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and landed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants at the marina in the course of the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly life @-@ like penalty for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the entire crowd and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared to the Court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs &apos;s mother and step@@ father had jointly offered a $ 200,000 security deposit in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it statements of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail under the conditions that he dis@@ covers his austr@@ ali@@ an and his Serbian passport , reports to the police every day and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab ri@@ ps apart
on Tuesday evening , a truck driver had been seriously injured during a rear @-@ vehicle collision with three trucks on the expres@@ s@@ way 5 near Karlsruhe .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent building site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to devi@@ ate to the left at the last moment , as the police shared .
the driver &apos;s cab of the crash site broke apart completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely blocked for six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
the result was a damage of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone from girls to l@@ ure ped@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when she slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of this and looked at the five pictures , then analyzed computers found at the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches that used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he had done it as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the Internet , &quot; and then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it was a ad@@ diction , that he was addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches on the computer were done by him , but he said it had happened because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
after his talks he was asked with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said that he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confron@@ ting the def@@ end@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the def@@ end@@ ant used computers and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment , to have in@@ decent images of children on 14 June of last year , to have viol@@ ated the conditions and did not appear before the Court on 24 March of this year .
defense attorney Greg@@ or S@@ im requested H@@ og@@ g to not appear in the Registry of sexual offen@@ ders since one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to obtain background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted security deposit in this case but was rem@@ anded in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was included in the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
tractors devi@@ ate from small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up outside the main control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
in fear of discovery and arrest , many bad @-@ users propag@@ ated the people at smaller border cross@@ ings .
out of the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the Federal Police said .
since Tuesday , more than 1000 refugees have been picked up along the river Inn river Inn in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they had reached the German side by foot over bridges and dam@@ s .
there they are welcomed by Federal Police officers and forwarded to the registration .
in comparison to the start of the week on Wednesday , more clearly more refugees arrived at the Munich Central Station .
around 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 hours , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re @-@ establishment of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : a for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologists warn of storms in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
because of a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
the vigor@@ ous low was the foo@@ th@@ ill of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; who was drag@@ ged over the Atlantic Ocean from the Bermuda Islands over the past few days .
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected , above all , in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , the Black Forest , Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and the Lake District have 60 to 90 kilometres per hour to calculate .
the sun can therefore be seen again on Friday .
the crowd makes it : every two years , the manufacturers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
in 2015 , it is above all moving to the compact cars that are currently particularly well @-@ selling .
cars from the compact class are currently in great demand : approximately 28@@ ,@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the Federal Office of the Federal Railway Authority ( KBA ) in August alone in this segment .
this is also reflected at the International Motor Show ( Publi@@ shed 17 to 27 September ) .
many new compact models will be introduced this year between all the futur@@ istic concepts and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in the fall .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
so that the volume model is sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Opel makes an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs 4.@@ 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with a capacity of 74 kW / 100 hp .
furthermore , the Hessen offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , including three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time .
unlike the major competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as a fifth @-@ door .
the second version will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which can be seen at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA and new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a fifth @-@ door in a conventional and a sporty GT @-@ version .
he comes to the trade at the beginning of next year , and then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan un@@ loader wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines adapts perfectly to the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
in addition , there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 Nm ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
sales launch of Bal@@ eno in Europe in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n shelf placed first @-@ hand on the front : the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otainment system was modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and integrated with Apple Car@@ Play for the first time .
in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the open Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are deser@@ ted
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ prisoner to the prison @-@ prison Te@@ gel , who was imprisoned for months in a small cell .
because of the violation of their human dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees are basically entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
the victims , according to the judges , can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was now on the open foot , had been transferred to a larger cell .
his position in office due to the un@@ worthy conditions of detention for the State of Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges rev@@ oked the judgment of the Chamber of Appe@@ als in Berlin and re@@ affir@@ med the case for re@@ viewing it .
they see man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber Court decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons , only a few days of rest days were decisive for compensation , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cur@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of the personality would be afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber court must now clarify the amount of cash compensation .
in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of law .
in April of a prisoner , they said that he was naked in a prison cell .
human un@@ worthy is a 2011 decision as well as the multiple occupation of a cell without separate toilet .
moreover , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 for decent housing .
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff was lod@@ ged for three months between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Car@@ ls@@ bad case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines because of missing personnel .
prisoners are therefore always locked up for 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even th@@ ras@@ hes should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the judicial authorities , 21 jobs in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to lack of young talent , 19 are to fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany ?
according to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800@@ ,000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts of 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are used annually - the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has ever been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but especially in affordable rental properties : annually , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing comes out of the rental price relationship , and in order to apply these particularly favorable homes , refugees will also apply .
the Federal Minister of Education Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
this is far too little from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing a year would have to arise and therefore the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
scientists and Federal Minister of Economics agree that there will also be more tax benefits for investment in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research ( Institut für Arbeitsmarkt@@ - und Berufs@@ forschung , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the birds in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for Integration and Education , critic@@ ises the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial whether they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission company , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ es@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ es@@ hardt , there has been a political turn@@ around : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise work .
whereas previously there was a prohibition of work for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence obligation to restrict asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society - also because of the lack of skilled labour - there has been a majority of points of view that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market faster .
a major obstacle to access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
to date , there is still no adequate supply of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs most often are im@@ par@@ ted through personal contact .
the construction of networks is therefore , according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt , the royal road for the integration of work .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children to the care centres , an estimated ten to 15 per cent : &quot; it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ atic , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for female educ@@ ators is increasing by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of training - for instance by allowing more specialised schools .
in the countries , students with no knowledge of German will be prepared for classes .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ones from Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk considers that approximately 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal state does not prohi@@ bit asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception has so far been Berlin , inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has given up his position now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; study @-@ willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a residence or divor@@ ce do not receive services according to the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s law more if they start studying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter do not get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since it does not fall under the circle of persons entitled to b@@ ypass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tolerated refugees have had to live in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 this can be shortened to 15 months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this financing gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and Deutsche Studenten@@ werk .
the students should get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively enter into Islam the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state @-@ church law will continue to develop into a new state @-@ religion relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
rights also include duties .
so the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and to give it certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take action against religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to au@@ gment such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism is more urgent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law since a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NS@@ U mur@@ ders showed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long been demanding and what international agreements like the anti@@ rac@@ ism convention commit to Germany must become a reality over the next few years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to use its opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees expected so far , says Chairman Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as man@@ - power and capacities are concerned , we do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all newcom@@ ers to sign health cards immediately .
achievements could later be calculated with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to cut off so many people with the limited range of services provided by the asylum seek@@ er performance law .
otherwise the doctors mainly do the language barriers .
even so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants become worse in their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , but also in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over , it demands .
many refugees , however , would have been helped with more general medical contacts in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities in refugee children , and young people are concerned with HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the partially different clinical pictures German doctors come from her training , but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis is not so difficult to recognise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and concerning the lack of doctors , even relief may be seen by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians had a highly developed education system , some refugees even were doctors .
in order to practise , however , they must prove their qualifications and possibly ex@@ ams ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to the Federal Psycho@@ therapy Association ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most people suffer from post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
refugees are particularly vulnerable , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee crisis is being traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who are suffering from post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder , among others , suffer from so @-@ called flash backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and fear of death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms being chronic , early treatment would be necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
to date , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees get psycho@@ therapy .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly psych@@ ologically ill people seeking asylum in the social offices can make an application for psycho@@ therapy , but the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , mostly cler@@ ks or doctors who are not trained for the psychological illness will decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
ring invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new st@@ aging &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to draw every age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst in the arena invites you to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior chef .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current management of the management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years the Circus is in the hands of the Pro@@ bst .
so the gift to the fan@@ atics lies in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to get people away from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Junior Company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; food cocktail with a world city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus Programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family draws attention to the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies it wants to easily take up the Cuban du@@ et .
ease and ag@@ ility - with these words , they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art on the mast is supposed to conquer female hearts by storm .
besides numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst will also fascin@@ ate with dex@@ ter@@ ity and artic@@ ulation .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yuan .
snake men fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , like little others and fascin@@ ates with its flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst took a position : &quot; if our animals are not good , we are not doing well . &quot;
about 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged Arti@@ sten &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be read by the eyes as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
so the first commandment is good for the animals .
especially on their zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived together for eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is for sure , &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst said : &quot; no matter if five or 1,@@ 200 spectators , we always do our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst will invite you to your performances every day from 17 to 20 September .
on Sunday , the program begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is a family day , for the performance at 5@@ pm the prices are reduced .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open every day from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe Robert Mu@@ gabe finds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , dropped down the stairs from a podium in the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opening of the Parliament has also been clou@@ ded by claims by members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and warn them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen as well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past month , they had rested on him and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told journalists about Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it warns the members of Parliament that the immunity will end in parliament and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard won up to 30.000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30.000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts with the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service business activities .
the expected job cuts will lead to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will allow a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP chairman and Chief Executive , to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be focused on providing un@@ parall@@ eled , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard , to manufacture electro @-@ plants and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage one called &quot; the place of birth of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring in order to handle the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the belief that closely @-@ focused companies provide better performance .
FC Ar@@ senal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb , behind the wounded Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation works according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four matches for England , and in view of his story , his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as a few recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Premier inj@@ ections Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases by Wil@@ sh@@ ere six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Ar@@ senal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded most vulner@@ abilities .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have an accidental time period , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and win fight power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
Ar@@ senal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces himself a rotation in the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta might start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to take a little break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although ar@@ senal was clear favour@@ ites to advance through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest intim@@ id@@ ation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured by the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Ar@@ senal has drawn up the doctrine of the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the association to its first European ap@@ oc@@ o triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked out at Ar@@ senal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that gave us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the lack of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to the need for men to open themselves up , now even more desperate than ever before , such as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n against a pi@@ tiful life ) 2015 announced the year of the man with the aim of ques@@ tioning the culture that prevents men from searching for help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery would double .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication led through social media , with its focus on style about substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that is much deeper on our mental health .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was put on the head .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which gle@@ amed through the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers frequent hu@@ gs , moments when playing soccer in cozy arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it even though they often hold back to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the phone ministry I explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; My audi@@ tory role for people who feel de@@ pressed and suicide is really clearly shown to me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider &apos;s status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ fest this weekend with the totally re@@ designed backdrop to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent on Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to mal@@ low Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , Santa Maria Hel@@ ps and PS@@ G help to pass over to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game reports and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani took course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French champion to the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani reached a head office in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk , Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish master , since it is not only aiming for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the door . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out of the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause our opponents to create problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things we need to perfect over the course of the season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which last weekend could hold a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was ej@@ ected in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ inian wing storm was referred to as the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month , and he indicated why when he finished in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before joining Johan Wil@@ and beautifully into the long corner of the grid .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a big win , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , which Cel@@ tic beat in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field str@@ ung a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who went past Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they did not offer anything in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ments and bad conclusions , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was in the first half alone and then abandoned after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who turned Di Mary into a shot , which was driven by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ...
the second goal finally fell short after the hours @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an thus achieved his sixth round of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thought that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result down before substitute players E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi one goal was picked off at the end .
the coach from Malm@@ ö , age Har@@ ei@@ de later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have played only in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
qualifying games are not enough . &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core raises $ 2.5 billion through stock sales
the coal mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , resident in Switzerland , which is affected by falling commodity prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday by a stock sale as part of its huge debt redemption plan .
the company Gl@@ en@@ core , registered in London , stated in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion pounds to pay off their own debts .
the company , which lost 57 per cent of its market value this year , struggles with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn presses demand and is wre@@ aking ha@@ vo@@ c on markets .
the output of rights rights led Gl@@ en@@ cores Stock Corporation &apos;s stock exchange rate at the early Wednesday morning a rapid rise at the head of the London Stock Exchange .

X@@ av@@ i : pe@@ p Guardi@@ ola prevented switch from FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the Al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger , four times Champions League winner , twice world champion , twice World Champion , twice World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar .
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now betra@@ ys that he was already before the Euro 2008 before the departure from Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wants to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this also recorded the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to have a hu@@ stle and bu@@ stle . &quot;
in memory : in summer 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works for the German record champion : pe@@ p Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he got me with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s playing time in 2008 / 2009 would have gone with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the lawn , split the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s King triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown while discussing the variety and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night by HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the necessity of alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , do it with the cast of the film and not with the cast of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with offen@@ ded dis@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the comments from the actor of The Mar@@ tian strengthened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want people to think about - who will always be the director - how to deal with the character of Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a groove that is beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of Dear White People set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the directing right to the film ; Dam@@ on said their direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni squee@@ zed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; talks about the only black person in the room so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4.000 Li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement had a national impact and urged law @-@ makers and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured deposits .
in February the singer Prince gave an all@@ usion to the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Network is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ins who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depic@@ tion of the Catholic Church in the West .
it is unclear whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns the first champion
professional sports clim@@ ber and help guide Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which completed its 7th season , had never experienced a contest participant who could finish all levels of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the fin@@ als .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge in three seconds quicker , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to me ! News after the hard @-@ won victory , still under shock over the win of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than 10,000 $ , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how it is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first ended the course , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he gets the great sati@@ re .
I don &apos;t think he gets angry about it .
he has just been so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family man .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I &apos;m glad it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had exchanged roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been renewed for an eighth season , shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers s@@ ands past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins stream@@ lined a chance to climb within one half of Houston &apos;s Ast@@ ros game for the second American League game card .
for Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to capture over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintains his early offensive support , when Detroit points three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw at bul@@ l@@ bars any game , and therefore I want to go into the game completely .
the designated tiger @-@ hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first three hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle mar@@ in@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has swe@@ pt the pl@@ ywood well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ali@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( kick training ) , looked much better at the Bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back@@ yard at the end of the 7th Inn , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double at the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks scored a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ ck to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man he was faced with , in front of the design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run out of the right @-@ handed twist of Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the closing @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ monkey proposed a double play
after closing an Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth center , Berlin created a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed player , however , st@@ aked S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit benefited at the start of the game from a still not moving Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two in@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been removed from the injuries list before the game after he had missed more than one month due to a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I was wishing for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ B@@ atter on the first , he released a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up the middle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with runner in scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right hand , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , resulting in the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second one , achieved a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins Manager Paul Mol@@ it@@ or .
he did not beat very well , but he got the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the rel@@ ics right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z was eliminated because of a violation of the litter .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulnerable list because of a shoulder distortion , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP is painted by Daniel Mor@@ ris from the vulner@@ ability list to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing on the right hip joint since August 20th .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three matches in Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to come down in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on their way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people in it should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden te@@ amed up on Tuesday evening .
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this event in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stay there .
they are then to be further distributed to other communities .
over the past ten days , some 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse , responsible for the initial up@@ take of the government in Gie@@ ßen , have been on their own .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also have set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the decisive thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he repro@@ ached the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective fashion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago we were glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce had passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is crashing on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has again established controls on its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said on Tuesday evening in Austrian television broad@@ ca@@ ster ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s so arranged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement in which Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Director for Public Safety and the Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Germany .
they did not call them concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
during the last days tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
her goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , requested a special summit next week .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common procedure in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers plan to take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
in view of the strong refugee march in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the Federal Government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on late Tuesday evening after almost four hour discussions with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people who would need protection will receive it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but those who don &apos;t have a lead @-@ eye view cannot stay in Germany either .
this view was unanim@@ ously shared in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must be cop@@ ing with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck in the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest to tie up the border with Romania with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said about the planned new border fence . Hungary wanted to prevent the tu@@ g of ev@@ asive action about Romania , said Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witness accounts , thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
under the ice ar@@ mor@@ ant of Saturn &apos;s En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus , a global ocean sp@@ ends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what researchers conclude from observations of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the moon is therefore easily deceived by its orbit around the ring planets .
this movement of pi@@ geons is only small , but nevertheless too large for a continuous firm cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is written in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State of New York ) on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been known for some time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice @-@ volcan@@ oes at the south pole of Saturn &apos;s full moon in 2006 , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles and feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least on the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
the expansion of the hidden ocean has not been clari@@ fied .
R@@ ama missing in 1860 München for several weeks
the 1860 München must abst@@ ain from Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
an investigation revealed an ad@@ duction of ad@@ duc@@ tors from the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association announced .
at the beginning of the week , R@@ ama had lam@@ ented for pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is expected to be four weeks of break @-@ over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ald of loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports Director Nec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a uni@@ on@@ less professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 1960s , however , initially presented a defensive occup@@ ant .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was previously signed at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ability to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tor@@ h@@ unter Ru@@ bin O@@ ko@@ tie can return to team training next week after his conc@@ ussion .
already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is supposed to get into running training .
O@@ ko@@ tie was injured in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent clas@@ h on his head .
however , contrary to the first fears , he remained without a severe cens@@ orship .
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy and sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to their slim line are often dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ gos contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : they contain B vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support ey@@ esi@@ ght , immune system , and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasantly .
the peel color alone does not tell how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
of course they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go , however , also gives hear@@ ty dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the US parcel service UPS returns up to 9@@ 5000 aid for the Christmas business in the USA .
the company already started the recruitment of seasonal workers , UPS announced on Tuesday .
drivers are mostly looking for drivers .
last year , UPS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 hel@@ pers .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , F@@ ed@@ Ex and his rival F@@ ed@@ Ex have been taking precau@@ tions since last year in order to be prepared for the Christmas business .
in 2013 , delayed deliveries had submitted a harsh criticism to the parcel services .
first fo@@ eh@@ ement storm , then striking cold front
in the coming night the hair@@ dryers stop in the valleys of the north side of the fo@@ eh@@ n , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and night to Thursday the hair @-@ dryer partly blows through the fo@@ eh@@ igh @-@ valleys with storm @-@ strength .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area over the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west current .
on the north side of the Alps , the fo@@ eh@@ n falls through the valleys on Wednesday night .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows in the F@@ öhn@@ valleys with bows of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn can advance in places up to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and even hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my fo@@ eh@@ n provides for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the moisture starts to st@@ ow on the slope of the Alps .
here the rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in sum , some 100 litres of rain per square meter in the south of the Alps have to be expected in the next 48 hours , this after already large rainf@@ all over the last few days .
on Thursday morning the blow comes out , as a result a cold front rolls with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east over Switzerland .
together with the cold front the wind g@@ athers strongly to stor@@ my , and temperatures go back considerably .
the following days are in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it is sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees in the south .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Place in Rome .
in the presence of city president Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located right in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing scheme had been applied for by the work community of the Protestant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the City of Pop@@ es could often only live in obsc@@ urity their faith .
the square symbo@@ lically shows that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city back then as a perfect sin @-@ be@@ ak .
his negative impressions are likely to have encouraged him by histori@@ ans in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then introduced the division of the Oc@@ ci@@ dent Church with his theses against ab@@ sten@@ tion .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the crown of thorns ( gil@@ ded ) is one of the main works Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now been published with magnificent images .
at the beginning was the picture of Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motives .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but this is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , this can be quite dark .
for three years Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible @-@ project for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles that focus on topics like cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ therhood .
he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological focus as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its main focus on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt , and so into today , translated into &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current connections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original quote from Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 year old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 , and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the education already happened with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up to perhaps also apply to the Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to re@@ affir@@ m art in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of pic@@ torial worlds is characterized today by advertising , and that is loud .
symboli@@ sm is displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt would like the viewer to immer@@ se himself in the images , let them work , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; the picture is looking for its opposite . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
old did not pay attention to fully compreh@@ ending the Bible but also chosen the most important , mysterious subjects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it &apos;s about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a picture Bible was created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas paintings - is presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X railway lining
plans were made , companies were commissioned to model earth moun@@ ds for a circuit : a year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train it was over again .
failures in politics and administration cared for dr@@ uss , especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
thus looking up hill , looking for new place - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will take place in October , the first com@@ mon@@ er Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then it should be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further memorial break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work of the former indoor pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga was a clear sign on the weekend .
the soccer respon@@ ds to the current situation in Germany and ass@@ ures politics its help in tackl@@ ing the problems that arise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this the greatest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t concern me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every single person must be interested in getting this topic under control , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he intends to discuss the situation of refugees in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and may help .
but the decisive course must be the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung , we ensured that this programme will continue until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal states also support this program .
already on this weekend the 36 professional associations set a clear sign when they will carry on the left tri@@ cot instead of the otherwise usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) the print &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports director Ru@@ di Vö@@ ller ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a matter of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drama hit everyone , nobody can see away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football allies , no , we need to use our bla@@ sting force , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Quali@@ fication Game against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large collective work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was great that all 36 license agreements had started their own projects in their places .
it is just as magnificent that small and small clubs are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; that we spent is lived in football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this and next year , the association will be providing 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the German government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have also called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO losing an eye in case of an accident
according to several reports , the chief executive of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell to a water jar after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bled , impot@@ ent , and then tow@@ ed out onto the street - he told us this last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Plat@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full of SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can do something like this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s important to stand up once you &apos;ve fallen down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren spare pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except skir@@ mis@@ h ...

football : Bv@@ B without re@@ bus against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us have finally broken up in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the FK K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Re@@ us will be back at Le@@ verk@@ usen in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel on Sunday , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load of his pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his core position at the Re@@ us position .
this was the way he announced a change at the door@@ keeper &apos;s position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of chief secretary Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all European league games .
with a high probability , he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ sche statement by fellow player Re@@ us , that the final move for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , holds mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l understandable : &quot; so Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to play a pioneering role for Germany
according to the German government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the process of changing cars .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which included investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the br@@ ink of the International Motor Show IAA from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and provide less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also intends to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who also come together with industry representatives at the International Motor Show .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport stresses , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a quick way of switching to digital radio .
a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria is currently being tested for testing new technology .
in order for the driver to &quot; avoid additional liability risks , &quot; the federal government intends to review the legal framework conditions and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally for the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention that has so far only envis@@ aged man as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly assumes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , mobile vehicles on public roads are not to be expected until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
value added in the driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of passenger cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
but the Germans still look skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday , on behalf of the investig@@ ator Dek@@ ra , concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect to believe that 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents estimate up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after surve@@ ying the digital network Bit@@ kom only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could at least imagine 15 percent , 45 percent in traffic jams .
good every fourth person would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis
according to the current state of September 25 to October 4 , the Düsseldorf @-@ based Düsseldorf will only be able to open its doors .
the final decision shall be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to win the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ mann Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said individual European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the list of settlements in Ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also remembered the European Championships in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo also lack@@ ed and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the World Ran@@ king Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the British football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to the right leg .
at the Champions League play at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , the def@@ enders were met by a Tac@@ kl@@ ing by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after a long treatment .
the first diagnosis was diagnosed by Bas@@ tian P@@ ig &apos;s 20 @-@ year @-@ old fellow player .
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of a very big fashion show and a wax figures sculp@@ ted cabinet : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display mannequins which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who among other things became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was ble@@ ak before , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung ( Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung ) on 18 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition was a bit like death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made its way to Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the scar@@ c@@ ely over@@ sight of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed overall artwork for which much effort was carried out : to ori@@ ze the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have car@@ ded 14 tonnes of material .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special delic@@ acy : a leather trousers @-@ outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ atively fashionable Geh@@ versuche do by the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught fashion designing fashion by himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later on I bought them , of course .
he has not been able to pay the models for his first own show of fashion .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewels instead of sheer curtain - P@@ lau@@ dry tip as fashion niche
in the past it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered materials and tips were created in a large quantity for customers , which they worked on for example for blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en Freeroll .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early days of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt called some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and in regional costumes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vintage fashion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which leans on past styli@@ stic periods is an increasing order potential . &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already account for half of all orders .
To@@ wer@@ ick P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ der@@ ies together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
there are almost no longer private specialised shops and wholesale dealers .
our products hardly reach the customer on this road .
nowadays , the mass @-@ produced goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively sold via chains .
moreover , exports , currently to Russia and the United States , are weak@@ ening .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also seeks to score points through environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the embroi@@ dery bead in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch of the West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to oppose competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there arises a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the factories , which must first and foremost think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ invented the historic snow@@ ball tip .
at the same time , the machine ch@@ okes small spheres at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing master Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously I could not start anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ en tip - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and would like to have a mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
legends are not to be touched , but Disney also dar@@ es to take a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
however , according to the Entertainment Week@@ ly , it &apos;s not about a new movie , but rather a continuation , which takes place 20 years after the first film with the magical children &apos;s girl .
it &apos;s about the experiences of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the global economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins over 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director is already certain : ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to open the world wide for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy must open wider outside to promote growth , said President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping on Tuesday , a group tas@@ ked with steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote new start @-@ ups and promote reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new place for economic growth , &quot; said X@@ i .
the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
a negative list is drawn up after the statement , the sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments .
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs a major role to the market in the allocation of resources , guarantees a legally binding business environment and makes the market more open , said the statement .
the government will also lo@@ osen checks on the powers transferred to the companies and make sure that companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
in the context of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , other areas are opened for private investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;

EU wants to double the level of mercury in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish , thereby adding a significantly higher dose of the tox@@ in to consumers .
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which has a corresponding EU working paper , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full impact on pregnant women and small children , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish for &quot; economic policy reasons , &quot; are to be lifted from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ or @-@ fish are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury that , on the basis of the still valid limits , about 50 percent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ sal@@ able .
in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , wants to ag@@ grav@@ ate the limit values for other fish of currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reduction in cl@@ one is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dy distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that only helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly po@@ ison@@ ous to humans , which is particularly rich in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish through the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small quantities can cause damage to the nervous system particularly in the case of un@@ born damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health risk for the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written report from the Federal Ministry for the Environment , German coal @-@ fired power plants exp@@ el more than six tonnes of mercury per year , two thirds of total volume em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as the river Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanent and widespread &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year Europe @-@ wide warnings against mercury in fish have already been among the most frequent reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
