the community and the states appoint two arbit@@ rators , the organization also names two arbit@@ rators , and the four refer@@ ees appointed by the judges elect a fifth who pres@@ i@@ des .
if the Community and the States or the Organization shall not be appointed by two arbitr@@ ator within thirty days of the request , the Community or the Organization shall request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint the arbitr@@ ator .
the same procedure shall apply if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are competent and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbit@@ rators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding upon the organisation , the community and the states concerned .
a ) This Convention shall apply to non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the contract and shall be members of the community , in force , i ) if the respective state of the organization noti@@ fies that its procedures for the entry into force of this Convention are concluded and
( II ) If the community of the organization noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other on the request of one of the contracting parties to am@@ end this Convention .
B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States .
C ) The General Director immediately teaches all Member States of the organization from any change in this Convention .
a ) This Convention shall enter into force on the day the organization of the Community and States receives written notification that their procedures are concluded for entry into force .
B ) This Convention shall remain in force as long as the States Parties to the Con@@ tract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol together . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of the Section I .
the aim of the safety measures set out in this Convention is the timely discovery of the diver@@ gence of significant quantities of nuclear weapons by peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive bodies for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ r@@ ence by the risk of premature detection .
in order to reach the target defined in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a preventive measure of fundamental importance , f@@ ading with spatial interference and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical completion of the checks by the organisation is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone the quantity of material that has not been verified for a specified period of time is listed under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified gau@@ ges .
in carrying out their audit , the Organization after article 3 makes full use of the security system of the Community .
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Material in accordance with this Convention is based on a structure in material balance zones .
in applying their security measures , the Community of de procedures and measures will make use of the methods and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , envis@@ age how they are near@@ er determined and appropriate in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measuring system for as@@ cer@@ taining the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise derived core material and stock quantities ;
B ) evaluating the reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determining , testing and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) procedures for the evaluation of accumulation of un@@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system that indicates the core material stock and the changes in this inventory , including the input and output of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions which ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Method of reporting reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the safety measures under this agreement do not extend to material in mining or in ore preparation .
B ) if original or th@@ ori@@ um@@ ent material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described in C ) , the Community of the Organization shall notify the quantity and composition of the material provided it is not introduced for specifically non@@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves core material suitable for the composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ op@@ ia enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other safety measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The safety measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not subject to provisions , the recovery of nuclear material , which is subject to safety measures under this Convention , is temporarily not possible or desirable , the Organization and the Community consult each other about the use of appropriate safegu@@ ards .
B ) The safety measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the Organization and the Community recognise that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
on request of the Community , the organization liber@@ ates the following key material from the safety measures under this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material used in non @-@ nuclear activities after article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is above 80 % .
at the request of the Community , the organisation liber@@ ates core material which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this Convention , from these safegu@@ ards , provided that the entire amount of nuclear material liber@@ ated in the States at no time is at any time more than
a ) a total of one kilogram special p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multi@@ pl@@ ying its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of natural ur@@ an@@ ium , calcul@@ ates by multi@@ pl@@ ying its weight with the fi@@ v@@ ef@@ old square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
should liber@@ ated core material be processed or stored together with core material which is subject to the security measures under this Convention , precau@@ tions for the re @-@ application of the security measures are made on that material .
the Community meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements , which are necessary in the scope that is required for the successful and effective accompli@@ shment of the tasks of the Organization under this Convention , in detail how to apply the procedures laid down in the Convention .
the supplementary agreements can be expanded or amended without amend@@ ment of the Agreement between the Organization and the Community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the Organization , the Community and the States undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to come into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the Organization , the Community and the States .
on the basis of the initial report stated in Article 62 , the Organization shall establish a consolidated inventory of the whole , the security measures of this Convention in the states , regardless of its origin , and carry on this inventory as a result of the following reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States of Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other hand
the EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme set out at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is imp@@ eded by general resource transfer problems .
C ) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement , and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the middle links in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organization of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria laid down in this agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the term &quot; Special Dis@@ order account , &quot; which consists of funds which the Member States have contributed to the special interaction account ; this account is managed and used by the Organization as Administrator ( in this property the organization is referred to as &quot; Administrator &quot; in the following ) and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special interaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the fees are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest notes of the member state , which must be paid on request in the currency of the relevant state at the order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction accounts and to be deposited at the deposit office of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment is made in two inst@@ al@@ ments ( and i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or another between the EEC and the appointed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time agreed between the EEC and the Administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Any Member State may wish to make payments before the above mentioned dates .
in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes about proportion@@ ate conc@@ essions to cash or the Notes in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction and offset the special interaction account in an appropriate manner .
when granting this loan , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC :
III ) to the extent that international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without dis@@ agreement ; and
VII ) The extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each Lo@@ an Lo@@ an is used to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly @-@ paid development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) regardless of whether it belongs to the organisation &apos;s loan programme or not , according to the procedures and practices that apply , evaluated , approved and managed for the purpose of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement , named b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the transaction must not be used instead of the Bank or Organisation &apos;s Bank or Organisation , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of entry into force of this Agreement .
apart from paragraph 4 , special transactions are subject to the same terms and conditions that are generally applicable to the development loans granted by the organization ; they are thus ref@@ und@@ able in ten free years each in 50 years .
transaction Lo@@ ans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are re@@ payable in these currencies .
amounts for payment of this watch must be made directly to the organization that maintains it .
each Lo@@ an Lo@@ an is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator in which the origin of the funds is given in particular .
income from each loan contract can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or rendered i ) in a member state ; ii ) in developing countries , which may be members of the organization and that according to what the administrator set at the time of loan granted , recipient of a special transaction loan .
capital re@@ payments of a special transaction are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in the currency of a member state in the currency of a member state is to be transferred back as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned .
the car@@ et@@ aker teaches until full disclosure of all the optional loans to the EEC concerning the plans and programmes approved by the directors in preparation for the inspection by the directors .
during the time of payment of the special transaction , the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the EEC as a quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expenses made for this .
the Administrator conve@@ ys the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization , a detailed account of the transaction accounts with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organization on this account conclusion .
after full payment of the transaction &apos;s loan , the administrator of the EEC as soon as possible communic@@ ates a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the special transaction account .
the car@@ et@@ aker creates and performs appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special interaction account , the amounts paid out of the account recei@@ pts and the deposits paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States are evident .
the EEC and the Administr@@ ators work closely together to achieve the aims of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the full issue of the means of the special interaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas on the state of the special interaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special interaction characters , and on all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement has not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date which the EEC and the Organisation may agree , the agreement and all obligations arising there@@ from shall be due immediately .
if the total capital amount of all the special loans taken by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement is rep@@ aid and returned to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations arising there@@ from shall be termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural rules of each party .
the governments of the Member States are noti@@ fying the Sec@@ retariat General of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings concerned .
the General Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these noti@@ fications along with a notification of the proper approval of this agreement by the EEC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications during the organization .
this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each word being equally binding .
whereas the agreement in the form of a correspondence to am@@ end Annex A of the Protocol No 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Energy Community , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Federal Council &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large experimental facility , the J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) project , the construction and operation of a joint venture according to Section V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; Joint Company J@@ ET . &quot;
Switzerland has been working on research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years and is very familiar with the area concerned .
since extensive work has to be carried out until practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion , it is in the interest of the contracting parties to summar@@ ise their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary overl@@ aps and to accelerate their respective research work , which has gained a higher priority due to the energy crisis .
this agreement should enable any contracting party to take advantage of unnecessary over@@ lap by mer@@ ging its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the resources provided for both sides of research , i.@@ e . the cost @-@ effective electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction to achieve faster results .
to achieve the objective of the present Convention , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Annex I and II of this Agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss programme . &quot;
in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom programme ; it is extended or amended by the organs mentioned in Articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present Convention that may include new activities relevant for the Eur@@ atom programme .
every time the contracting parties accept a new program , this shall take place at the place of the programmes specified in App@@ endi@@ x I and II .
the Associ@@ ations provided in paragraph 1 shall be realised by : - Ap@@ propri@@ ate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;

- mutual right to access the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
as part of the objective of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project .
in view of the association agreement provided in Article 2 paragraph 1 of this Agreement , the contracting parties conclude an association agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those between the Commission and the States and companies or persons , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ate Organ@@ s , &quot; with regard to the realization of the Eur@@ atom programme .
with the same objective Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved in the time of the entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange . &quot;
with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of J@@ ET with the time of entry into force , whose constitution accepts it .
furthermore Eur@@ atom ensures that Switzerland can become a contracting partner of any contract , whose goal falls within the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom within the validity period of the present agreement .
the organs responsible for carrying out the Association provided in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the present Agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and the Association Agreement .
the association agreement shall include in particular the establishment of a steering committee , which is a member of the competent committee of the Commission and the Council of the Federation .
- to monitor the development of the research work and to direct the best possible results in line with the objectives of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connecting group established within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; VG . &quot;
the VG , which has the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters concerning the ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom programme , perc@@ ei@@ ves this task with regard to all research and development activities relating to this agreement .
in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and addresses their T * activities in the interests of the two contracting parties to the common target set out in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss programme as well as to the common target set forth in Article 1 of the present Convention , with consideration of the scientific and technological developments in the world .
in accordance with its Rules of Procedure , the VG ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives in the consulting groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme whenever the competent Swiss authorities request it .
the Advisory Group , which the VG research proposals make for the best possible scientific results to be granted for the Eur@@ atom programme , is the task of all research and development work on which it is referred to in this agreement .
in the committee of directors involved in the Eur@@ atom programme , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the participating laboratories .

a Swiss representative is entitled to take part in the meetings of all the coordin@@ ating committees used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme .
the coordin@@ ating committees , which disp@@ ose of appropriate proposals for the use of the resources , personnel as well as the knowledge and skills involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme , will carry out this task in the respective area with regard to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement .
the BA@@ F is a member of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country responsible for nuclear and energy research .
at the request of the Commission , the BA@@ F consul@@ ts the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and the possible changes in the execution as well as in the preparation of future programs and the determination of its overall scope , coordination and integration of national activities at Community level in the field of fusion .
the opinions of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Board of Directors , the Advisory Group and the Co@@ ordination Committ@@ ees have a consult@@ ative character .
the opinion of the VG on the foreg@@ o@@ ing actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the Committee of Directors in the field of personnel change .
the representatives of the two contracting parties have an effect on the work of all technical advisory bodies or all administrative bodies created for the purposes of the present agreement .
the Swiss financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom programme in accordance with this agreement is fixed annually to an amount that is deb@@ ated by Eur@@ atom at the cost of the Eur@@ atom programme in the same proportion as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland in the previous year .
regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution relates to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the joint venture as soon as this is established .
in addition , Switzerland will assign an amount to the J@@ ET , which is defined in accordance with the financial provisions of the Articles of Association of this Common Company .
the financial contribution , which Eur@@ atom provides for the financing of work in the context of the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange , is calculated on the same basis that is usually used to calculate Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the work carried out on the basis of the corresponding agreements .
the Commission will inform the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which amount is envis@@ aged for covering expenses within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme for the year concerned .
the Federal Council pays the fee due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .
the remaining payment mod@@ alities for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom in accordance with this article are laid down in Annex III of the present agreement .

before each decision on the adoption of a new Eur@@ atom programme , the contracting parties consult the organs of the present agreement in the articles 5 to 10 and article 16 .
any contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement at any time in compliance with a period of six months .
in the form of a correspondence to the amend@@ ment of the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation
in addition , in order to simplify the procedure for adapting tari@@ ff @-@ tari@@ ff names in case of renewed changes to the tari@@ ff tari@@ ff of one of the contracting parties in the future , it appears further to include an article 12 in the agreement .
I honor you to confirm the consent of the Community to these changes , and propose to you as an appointment for the entry into force 1 January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government to the above .
I honor you to confirm the receipt of your current letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you confirm me with your government &apos;s approval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the Mobili@@ zation of the Member States &apos; demands in the context of medium @-@ term financial assistance
the BI@@ S could close stand @-@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks submit a corresponding application .
the agreements may be closed up to the total amount of fee paid by the credi@@ tor &apos;s country , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invo@@ icing units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery location funds of the member states .
but even now , there are some conditions listed below , to which the BI@@ S would be ready .
with each Stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions without a total of five years .
the BI@@ S would charge a loan application fee for the opening of the credits as well as for its event@@ ual extension .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first drawing dies will not be made prior to exp@@ ir@@ ation of one month after completion of the Stand@@ by Agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the drawing would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the end of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods of time taking into account the means of the bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those applying the BI@@ S at the time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would correspond largely to market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S has to proc@@ ure the required resources on the market itself , then the interest rate coming to the application could reach a maximum which corresponds to the margin increased by a corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would like to express my consent to the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could close stand @-@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks submit a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I honor you to express the consent of the Council of the European Communities to the content of this letter .

whereas for the Member States of the European Economic Community the obligation to grant this release shall fall into the jurisdiction of the Community , which according to the Treaty by which it was established , possesses the required powers ;
whereas it is necessary to carry out Article 5 ( 1 ) of the Convention that the European Economic Community can become a contracting party of the Convention -
the Convention enters into force on the first day of the month following signature .
on the first day of the month it will be held in force following the day when the last of the contracting parties deposited its acceptance certificate with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe .
( 2 ) How@@ ever , this Additional Protocol enters into force after the exp@@ iry of two years after the date of acceptance , provided that not one of the contracting parties has notified a obj@@ ection to its entry into force .
from that point on , a state cannot become a contracting party of the Convention , without becoming a contracting party of the Additional Protocol .
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the Member States of the Council of Europe , all States and the European Economic Community any acceptance or obj@@ ection under Article 2 , as well as the date of entry into force of this additional protocol according to Article 2 .
the Secretary @-@ General shall also note any action , notification or communication related to this Convention .
whereas Member States support each other in the spirit of European solidarity in the procurement of re@@ agents for blood group determination , it is highly desirable .
whereas these reci@@ pro@@ cal support is only possible when the quality and use of these re@@ agents for blood group determination is jointly submitted by the Member States and the necessary facil@@ itation and exemp@@ tions are granted for their import@@ ation -
in the sense of this agreement , the term &quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination &quot; means re@@ agents of human , animal , plant and other origin for blood group determination and to determine blood in@@ compati@@ bilities .
any contracting party may limit the application of this Convention on re@@ agents of human origin to the determination of blood group determination by signing this Convention or in the Sett@@ lement of its rati@@ fication , approval or accession by a statement addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe .
the declaration may be withdrawn at any time by a notification addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe .
the contracting parties undertake to leave re@@ agents for blood group determination to determine the costs of their extraction , preparation and transport as well as the purchase price of other contractual parties , which are in urgent need of them , provided that they themselves have sufficient supplies for their own needs .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are made available to other contracting parties only under the condition that no profit is associated with it , that they are only used for medical purposes and only designated by the authorities involved .
each shipment of re@@ agents to determine blood group identification must be accompanied by a certificate stating that they were produced according to the protocol .
the protocol and its establishment constitute an administrative arrangement that may be amended or supplemented by the governments of the Parties to this Convention .

any member who signs or appro@@ ves or appro@@ ves this agreement without prior reservation of rati@@ fication or approval , shall enter into force a month after its signature or deposit of the rati@@ fication or approval certificate .
after the entry into force of this Convention , the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe may invite any non @-@ member state to join the Convention .
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the members of the Council and the Coun@@ tries ( a ) at the time of the entry into force of this Convention and the names of the members who have signed or rati@@ fied or rati@@ fied it without any reservation of rati@@ fication or approval ;
any contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement with the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe in compliance with a period of one year .
a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or any other substance given on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) here@@ tical properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be examined for double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively by volume of the blood @-@ body flus@@ hing in the total volume .
in anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has defined international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination International standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are elabor@@ ated at the time .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ter , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in an er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter den@@ otes the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which international standard preparations are present ( anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B and Anti @-@ B ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent compared to the international standard preparation or a state standard preparation in international units ( see Bulletin of O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B S@@ eren are contained in the definition 256 International Units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institut , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparative tr@@ ation of the International standard serum Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall be maintained for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to the label is at most a year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date indicated on the label for dry re@@ agents is based on the results of shelf @-@ life trials ; it is approved by the state regul@@ ators .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and that is closed so that no moisture can enter .
a dry re@@ agent may lose a maximum of 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxi@@ des in a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent governmental authority can determine that a anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic is added to the re@@ agent ( or the solution supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein Nit@@ rogen per ml of flu@@ ffy or re @-@ dissolved serum .
the re@@ agents , regardless of whether in liquid form or after replacement , must be transparent and must not contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
as far as possible , the re@@ agents used for the international exchange of blood group determination should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally coloured , at least until an International Convention on a uniform system has been established .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent located in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the amount located in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all levels of production and controls of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
adequate samples of all re@@ agents must be stored for a long time from the laboratory , until some lik@@ el@@ ihood is assumed that the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for blood group identification can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective part into three groups .
this does not mean that re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents can contain no substances of human origin .
each individual container is a black and white printed label in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re@@ plen@@ ishing ,
furthermore , the label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instruction attached to the containers contains the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3. the quantity or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re@@ plen@@ ishing ,
each shipment must be accompanied by a certificate according to Article 4 of the Convention in accordance with the Annex to this Protocol .
anti @-@ A serum is obtained from the blood of selected individuals in group B , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific substances of the group A .

furthermore , it is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding equivalent of a leak@@ age of B @-@ blood cells to ti@@ ter .
the effectiveness of the serum may in no case be less than 64 international units per milli@@ litre .
un@@ dil@@ uted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( Group 0 ) blood serum must also produce an easily recognizable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the A@@ x ( A@@ x or A@@ o ) blood cells .
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent floo@@ ding of A1 and A2 blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double period required if the same tests are performed with the again dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or with a standard preparation of the same activity .

anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera of each specific@@ ity can be one of two types , which differ by the conditions under which an ag@@ glut@@ ination of hom@@ olo@@ id blood cells is reached .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with others described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ completely &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved with presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as cattle alb@@ um@@ in or by other special methods . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following requirements for Ser@@ a &apos;s effectiveness to determine the R@@ h group may be changed if international standard prepar@@ ations@@ . i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people immun@@ ised by an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 in comparison to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution .
a &quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the Anti @-@ rheum@@ atism ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) serum or equivalent comparison of C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells .
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the serum should react according to the possibility of blood cells containing do @-@ an@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which is intended to use object carriers in accordance with the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people immun@@ ised by ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with floods of human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but do not contain human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen .
these Ser@@ a are therefore specific to the C @-@ An@@ tigen when the tested blood cells are washed in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution .

the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies need to be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions set by the manufacturer .
if a serum for use on object carriers is determined in accordance with the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , the ag@@ glut@@ ination period for all types of red blood cells that show a reaction is not to be inferior to the proportion@@ ate antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of animals , which can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A .
anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells that contain A an@@ tigen , that is those of the blood groups A and AB including sub @-@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2B ; it ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates no human red blood cells that do not contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , that is those of the blood groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum is , parallel to the resur@@ rec@@ ted but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or equivalent comparison , separated with in@@ undation by A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B red blood cells ( 1 ) .
if anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % in@@ undation of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B @-@ blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double period required if the same experiment is carried out with the re @-@ dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity .

anti @-@ B Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells , which contain B an@@ tigen , that is those of the blood groups B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates no human red blood cells that do not contain B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is , parallel to the resur@@ rec@@ ted but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the Anti @-@ B blood group serum or equivalent , with an in@@ undation of blood cells in group B ( 1 ) .
if anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with the same amount of a 5@@ - to 10 % flood of B @-@ blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double period required if the same experiment is carried out with the re @-@ dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or with a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ Human @-@ Glob@@ ulin @-@ serum for use in blood group ser@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G Glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ ini@@ zing antibodies against complementary factors .
it is extracted from the blood of animals , which are immun@@ ised by inj@@ ecting human serum proteins .

in THE ER@@ WA@@ Y that this Convention may not be interpreted in such a way that the Parties shall refrain from their obligations from other international conventions -
in this agreement , measures are set to simplify the convey@@ ance in goods traffic between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA Coun@@ tries ; this is in particular a uniform administrative document ( herein@@ after called the Intro@@ duction Document ) , which is to be used for all export and import procedures as well as for a common shipping method between the contracting parties ( herein@@ after called dispatch procedure ) .
the obligations associated with the goods traffic between the contracting parties are authorised by means of a single paper , for the im@@ prints are to be used in Annex I to this Convention .
depending on the case , the unit paper serves as an application or paper for export , for dispatch or import .
- to be explicitly requested to carry out the legal provisions in force in a contracting party whose application would not be guaranteed with the sole use of the agreement ;
- to be demanded by the parties , so that they may come to the enjoyment of a pr@@ el@@ ude or a certain relief .
( 1 ) This Agreement does not imp@@ ly the contracting parties to apply simplified procedures , also using data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation for the parties involved .
( 2 ) Simp@@ li@@ fied procedures can in particular asser@@ t that the relevant goods are not to be placed at a customs office and the filing for these goods is not to be submitted to the Cust@@ oms Office ; furthermore , the submission of an incomplete registration can be admitted .
in these cases , an application must subsequently be filed with the consent of the competent authorities for a peri@@ odic collection announcement , within the period set by these authorities .
in cases of paragraph 1 , it may be permitted to use trading papers instead of the single paper .
if the unit paper is used , the parties involved can join with the approval of the competent authorities to provide all the obligations associated with export and import instead of supplementary sheets to the import paper in the trade , in which the goods are described .
