<seg id="651">C) At the request of the Community, the organization is prepared to check the investment data that the community considers as being particularly vulnerable to the premises of the community.</seg>
<seg id="652">These data do not need to be materially transferred to the organisation, provided that they remain accessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the Community.</seg>
<seg id="653">A) i) The organization fetches the consent of the Community and States to the naming of inspectors for states.</seg>
<seg id="654">II) If the community cancels either a proposed naming or at any time against a given naming, the organization of the Community and the States proposes one or more alternative denominations.</seg>
<seg id="655">III) In view of the repeated refusal of the Community to agree to the appointment of inspectors of the Organization, which are impeded by the inspections conducted by this Convention, the Council shall discuss the refusal when the General Director of the Organization - hereinafter referred to as "the Director General" - shall discuss with the aim of meeting suitable measures.</seg>
<seg id="656">B) The Community and the States concerned undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the inspectors of the Organization shall actually be able to fulfill the duties incumbent upon them by the Convention.</seg>
<seg id="657">C) The visits and activities of the inspectors of the organization are established in such a way that i) are as low as possible the possible harassment and disturbance for the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities underlying the inspection;</seg>
<seg id="658">II) the protection of industrial secrets and other confidential information is ensured by the inspectors of the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="659">Each State applies to the Organization, including its assets, funds and funds, as well as its inspectors and other officials, to fulfil the tasks of this Convention, the corresponding provisions of the Agreement on the Privileges and exemptions of the International Atomic Energy Organization.</seg>
<seg id="660">The security measures after this agreement are terminated in relation to core material when the Community and the Organization notice that the material has been consumed or diluted in a way that it is no longer usable for nuclear activity that is under the viewpoint of the security measures of Belang, or has practically not become recoverable.</seg>

<seg id="695">The purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of the Section I.</seg>
<seg id="696">The aim of the safety measures set out in this Convention is the timely discovery of the divergence of significant quantities of nuclear weapons by peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive bodies for unknown purposes as well as deterrence by the risk of premature detection.</seg>
<seg id="697">In order to reach the target defined in Article 28, material accounting is used as a preventive measure of fundamental importance, fading with spatial interference and observation as important supplementary measures.</seg>
<seg id="698">The technical completion of the checks by the organisation is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone the quantity of material that has not been verified for a specified period of time is listed under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified gauges.</seg>
<seg id="699">In carrying out their audit, the Organization after article 3 makes full use of the security system of the Community.</seg>
<seg id="700">The accounting and control system of the Community for Nuclear Material in accordance with this Convention is based on a structure in material balance zones.</seg>
<seg id="701">In applying their security measures, the Community of de procedures and measures will make use of the methods and measures of the following kind and, as far as necessary, envisage how they are nearer determined and appropriate in the supplementary agreements:</seg>
<seg id="702">A) a measuring system for ascertaining the quantities of preserved, produced, lost, lost or otherwise derived core material and stock quantities;</seg>

<seg id="708">H) Method of reporting reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69.</seg>
<seg id="709">The safety measures under this agreement do not extend to material in mining or in ore preparation.</seg>
<seg id="710">B) if original or thoriument material, which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described in C), the Community of the Organization shall notify the quantity and composition of the material provided it is not introduced for specifically nonnuclear purposes;</seg>
<seg id="711">C) leaves core material suitable for the composition and purity for fuel production or isotopia enrichment, the plant or the process phase in which it is produced, or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle, so it is subject to the other safety measures mentioned in this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="712">A) The safety measures envisaged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11. however, if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not subject to provisions, the recovery of nuclear material, which is subject to safety measures under this Convention, is temporarily not possible or desirable, the Organization and the Community consult each other about the use of appropriate safeguards.</seg>
<seg id="713">B) The safety measures envisaged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13, provided that the Organization and the Community recognise that this core material is practically non-recoverable.</seg>
<seg id="714">On request of the Community, the organization liberates the following key material from the safety measures under this Convention:</seg>
<seg id="715">A) special fissile material when used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments;</seg>
<seg id="716">B) Nuclear material used in non-nuclear activities after article 13, if such core material is recoverable, and</seg>
<seg id="717">C) Plutonium with an isotope concentration of plutonium-238, which is above 80%.</seg>
<seg id="718">At the request of the Community, the organisation liberates core material which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this Convention, from these safeguards, provided that the entire amount of nuclear material liberated in the States at no time is at any time more than</seg>
<seg id="719">A) a total of one kilogram special paltable material that can consist of one or more of the following materials:</seg>
<seg id="720">II) uranium with enrichment of 0,2 (20%) and above, calculated by multiplying its weight with enrichment,</seg>

<seg id="722">B) a total of ten metric tons of natural uranium and depleted uranium with enrichment of more than 0.005 (0.5%);</seg>
<seg id="723">C) twenty metric tons of depleted uranium with an enrichment of 0.005 (0.5%) or below;</seg>
<seg id="724">Should liberated core material be processed or stored together with core material which is subject to the security measures under this Convention, precautions for the re-application of the security measures are made on that material.</seg>
<seg id="725">The Community meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements, which are necessary in the scope that is required for the successful and effective accomplishment of the tasks of the Organization under this Convention, in detail how to apply the procedures laid down in the Convention.</seg>
<seg id="726">The supplementary agreements can be expanded or amended without amendment of the Agreement between the Organization and the Community.</seg>
<seg id="727">The supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention. the Organization, the Community and the States undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to come into force within ninety days after the entry into force of this Convention; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the Organization, the Community and the States.</seg>
<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report stated in Article 62, the Organization shall establish a consolidated inventory of the whole, the security measures of this Convention in the states, regardless of its origin, and carry on this inventory as a result of the following reports and the results of their investigations.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States of Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other hand</seg>
<seg id="730">The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme set out at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is impeded by general resource transfer problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement, and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted each other about the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the middle links in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the organization of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria laid down in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization establishes a special account under the term "Special Disorder account," which consists of funds which the Member States have contributed to the special interaction account; this account is managed and used by the Organization as Administrator (in this property the organization is referred to as "Administrator" in the following) and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special interaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The fees are to be paid as follows: a) The payment is made in the form of cash or non-interest notes of the member state, which must be paid on request in the currency of the relevant state at the order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction accounts and to be deposited at the deposit office of the organization in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment is made in two instalments (and i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or another between the EEC and the appointed time;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time agreed between the EEC and the Administrator, taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Any Member State may wish to make payments before the above mentioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">In accordance with the usual procedures of the organization, the administrator takes about proportionate concessions to cash or the Notes in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction and offset the special interaction account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">When granting this loan, the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) to the extent that international economic factors contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) the composition and tendency of the country's debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without disagreement; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) The extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each Loan Loan is used to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly-paid development program or project (including a sectoral project) regardless of whether it belongs to the organisation's loan programme or not, according to the procedures and practices that apply, evaluated, approved and managed for the purpose of the preamble to this agreement, named b) of the preamble to this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the transaction must not be used instead of the Bank or Organisation's Bank or Organisation, which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of entry into force of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from paragraph 4, special transactions are subject to the same terms and conditions that are generally applicable to the development loans granted by the organization; they are thus refundable in ten free years each in 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Transaction Loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are repayable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts for payment of this watch must be made directly to the organization that maintains it.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each Loan Loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator in which the origin of the funds is given in particular.</seg>
<seg id="751">Income from each loan contract can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or rendered i) in a member state; ii) in developing countries, which may be members of the organization and that according to what the administrator set at the time of loan granted, recipient of a special transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of a special transaction are made to the special transaction account, and the amount paid in the currency of a member state in the currency of a member state is to be transferred back as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">The caretaker teaches until full disclosure of all the optional loans to the EEC concerning the plans and programmes approved by the directors in preparation for the inspection by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of payment of the special transaction, the caretaker teaches the EEC as a quarterly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expenses made for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">The Administrator conveys the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization, a detailed account of the transaction accounts with an opinion of the external auditors of the organization on this account conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the transaction's loan, the administrator of the EEC as soon as possible communicates a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the special transaction account.</seg>
<seg id="757">The caretaker creates and performs appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special interaction account, the amounts paid out of the account receipts and the deposits paid out of the account and the repayments to the Member States are evident.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the Administrators work closely together to achieve the aims of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the caretaker up to the full issue of the means of the special interaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas on the state of the special interaction account, the progress of programmes or projects financed by special interaction characters, and on all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement has not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date which the EEC and the Organisation may agree, the agreement and all obligations arising therefrom shall be due immediately.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total capital amount of all the special loans taken by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement is repaid and returned to the Member States, this agreement and all obligations arising therefrom shall be terminated with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="762">This agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC as per the procedural rules of each party.</seg>
<seg id="763">The governments of the Member States are notifying the Secretariat General of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings concerned.</seg>
<seg id="764">The General Secretariat forwards these notifications along with a notification of the proper approval of this agreement by the EEC to the Organization.</seg>
<seg id="765">This agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned notifications during the organization.</seg>
