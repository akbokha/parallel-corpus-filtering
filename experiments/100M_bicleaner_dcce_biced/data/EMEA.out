this document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the trials conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg ur@@ l tablets ( tablets which dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. t@@ wir@@ y thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance , a psychological condition in which patients have alternating episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients addressed to the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for fast control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be applied to the intake or the fusion tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
for patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , the same as A@@ bili@@ fy should be reduced , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aria pra@@ z@@ ole is believed to be a &quot; partial ag@@ ony &quot; for the recept@@ ors of the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser degree acts as the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ zophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , whereby psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms are reduced and their recur@@ r@@ ence is prevented .
the efficacy of abili@@ fy to prevent the recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms was studied in three studies over up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ zophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study A@@ bili@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of abili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence , in 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder suffering from increased rest@@ lessness with the combination of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
all studies examined the change in the symptoms of patients by means of a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment .
the company also carried out studies to examine how the body absor@@ bs the enam@@ el tablets and the solution to absorb .
in both trials with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , significantly increased the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness as patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms in four of the five short @-@ time studies more effectively than plac@@ ebo .
abili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks of more effective than plac@@ ebo the recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to take ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled shr@@ ink@@ age ) , headache , blur@@ red vision , headache , blur@@ red vision ( increased s@@ ali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ zophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I dis@@ ruption and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who predominantly had man@@ ic episodes and in whom the man@@ ic episodes referred to the treatment with Ari@@ ela pra@@ z@@ ole compared the risks .
in addition , the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in the fast control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ zophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I failure , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. for the marketing of A@@ bili@@ fy in the European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and related their man@@ ic episodes to the treatment with Ari@@ ela pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day independent of meals .
an increased effectiveness of dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ zophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven .
in consideration of the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no increased risk of suicide in comparison with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pic@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ riding disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted for one year or less , occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l were reported .
if signs and symptoms of late dy@@ n@@ esia occur in a patient treated with abili@@ fy , it should be considered to reduce the dose or cancel the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of a M@@ NS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore Ari@@ pic@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with var@@ ic@@ ose sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ ela pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo in patients treated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extreme and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no accurate risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs that permit direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ony and weakness will be observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ zophren@@ ia patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics where weight gain is known as side effects , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , care should be taken if Ari@@ pic@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally @-@ effective drugs with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects , and similar dose reductions should be made .
with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of aria pra@@ w@@ ls compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sion@@ ers .
considering the joint administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ con@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be carried out .
after sett@@ ling the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be increased to the dose level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be attributed with a moderate increase in the aria lau@@ rate .
in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the medi@@ ums of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ bo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or are pregnant during the treatment with Ari@@ ela pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used in pregnancy because of the insufficient data set for safety in humans and because of the concerns created in the reproductive studies in animals unless the potential benefits un@@ ambig@@ u@@ ously justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative effect on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ zophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including parking in@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ esis , d@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with Hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients treated with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with arith@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with high @-@ gloss therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - in a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ ela pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients suffering from hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients suffering from aria pra@@ w@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ ela pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ ela pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred did not show any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the side effects associated with anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy and the incidence of treatment with Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose stro@@ kes , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older people with dementia , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , accidental or inten@@ tional over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths .
although there is no information about the efficacy of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l , it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis is useful in the treatment of over@@ dose , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ zophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pic@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity for the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , to ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c and 5@@ HT@@ 7 , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
the posit@@ ron @-@ emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent decrease of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ and , Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the Put@@ Name in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for healthy volunteers .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ zophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pic@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant increase in the psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients who contributed to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ ela pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales , which were defined as secondary educational goals including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ A@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ zophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return was found for Ari@@ ela pra@@ z@@ ole , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ ela pra@@ w@@ l group and 57 % in plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ ude @-@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study involving schi@@ zophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) in an average weight of ca .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therapies trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ic study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mono@@ therapies studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic tra@@ its , Ari@@ pic@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed an efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
also in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable share of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics that sometimes did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission during a stabili@@ zation period prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l showed himself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ yl@@ ation of Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in extensive metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in poor &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , and in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study schi@@ zophren@@ ic patients showed no sexually dependent effects .
a pop @-@ up @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics revealed no clin@@ ically significant differences regarding eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ aria were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
one single dose study in subjects with different cir@@ rho@@ sis of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ ela pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ aria , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity coupled with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular hazard to humans .
toxic@@ ological significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have only limited or no meaning for the clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dosage in humans .
in addition , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l in the bile after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the average of 1 to 3 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dosage in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l , found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg , were no more than 6 % of concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the bile of monkeys and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro solu@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the mean steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ zophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ ude @-@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study involving schi@@ zophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) in an average weight of ca .
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ic study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study in which pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l was compared to 30 mg Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l as a solution for healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .

in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the mean steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
A@@ bili@@ fy Inj@@ ection solution is used for rapid control of det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ zophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be termin@@ ated with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution and started with oral application of Ari@@ pic@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase the res@@ or@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended while b@@ yp@@ assing obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if an advanced oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l , see the summary of the features of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy Tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy Mel@@ ting tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution for taking .
there are no tests on the efficacy of Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were different from schi@@ zophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see Section 4.5 ) .
tests on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pic@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ riding disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS include high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ony and weakness will be observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ zophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics where weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pic@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study where healthy volunteers Ari@@ pic@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) were used intra@@ muscul@@ arly as one @-@ off and that at the same time were received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be carried out .
after sett@@ ling the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be increased to the dose level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) were received intra@@ muscular , the intensity of se@@ dation was larger compared to that of the sole gift of Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l .

the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ ela pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with plac@@ ebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients suffering from aria pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ ela pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred did not show any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the side effects associated with anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy and the incidence of treatment with Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose stro@@ kes , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older people with dementia , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the aria pra@@ w@@ l injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant improvements in ag@@ gregation / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared with plac@@ ebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , as well as a@@ gi@@ ti@@ dity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the aria pra@@ w@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms concerning the ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed average improvement from bas@@ eline on P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5.@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gregation , a similar efficacy was observed in terms of the total population , but a statistical significance could be determined on account of a decreased number of patients .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ zophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pic@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant increase in the psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients who contributed to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ ela pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales , which were defined as secondary educational goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ zophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the response rate was observed in the Ari@@ ela pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ ude @-@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study involving schi@@ zophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) in an average weight of ca .
111 . in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics that sometimes did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a 74 week study period in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ ela pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation period prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l showed himself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the AU@@ C is 90 % bigger the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the average time to achieve the maximum plasma levels was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the application of Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human@@ oid therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
in studies for reproductive toxic@@ ity following intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ related concerns were found following mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human@@ oid therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies using Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity coupled with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular hazard to humans .
toxic@@ ological significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; therefore , they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ mentation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dosage in humans .
in addition , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pic@@ ni@@ zo@@ l in the bile after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the mean to 3 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81 @-@ times the recommended maximum dosage in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a main study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which three quarters previously had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a medicine containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients responded to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
if one considers only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drug substance in relation to the efficacy indicators such as time until disease wor@@ sen@@ ing and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatment for their metastatic breast cancer have shown that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , and that in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the launch of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mono@@ therapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in patients with a failed first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not shown ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ rop@@ hili@@ s &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in Neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ie Grad 3 , treatment should be interrupted until an improvement is reached to degree 1 or 2 , and with all subsequent cycles , the dosage must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired kidney function were performed and there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data about harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in patients no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils increase again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number is increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not proven in connection with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac occur@@ ren@@ ces in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea occur in patients after the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ eti@@ cs and con@@ sti@@ lling methods .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
women in child@@ bearing age should use Abra@@ x@@ ane as a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised of a sperm con@@ tainment prior to the treatment , as the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane provides the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect the transport ti@@ ghtness and the ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and significant incidents of adverse events reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , which were treated once every three weeks at 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III clinical trial .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most remarkable hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 , the side effects listed in connection with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication have been reported in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ ten@@ de@@ hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ag@@ ie , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , pain of g@@ ums , loose stools , ec@@ ot@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the abdom@@ en , ul@@ c@@ ers in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , muscle weakness , neck pain , gro@@ in pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , back pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness , very common :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive link in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an An@@ tim@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules substance that promotes the dis@@ assembly of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bul@@ ae and stabili@@ ses the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in trans@@ lu@@ te the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of alb@@ um@@ in to the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 night@@ mare and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( cream @-@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumor occurs .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast carcin@@ oma is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ arm un@@ related studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III study .
in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 m@@ g. / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma .
this multic@@ entre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , who received mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in form of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for preventing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metastatic disease and 19 % for metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 . the results for the general response rate and time to progression of disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are outlined below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 at a time during the therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to decay on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 courses of treatment has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 were determined in clinical trials .
exposure to active substances ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or soft connection from pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with a 30 @-@ minute intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values following a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 m@@ g. / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) than after solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue hist@@ ories it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion of the unchanged active ingredient was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the Met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance .
however , only a few data were available on patients at the age of more than 75 years since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti @-@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and , as with other potentially toxic substances , should be treated with caution when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected slowly over a period of at least 1 minute ( 0.@@ 9 % ) .
after complete en@@ core of the solution , the pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle should rest at least 5 minutes in order to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid .

member states must ensure that the holder of approval for placing on the market will provide medical specialist staff in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials :
• Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging material . • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product , refriger@@ ated boxes for transport through the patient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal product &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels , in which complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ y@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is in@@ ject into a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be performed by the patient or his supervis@@ or if they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ dium deficiency or by not responding adequately to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , capable of producing epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
stre@@ amed was compared as injection into a v@@ ein as part of a main study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems induced an@@ emia , compared with the reference physician .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks long E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ein before they either were en@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values between the start of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of dor@@ z@@ amed spra@@ yed under the skin were studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were en@@ amed for Ab@@ y@@ amed have been maintained to the same degree as those receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / erg@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the bas@@ eline value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ inging , mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
dor@@ z@@ amed must not be applied to patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
dor@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the provisions of the European Union evidence has been demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that produces tran@@ se@@ amed is available to healthcare professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg for the placing of tran@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of the trans@@ fusion demand in adults with solid tum@@ ors , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma , which receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia in the on@@ set of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger surgical procedures that require a large amount of blood for women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
in order to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic operation in adults without iron deficiency where a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml that cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients where the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
influ@@ enza symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall health burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the physician .
an increase in h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
in light of this h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dosage is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the clinical findings indicate that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical findings indicate that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
response symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall health burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the physician .
in light of this h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required for control of the an@@ emia symptoms .
if the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value has increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be maintained 3 times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number &lt; 4@@ 0.000 cells / µ@@ l is increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg increase the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reproduci@@ bility count by ≥ 4@@ 0.000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be maintained three times a week .
if the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by &lt; 4@@ 0.000 cells / µ@@ l relative to the initial value , a response to the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be stopped .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood con@@ ser@@ ae is required , should receive dor@@ z@@ amed in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program begins , so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given over the tube of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circul@@ atory system .
patients suffering from er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( PR@@ CA ) under treatment with any er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin should not receive dor@@ z@@ amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ em@@ ic ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment , unstable ang@@ ina , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
in patients who are eligible for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery and who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , accompanying or underlying diseases : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral vascular disease or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of active effect defined as a reduction in ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes for a non @-@ contact ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium oxide , infections or inflammation , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes &quot; Index &quot; ) , is lower ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5 % ) , which determines thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ k@@ oc@@ yte numbers , and if no other reason of an active loss is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin antibody should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row is considered to be a diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous application of dor@@ z@@ amed in patients with a risk of antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , the upper limit of the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk of severe cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit based on the administration of epo@@ e@@ ins if the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased above the concentration required for control of the an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , the upper limit of the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
according to current findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia associated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
for tumor patients under chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin response should be taken into account for the assessment of the therapeutic efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients who need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with paragraph 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential thro@@ mbo@@ tic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of Pati@@ ents with chem@@ o@@ therapeutic An@@ a@@ emia - Dos@@ age Adju@@ st@@ ment with the Go@@ al to Main@@ tain ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
patients who are eligible for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic operation should be examined and treated according to an@@ a@@ emia , if possible prior to the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ therapy .
patients who undergo a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery should receive adequate thro@@ mbo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ tic and vascular diseases , particularly in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl provides increased risk of postoperative thro@@ mbo@@ tic / vascular events .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ e@@ ine was not shown to improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ emia or to reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when a h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dosage should be adapted to the rising hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit .
in @-@ vitro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in relation to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
about thro@@ mbo@@ tic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ dem@@ a , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , re@@ in@@ al@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin therapy , so also patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent rise in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ mb@@ al events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients undergoing er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine treatment .
regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin therapy , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can lead to thro@@ mbo@@ tic and vascular complications after repeated blood supply .
the genetically engineered epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and in terms of amino acids and carbohydrates , identical to endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ emia patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is specifically stimulating the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and not influ@@ encing leu@@ kop@@ oo@@ esis .

survival and progression of tumour progression were studied in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treated an an@@ a@@ emia consistent with an@@ a@@ emia due to various common malign@@ an@@ cies , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality than in the controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the examined data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa conditions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no accumulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .

prior to market launch and by agreement with the competent authorities of the member states , the holder of the authorization for the placing on the market has to provide medical specialist staff in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials : • Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging material .
the owner of the authorization for the placing on the market has to ensure that the pharmac@@ co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. is operational and functional before the medicine is brought into circulation and as long as the medicine brought into circulation is used .
the owner appro@@ ves the risk management plan stated in the Pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance Plan and additional measures for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance , as agreed in Version 5 of the Risk Management Plan pursuant to version 5 of the Risk Management Plan pursuant to version 5 of the Risk Management Plan pursuant to version 5 of the Risk Management Plan approved in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. .
according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Human Use , &quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided with the next updated report on the safety of the medicine ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • upon receipt of new information , which may have an impact on current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or measures for risk reduction • within 60 days of reaching an important ( drug vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) mil@@ estones • upon request by the E@@ MEA
• In one month before your treatment has suffered a heart attack or stroke • if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time occurring or intensified chest pain ) , there is a risk of a drop in blood in the veins ( deep v@@ ein thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) , for example , if such a blood @-@ crop has occurred in the past .
you suffer from severe disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial hyper@@ tension ) , the cervi@@ cal vessels ( vascular disease of the oti@@ tis ) or cereb@@ ral ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) .
during the treatment with Ab@@ y@@ amed it can occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent rise in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which re@@ stores in further treatment .
your doctor will , if necessary , carry out regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , the dissolution of the red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated before the start of the treatment with dor@@ z@@ amed .
very rare was reported about the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ ost@@ en@@ ia after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( inj@@ ected under the skin ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
in case you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ ost@@ en@@ ia , it will stop your therapy with Cancel and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value can be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death can be increased .
in case of elevated or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may consider an interruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clinical apparent cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion sign due to insufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in level does not exceed a particular value .
according to current findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with dor@@ ms in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa drugs and the desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood @-@ dy@@ e ( h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your dos@@ amed dose accordingly to keep the risk of blood @-@ graf@@ ting ( thro@@ mbo@@ tic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be carefully balanced compared to the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if in the past thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular events have occurred ( e.g. a deep v@@ ein thro@@ mbo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
in case you are a cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ y@@ amed can act as a growth factor for blood cells and in certain circumstances neg@@ atively affect the tumor .
if a larger orthop@@ edic surgery is forthcoming , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be studied and treated accordingly before the start of treatment .
if your values of the red blood @-@ dy@@ e ( h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get dor@@ z@@ amed as there is an increased risk of blood drop after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or used / used recently , even if it is a non @-@ prescription medicine .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( remedies for supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may need certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means of building the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or in HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia affects the treatment , the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will arrange regular blood tests if necessary , to verify the success of your treatment and make sure that the medicine works properly and your h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of tran@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread over two equal sized inj@@ ections .
your doctor will arrange regular blood tests if necessary , to check the success of your treatment and make sure your h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value .
depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and make sure that the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor treating the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in performs regular blood tests .
if necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg will be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor considers this to be appropriate , also learn how to squ@@ e@@ amed herself under the skin .
heart , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages , stroke , transi@@ ent circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , blood cl@@ ots and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin therapy .
eye li@@ ds and lips ( bru@@ ises eye ) and shock @-@ like allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat sensation and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ ost@@ en@@ ia means that not enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution when applying se@@ amed is needed &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations , it can come - regardless of the treatment with dor@@ z@@ amed - to a drop of blood ( thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular events ) .
treatment with dor@@ z@@ amed may be associated with an increased risk of blood pro@@ p after surgery ( post @-@ operative thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular events ) when your initial ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value is too high
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed above are significantly impaired or if you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information .
when a sy@@ ringe has been taken out of the fridge and has reached room temperature ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must either be used or dis@@ car@@ ded within 3 days .
Ac@@ up@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause as well as in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a minor trau@@ matic frac@@ ture such as the stroke ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 125 000 I@@ IS ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the use of ac@@ last@@ a can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ reli@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ up@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ up@@ a .
in the first study , almost 8@@ ,000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was studied over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently suffered hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures has been studied over a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ up@@ a was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator for the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in serum ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) in the blood returned to norm@@ alized or at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of spine frac@@ tures was reduced by 70 % for patients under the plac@@ ebo arm ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) over a period of three years .
the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % compared to all patients with or without oste@@ opor@@ osis ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ up@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of acet@@ one occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
ac@@ last@@ a must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients in the jaw are subject to the risk of kidney disease , reactions to the in@@ fusion centre and oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ up@@ a provides information for doctors who prescri@@ be Ac@@ up@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains information on how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to appro@@ ve the market launch of Ac@@ up@@ a in the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package should be provided and the following key messages include : • In@@ contra@@ indication in pregnancy and lac@@ t@@ ating women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and healthy nutrition • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg ac@@ last@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of ac@@ last@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ reli@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the patient Pa@@ get with Ac@@ up@@ a , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , correspon@@ dingly twice a day at least 500 mg of el@@ em@@ ental calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first ac@@ last@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen can be reduced shortly after the use of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen .
patients with kidney dys@@ functions ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ ta@@ a is not recommended as there are limited clinical experience for this patient group .
dose adaptation is not necessary because bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in elderly patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents under the age of 18 are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , as data about harm@@ lessness and efficacy are missing .
Ac@@ up@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , since only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
prior to the treatment with ac@@ last@@ a , an existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is treated with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to rapid sett@@ ling of the effects of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , correspon@@ dingly twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered a dental examination with appropriate preventive denti@@ stry prior to application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
for patients who require dental intervention , no data is available whether the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefits risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen can be reduced shortly after the use of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of pre@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation reported as a serious side effect was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) in patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ up@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was associated with kidney function disorders , which were used as a decrease in kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the changes in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a limited ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ a compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium values that were below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were performed at 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ up@@ a in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with ac@@ last@@ a in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures after hip frac@@ ture and in the morph@@ ine Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures after a recent frac@@ ture frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of acet@@ one ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions Accor@@ ding to the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical study , local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , were reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area has been reported , mainly in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other denti@@ stry .
7 Study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area of a patient treated with plac@@ ebo .
in the case of an over@@ dose leading to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of ac@@ last@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 females aged 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ ow ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric spinal frac@@ tures ac@@ last@@ a decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
ac@@ la@@ a @-@ treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spine frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on acet@@ ate frac@@ tures resulted in a lasting effect over three years , which resulted in reduced risk for hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ up@@ a significantly increased bone density on lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the lower leg by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
in 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients treated with ac@@ last@@ a ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) , bone biop@@ sies were taken from the pel@@ vic comb a year after the third annual dose .
a micro@@ comp@@ uted tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume compared to plac@@ ebo and the retention of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone replacement marker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the duration of study .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of ac@@ last@@ a reduced B@@ SAP significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was kept at 28 % below the bas@@ eline value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the bas@@ eline value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the bas@@ eline value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the tot@@ ality of the plac@@ ebo group was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group treated with ac@@ last@@ a compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ up@@ a treatment increased the BM@@ D compared to plac@@ ebo treatment at all times .
the Ac@@ up@@ a treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % compared to plac@@ ebo treatment by 5.4 % in total frac@@ tures and 4.3 % compared to the end of the leg .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % of Ac@@ up@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( trial CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the yearly administration of ac@@ last@@ a was not inferior compared to the weekly administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ one related to the percentage change of lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ up@@ a was studied in patients and patients over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , above all light to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( average serum sample of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the average age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron once daily for 2 months was demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for Ac@@ up@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the 6 @-@ month main study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 with Ac@@ up@@ a and the 107 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach was maintained at 141 of patients treated with Ac@@ up@@ a compared to 71 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate in an average duration of 18 months after application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minute in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients resulted in the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be a dose independent .
after that , the plasma level quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long continuous phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life cycles t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a termin@@ ale exclusion period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early phases of distribution ( α and β , with the t ½ -@@ values mentioned above ) presumably represent rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys .
in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose can be found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ clear@@ ances amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearance by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 enzyme systems metaboli@@ zed substances is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -

this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney dysfunction right down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min no dose adaptation of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid required .
as for severe kidney dys@@ functions ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
in studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C are six times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influ@@ encing .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In trials with intraven@@ ous application was administered the ren@@ al tolerance of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in rats using doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) , well tolerated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated ex@@ positions that sufficiently exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred in other organs including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as on the intraven@@ ous injection point .
the most common finding in repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hysi@@ cal met@@ ap@@ hysi@@ se of the long bones in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ phi@@ c effect of the substance .
in rats , a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity of dos@@ ages of 0.2 mg / kg was observed as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ ale ) de@@ formi@@ ties and such of the skel@@ eton .
in rab@@ bits no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was less than 0.1 mg / kg due to low serum calcium levels .

ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens that are made of and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
with the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus , bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is constructed in an un@@ ordered manner , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ up@@ a works by norm@@ alizing bone structure again , ensuring normal bone formation and thus giving strength to the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ lav@@ a .
if you use ac@@ last@@ a with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you take other medicines or have applied / used recently , even if they are not prescription drugs .
for your doctor , it is especially important to know if you are taking medicines that are known to damage the kidneys .
when applying Ac@@ up@@ a together with food and beverages , you should be concerned that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you will take sufficient fluids before and after the treatment with Ac@@ up@@ a .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to take the administration of acet@@ one two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
since Ac@@ up@@ a works for a long time , you may need another dose after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully , so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low during the time after the in@@ fusion .

in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture it is recommended to perform the in@@ fusion of acet@@ one two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of ac@@ last@@ a patients need to be adequately moist@@ ur@@ ised ; this is particularly important in patients receiving a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to rapid sett@@ ling of the effects of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atically exp@@ iring , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of ac@@ last@@ a .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the trials conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not indicated . • It can be used together with another diabetes drug ( dual therapy ) .
it can also be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which cannot be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ di@@ ure@@ a or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ ins or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos @-@ treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ ins or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and blood sugar levels fall , making type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; in doing so , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lu@@ rea , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg doses .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ tion study , the effect of an additional dose of acet@@ one for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lu@@ rea in a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values was 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional dose of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , patients who received Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin showed a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects related to ac@@ tos were blur@@ red vision , upper respiratory tract infection ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain , and hypo@@ th@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , or in patients with liver problems , heart failure , or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high concentration levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in , Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to appro@@ ve the market launch of Ac@@ tos in the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , dom@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and is not suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the use in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at risk of developing at least one risk factor ( e.g. heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain , and e@@ dem@@ a if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in heart failure reports , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased initial liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if AL@@ T mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme levels are to be monitored as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction such as nausea , vom@@ iting , abdominal pain , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme levels are to be checked .
the decision as to whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be conducted prior to the clinical assessment .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected that can stem from fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention .
as a result of h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , a slight reduction of mean ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred as a result of h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution .
similar changes were observed in comparison controlled studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3.1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ tic substance or as dual combination therapy with insulin are the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
following the launch , the treatment with thi@@ az@@ ole indi@@ ones , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , was reported on a occurrence or wor@@ sen@@ ing of a diab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a decrease in visual acuity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but prescri@@ bing doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a if patients report about disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study conducted over 3,5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wants a pregnancy or if this occurs , the treatment should be dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines which are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the fact that the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the hyper@@ insulin sensitivity generated during pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother &apos;s animal , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fet@@ al growth .

these lead to a temporary change of the tower and refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials involving Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents went beyond three times the upper limit of the normal range , but less frequently than in plac@@ ebo , but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lu@@ rea .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
since the market launch rarely has been reported about con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , more frequently , if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summari@@ zing analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients were performed in the groups treated with comparison media .
in the Pro@@ Active study , which was conducted over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms occurred .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome prolifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , leading to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years of therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient to receive insulin despite three months of improvement were random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to those receiving insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosing in the group treated with the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one group was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents was consistently statisti@@ cally significant compared to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 week study of type 2 diab@@ e@@ tics .
in most clinical trials compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction in overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels and a slight increase in LD@@ L cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced overall plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid and elevated HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
in comparison to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol levels was observed under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one while lower values were observed in met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid .
in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post @-@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , both with an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular disease were random@@ ised to receive either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ modified Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma can usually be reached 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to effectiveness in approximately the triple the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies it has been demonstrated that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in rot@@ ting ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma elimination time of unchanged Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral clear@@ ances in the mother &apos;s substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies mice , rats , dogs and monkeys conver@@ ged after repeated administration of plasma volume increase with h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the hyper@@ insulin sensitivity and increased insulin resistance of the mother &apos;s animal , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) the rat increased the incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ole indi@@ ces led to an increased frequency of color@@ ec@@ tal tum@@ ours .

the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study conducted over 3,5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were investigated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ zid .
in clinical studies over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents was consistently statisti@@ cally significant compared to the initial values .
in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post @-@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , both with an effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study missed the target regarding its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the overall mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are connected .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was tested in 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
the study measured the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c spi@@ der that indicated that the blood sugar level was similarly lowered as with another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane need to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( see the complete list of the package insert ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of acet@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weigh@@ ed in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the marketing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice daily if a fast initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly , for example by intensified insulin therapy , can detect the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type of insulin ( fast acting , bi@@ phase , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin @-@ animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage .
if a dose adaptation is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such trips can lead to the use of insulin and meals at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions during therapy and always consult his patients after other medicines they have taken .
4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .

however , a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop gradually : • Light@@ weight hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can be treated by oral intake of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
diab@@ e@@ tics therefore should always have grape sugar@@ s , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven auxiliary person or by glucose given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is achieved within 2 to 8 hours and the total active time is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of spl@@ itting ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites formed by the split is active .

this document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the trials conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
the medicinal product , which is an effective ingredient in ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , is@@ lan@@ in human ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced using the method of the so @-@ called re@@ combin@@ ant technology :

ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id must not be applied to patients who are potentially hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S company for the marketing of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id across the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of the rapidly acting insulin has to be raised , then the amount of long @-@ acting insulin .
3 In case of change to ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient a dose adjustment is required , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such trips can lead to the use of insulin and meals at other times .
5 General conditions and complaints at the administration of patients - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions to the injection point Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma at the injection point ) can occur .
diab@@ e@@ tics therefore should always have grape sugar@@ s , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven auxiliary person or by glucose given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diab@@ etic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diab@@ etic patients who underwent major surgical procedures has shown that a 42 % reduced mortality rate ( blood sugar 4,@@ 4 - 6,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was reduced by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is achieved within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total active duration is about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diab@@ etic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adolescents ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited , but suggest that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .
in@@ fusion systems with ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in concentrations of 0.@@ 05 I.@@ U. / ml - 1,0 I.@@ U. / ml insulin , in the in@@ fusion liquids 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % D glucose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l potassium chlori@@ de are stable for 24 hours at room temperature .
11 If a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such trips can lead to the use of insulin and meals at other times .
13 General conditions and complaints at the administered location - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions to the injection point Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma at the injection point ) can occur .

this can happen : • If you have too much insulin , if you eat too little or have a meal out • if you are more than physically demanding yourself
always put on the cap of your Nov@@ o@@ Let Finish when it is not in use to protect it from light .
take the cap off . • disinf@@ ect the rubber membrane with a medical t@@ amp@@ on • always use a new injection needle for each injection to avoid contamination . • Remove the injection needle straight and firmly on Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let ( Figure A ) • Remove the large outer cap of the injection needle and the inner cap of the injection needle .
follow these steps to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle upward • kno@@ ck a few times with your finger gently against the cartridge .
when air bubbles are present , they will collect on top of the cartridge • Whi@@ le you continue to hold the injection needle upward turn the cartridge by one click towards the arrow ( Figure B ) • Whi@@ le the injection needle still shows upwards , press the pus@@ h@@ button completely in ( Figure C ) • Now , a drop of insulin must be dischar@@ ged from the tip of the injection needle .
• Place the cap back on the finished pen in such a way that the digit 0 is opposite the metering mark ( figure D ) • Check if the pus@@ h@@ button is pressed completely .
if the pus@@ h@@ button is not able to move freely , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle . the scale on the cap is 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .

Aden@@ o@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of de@@ formations , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or rheum@@ atism ( &quot; stones &quot; that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
g@@ out attacks can still occur during the first treatment months ; therefore it is recommended that patients with aden@@ ur@@ ic have even more medicines to prevent sei@@ zur@@ es during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( pseu@@ do @-@ drug ) and by Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol each year .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were less than 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients had taken aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of 80 mg once daily , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients taking 120 mg once daily , in the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of below 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) include headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
in particular in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also involve a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ inary deposits ( including a present report known or present in the medical history and / or rheum@@ atic arthritis ) .
if the serum suppl@@ em@@ entation is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily can be taken into consideration .
in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated so far ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients .
since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recipients , F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or abnormal heart failure , the treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ sow @-@ looking medicines , acute g@@ out can occur during the course of treatment , because the reduction of serum suppl@@ em@@ ental acid can initially mobili@@ se ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of x@@ an@@ thin in urine is in rare cases as far as increasing that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing the Phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function were observed in patients treated with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test prior to the start of the bas@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a treatment and in further course according to clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was not carried out on F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( in@@ hibition of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line metabolism was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
subjects were also associated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure exposure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without the need for dose adaptation for f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient at the same time .
in a study involving test subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily showed an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , suggest@@ ing a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
An@@ ta@@ ci@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the intake of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a decrease in C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ an@@ cies may not include side effects of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or exercising hazardous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1,3 vs. 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extensions ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al correlation with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could occur in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported more than once in all bas@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups , are listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no severe rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients treated with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 4 years .
the related events reported during long @-@ term follow @-@ up studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to indications occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 or at a lower frequency :

the active mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the end product of the pur@@ ine metabolism in humans and is produced within the framework of the reaction @-@ as@@ k@@ ade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for in vitro in@@ hibition that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
clinical trial results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .

the lowering of serum acid levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit of the doctor in week 2 and kept lasting throughout the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl were given 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with cardi@@ oid impair@@ ment The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( D ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage return of serum acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data collected in two years of the Phase 3 open extension study showed that the continued reduction of serum levels of serum levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed a decrease in the incidence of rheum@@ atic sei@@ zur@@ es in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not require treatment against rheum@@ atism ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ out , which resulted in a complete dis@@ appearance of the g@@ out grades up to 24 months in 54 % of the patients .
increased TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5,@@ 0 % ) and also in patients receiving Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5,@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased propor@@ tionally after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in the AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decline of serum acid concentration as long as this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ranges from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration @-@ width reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ el@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found to be un@@ altered f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , acet@@ yl@@ glu@@ c@@ id of the active substance ( 30 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gates ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair found itself as un@@ modified f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , acet@@ yl@@ glu@@ c@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gates ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups kidney failure After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function .
the average total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by approximately the 1.8 times of 7.5 m ⋅ yr / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g ⋅ yr / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

these findings are seen as a result of specific pur@@ ine metabolism and urine composition and are considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been found that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , in which there is a risk of a low vitamin D level .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie down until after the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already used separately from each other in pharmaceuticals approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than with those who took Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ one dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) include headache , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , ul@@ cer@@ ation ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of the es@@ oph@@ agus , dy@@ sp@@ ag@@ ie ( swal@@ lowing disorders ) , ascending abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) as well as sour re@@ pul@@ sion .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ one , vitamin D3 , or any of the other ingredients .
it must not be used in the treatment of o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd. a authorization for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE throughout the European Union .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is to be taken only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following guidelines are to be followed precisely in order to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or let the tablet dissolve in the mouth because there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not lie before the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal ble@@ edings or surgical interventions in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ tures , were reported in patients under the ing@@ es@@ tion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partly these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that point to possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out in case of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ony , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ fitting pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine and get medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of serious adverse events appears to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or continue taking it after symptoms that point to es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all the dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ one no increased risk was identified , ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ oden@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a were rarely reported ( after market launch ) , including some severe and with complications ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually related to tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men predominantly administered intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available which indicate whether the replacement of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients requiring ortho@@ don@@ tic surgery reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning with each patient based on an individual benefits risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as planned on the scheduled week@@ day .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before starting treatment .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time .
patients must therefore wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs , without any clin@@ ically relevant interactions occurring .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate leave no indication of directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports stem from cancer patients , but oste@@ opor@@ osis was reported as well .
nevertheless , absorption of serum calcium was up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ one in an oral over@@ dose can cause hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , ec@@ ot@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ters continued to follow ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ oral neck and the entire body was also maintained .
fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ rate frac@@ ture by 47 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption Dru@@ gs on an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0,@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ gh@@ tly fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in oral bio @-@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ one ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 Distribution studies in rats indicate that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue tissues after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but is then rapidly disper@@ sed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .

following intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ one at 71 ml / min and systemic clearance did not exceed 200 ml / min .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted in rats via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not assumed that the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines is affected by these transport systems .

advoc@@ acy is administered adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical trial were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after one year of treatment ( for example , examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , shorter further studies were carried out in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body in comparison to pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formula and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes to the formulation or the regime should be performed only under the close control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a consequence of a change to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dispens@@ ing of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level regulation ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus level should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , the systemic exposure , measured as a mirror , was comparable with both oral and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus donation levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under lawyer to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate re @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
because Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearance , an adjustment of the adv@@ ent dosage schedule can take several days before the steady state is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral dosage of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be started intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of the application For the suppression of gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - K@@ id@@ ney transplan@@ t Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral dispens@@ ation therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adjustments can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral dispens@@ ation therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily dose of the morning .
dosage recommendation - Adju@@ st@@ ment from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ Inst@@ agra@@ f M@@ ust be converted from twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to one once daily intake of adv@@ ent , so this conversion has to take place in proportion 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant to adv@@ ent once a day , the treatment with the oral initi@@ al@@ dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation must begin for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ tation In adult patients who are switched to adv@@ ent , an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily in the morning .
although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ anc@@ t in lung , pancre@@ atic and col@@ on transplan@@ ted patients , in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , pancre@@ atic transplan@@ t recipients were used in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and for intestinal transplan@@ t recipients in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function In patients with severe liver function disorders , a reduction of the dose may be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function As the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not necessary .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of the serum cholesterol level , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
switch from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine to Adv@@ agra@@ f In switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy caution is advisable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dosage should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of re@@ pul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ bred tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus hormone levels .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dor@@ man@@ t during the first two weeks following transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels should also be controlled after adjustment from pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ agra@@ ph , dose adaptation , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while applying substances that could alter the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus complete blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the steady state has occurred .
clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the levels in the blood do not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in full blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ tations are usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and cardiac and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were generally used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus negative or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formula and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes to the formulation or the regime should be performed only under the close control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which has proven to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formula advoc@@ acy .
for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation adv@@ agra@@ f .
due to possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other plant remedies can be avoided during a treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered because the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , a cham@@ ber@@ - or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy referred to as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore occur under an@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin alterations due to suitable clothing or use of a sun@@ screen with a high protection factor .
if patients taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus may show symptoms of PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , changed state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and blur@@ red vision , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ert , lac@@ tose contain , patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption provide special care .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and therefore increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while adding substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain even concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strong interaction with anti@@ fung@@ al agents such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ id antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio @-@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of the gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus has an effect on the metabolism of other medications Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hibition ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of the Ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and increase the levels of hormon@@ al exposure , it is particularly cau@@ tious to take precau@@ tions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ life time .
the results of a small number of studies in transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events regarding the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ kal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence of 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs is often not exactly determined because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
in the following , the side effects are listed in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) .

infection and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases , as is known , in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , is frequently increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ co@@ tic , prot@@ o@@ zo@@ al ) .
cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ k@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms , including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours in combination with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water solu@@ bility and the high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ sis .
mode of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are likely to be conveyed by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the pul@@ p .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a specific series of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of B cells dependent on the T cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( like inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ -@@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

175 l@@ ung@@ ed patients , 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ as transplan@@ tation and in 6@@ 30 cases after intestinal transplan@@ tation as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant .
overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with the observations of major studies in which pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients .
lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recent multic@@ entre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported on 110 patients who received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in during a 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
a chronic gra@@ ft rejection , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was also less common in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the cases treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus patients came in 21.@@ 7 % of cases for the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans in comparison to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine had to be changed to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were killed by Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute rejection was higher after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syn@@ dro@@ ms in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly lower .
a multic@@ entre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was carried out in 205 patients who underwent a pancre@@ as and kidney transplan@@ tation after a random@@ ised procedure called Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ al@@ dose ( via protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the target level of 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ine , 75 liver and intest@@ ine and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ cervi@@ cal transplan@@ tations ) in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ine , 75 liver and intest@@ ine , and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ cervi@@ cal transplan@@ tations ) , the published clinical results of a mono@@ co@@ tic study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ ital enlargement , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower starting doses of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , which lead to valley mirrors between 10 and 15 n@@ g / ml and recently transplan@@ ted radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , An@@ n Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 4@@ 04 ) .
factors such as low ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ rit and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , mainly via bile secre@@ tion .
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f in stable patients who were killed by pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) in proportion 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) compared to the total daily dose .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dor@@ man@@ t during the first two weeks following transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which has proven to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formula advoc@@ acy .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a .
in the first 24 weeks of the first 24 weeks in the Adv@@ agra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) 3@@ 2.6 % and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) was 29.@@ 3 % .

Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a lack of factor VI@@ II , con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether or not adv@@ ate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , capable of forming the human scent factor VI@@ II .
however , adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but is otherwise produced , so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , among them a study involving 53 children under six years , the use of the medicine for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures has been studied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood vessels was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) include di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
advance may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers in the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of factor VI@@ II @-@ deficiency , the location and extent of the bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events the factor VI@@ II activity in the corresponding period shall not sink below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ U. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
repeat injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk for the patient is over .
during the course of treatment , appropriate determination of factor VI@@ II plasma level is recommended for controlling the dose to be administered and the frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , achieve different in vivo recovery and exhibit different half @-@ lives .
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis For long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be weigh@@ ed .
the rate of administration should be based on the patient &apos;s condition , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against Factor VI@@ II is a well known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II @-@ oriented Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modi@@ fying Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and anti @-@ am@@ n@@ esia of well @-@ known inhibit@@ ors , a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II @-@ product was observed for another , the recur@@ r@@ ence of ( low @-@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women there are no experiences concerning the application of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all with previously untreated patients with higher risk of inhibit@@ ing the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rarely ( frequency based on available data ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor was observed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post operative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirrors in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate revealed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE an 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) after 26 exposure days .
in addition , in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was detected after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
in previously untreated patients a 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) patients treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE showed inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibody ti@@ ter against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients , the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ er gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions in the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE reported about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ id reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a factor factor for the activated Factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( base value of factor VI@@ II @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .

based on the data available since its initial authorisation , the CH@@ MP continues to evaluate the benefit @-@ risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder is to apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited granted the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company will withdraw its application for the application of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissues that connect , surrounds and support other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically altered in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been altered in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , enabling the cancer cells to rebuild the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be restored .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient who found Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the abdom@@ en , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had examined the company &apos;s responses to the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ answered .
based on the review of the submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in injection in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore benefits patients .
the committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate @-@ use &quot; programs with advoc@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways caused by allergy to p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents ages 12 and older , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet which should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ amped .
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be trac@@ ed to con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main parameters were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hay fever symptoms , besides con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , patients receiving a@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was observed , the patients under aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients receiving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ asing ) , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for treating allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( hyper@@ tension ) , heart or vascular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze across the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without bit@@ ing , sm@@ as@@ hing or ch@@ ewing ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms are finished .
it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days as long @-@ term use can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory passages , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as a mon@@ otherapy .
since aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks of ending such a therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , di@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine , or any other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a that can be used per@@ oral or nas@@ al as a worn @-@ out Rhin@@ o drug ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ zu@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient and the data is not sufficient to give appropriate recommendations for dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate recommendations for dosage .
patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or head@@ aches ) must be removed .
patients with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must be withdrawn at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test showed no significant differences between those treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was alone or taken with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in vivo , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine inhi@@ bits C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , however , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies occurred , however , no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and because of the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a presum@@ ption that may result in an impair@@ ment of traffic safety or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms can vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tu@@ ces .

a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ il star@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include in@@ hibition of the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P @-@ sel@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ h@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical studies , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years participated in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine @-@ antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined on the basis of the overall score for the symptoms ( besides nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ) , was significantly higher than in mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than in mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets did not show any significant differences with regard to patient sub @-@ groups defined by sex , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of administration in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the body weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
within the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were badly metaboli@@ zed .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole application of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was to exposure to an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , toxic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
the combination lack@@ ed greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 the drug vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in module 1.@@ 8.1 is well established and works before and while the product is on the market .

A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who had asthma ) .
effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rant , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utilizes the sy@@ rup , the solution to take and the enam@@ el tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the symptom average ( symptom points ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease of the symptom average after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us across the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , for allevi@@ ating symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the current disease progression and may be termin@@ ated after the symptoms have been removed and resum@@ ed during their recur@@ r@@ ence .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study simultaneous consumption of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol did not increase the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may be assumed to be impaired , which may result in an impair@@ ment of traffic safety or the ability to operate machinery .
clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most frequent side effects reported more often than plac@@ ebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical trial of 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches . this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , which was administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P @-@ sel@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses that was administered in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 mg daily .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was given over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was apparent .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ h@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , run@@ off and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can also be classified depending on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the basis of the total equi@@ val@@ ence of the questionnaire for quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined for further forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , because the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology despite the eti@@ ology of the different forms is similar and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since hist@@ am@@ ination is a caus@@ al factor in all age @-@ related diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n will also lead to an improvement in symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of quad@@ rants at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the majority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
improvement of it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced sleep and w@@ aking , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patient &apos;s bi@@ ographies were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant accumulation following a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in vivo does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine inhi@@ bits C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie rich breakfast ) were not based on the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no comparable degree of exposure to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity coupled with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data available which support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis , physical examination and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
approximately 6 % of adults and children metaboli@@ se des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n from 2 to 11 years and experience a higher substance load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between the ages of 2 and 11 is identical to that of children who are normal to metaboli@@ se .
this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this drug should not take .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study simultaneous consumption of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol did not increase the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group , similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , reported 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study involving adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children between 1 and 11 years of age , who were eligible for anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment , received a daily des@@ ol@@ at@@ ad@@ ine dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to children &apos;s population .
in a clinical trial involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study involving adults and adolescents in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ ary of the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was apparent .
in controlled clinical studies , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents .
at a single @-@ day dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials suffered from no impair@@ ment of psych@@ om@@ ot@@ oric .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies on adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not lead to an increase in alcohol induced loss of performance nor to increase drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , run@@ off and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the basis of the total equi@@ val@@ ence of the questionnaire for the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of quad@@ rants at the end of the first dose interval .
the prolifer@@ ation of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in ch@@ ewing gum ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are fully metaboli@@ zed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant drug accumulation following a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , the C@@ max and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is available in type III bra@@ in@@ bottles with a child @-@ safe polypropylene @-@ cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

take a dose of A@@ eri@@ us ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate in mouth once a day to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be opened carefully and the ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate &apos;s dose should be removed without damaging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets daily than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were used ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat was well tolerated in two single dose studies ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
in a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval revealed .
in controlled clinical studies , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measured variables of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , run@@ off and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the basis of the total equi@@ val@@ ence of the questionnaire for quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of fusion tablets daily put in the mouth to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately prior to application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet is removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years of age have not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the plac@@ ebo group was equal and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s enam@@ el tablet proved to be the bio@@ equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the ap@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for engaging des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
in a clinical trial with multiple doses in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measured variables of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this badly @-@ metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) larger than in Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( adults 2 % , children 3 % ) , however , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melt tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 m@@ g. of conventional tablets or ap@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate to take in , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients , but in conjunction with dose studies in children , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us fusion tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who are normally metaboli@@ zing .
this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to that of the plac@@ ebo group .
in infants aged 6 to 23 months , the most frequent side effects reported more often than plac@@ ebo were diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3,@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , no side effects were observed in patients between 6 and 11 years at a dispos@@ able dose of 2.5 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution .
in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children and adult population .
in controlled clinical studies , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can , depending on the duration of symptoms , alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and

in June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics ( CH@@ MP ) officially announced that the company will withdraw its application for A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov &apos;s application for the prevention of the avian H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily be spread by man to person , because human beings have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
when the vaccine is administered , the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to make antibodies to the flu faster when it comes to contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the virus was removed , cleaned and treated as a component of the vaccine with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface which the human body recognis@@ es as foreign body ) .
an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the extent of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine did not suff@@ ice to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your attending doctor .
if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who do not swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for use , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , since the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be prescribed only once the doctor has checked what an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on body weight .
in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
aids not to cure , however , can delay the damage to the immune system and hence the development of infections and illnesses related to AIDS .
A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had not previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the A@@ gener@@ ase drug used in low doses has been compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who previously had taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks in A@@ gener@@ ase more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced viral load , but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors responded very few to the treatment .
in the study involving adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the A@@ gener@@ ase drug used by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r decreased the viral load after 16 weeks as well as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase , together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , to a stronger viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) include headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who use Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( an herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines that are broken down just as a@@ gener@@ ase and are det@@ ri@@ mental in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in use in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years in relation to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic Amp@@ li@@ on@@ avi@@ r Amp@@ li@@ fier , but the Committee noted that the use of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have not previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Gla@@ xo Group Limited Company for the marketing of A@@ gener@@ ase in the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules need to be administered for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic booster of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r should be carried out in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the patient &apos;s pre@@ treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take @-@ in is 14 % lower than that of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r than capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not ex@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are applied without the enhancing addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of ap@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ generations in combination with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate @-@ difficulty liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous use should be carried out in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction . it is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe liver dysfunction ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase should not be given simultaneously with medicines that have low therapeutic width and also present substrates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ is@@ o enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and decreased therapeutic effect of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r during the use of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
in case of simultaneous an@@ tivi@@ ral treatment of the hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids including Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of a@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
in patients taking these medicines at the same time , ap@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
because of the possibility of metabolic interactions with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on pi@@ racy symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ ate content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under the age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be dis@@ continued in the duration of 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ er@@ bation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases that medication needed to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in the case of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immunity , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of initiation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , which leads to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial a@@ eti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrate with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have low therapeutic width and also present substrates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ is@@ o enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are metaboli@@ zed predominantly via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects for increased plasma levels .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
in the attempt to balance the humili@@ ated plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were observed very frequently .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the amp@@ on@@ avi@@ rus mirror and , if possible , check the virus load and to dep@@ ose the St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increased , compared to C@@ max by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r were twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % lower when am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached twice a day with the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is unknown .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the an@@ ta@@ d component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase differ at least one hour ( see ant@@ acids below ) .
therefore , in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ z in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r .
be careful if these drugs should be used at the same time , because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
care should be taken when these medicines are applied together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be carried out as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentrations ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in side @-@ effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction of the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin to at least half the recommended dose is recommended , although there are no clinical data available for this .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been carried out , however , the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 m@@ g. Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2.@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value observed once a day without the simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may result in interactions when used together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions related to these drugs if used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase because it can result in res@@ or@@ ption problems .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r can result in a degradation of the plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine ,
simultaneous use with A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical trial in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are to be expected with pronounced increases in plasma levels while ap@@ gener@@ ase is administered .
because plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this medicine is not recommended with amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r .
more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations is recommended to stabili@@ ze the mirrors as plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased while adding amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase is not allowed to be used in combination with the or@@ ally @-@ recorded Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while with simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am care .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on pi@@ racy symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation on how to adjust the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is given simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of atten@@ uation or strengthening of an@@ thro@@ mbo@@ tic effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this drug may be used during pregnancy only after careful consideration of the possible benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk lac@@ tate rats , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar is transferred to breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given det@@ ach@@ ments to the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding time of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
the further development of offspring , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r to the dam .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and older in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most adverse events associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , rose early and rarely lead to treatment .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are associated with the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time for the treatment of HIV , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
most of the adverse events mentioned below originate from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as associated with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fat sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation .
113 anti@@ retro@@ viral agents who had been treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / ci@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine for a mean duration of 36 weeks was only observed in one case ( pin varnishes ) ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients in Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients with in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin ras@@ hes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ path@@ ian nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be stopped .
oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis cases were reported especially in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immunity , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of initiation of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .

the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in both acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % in@@ hibition concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ranges from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral pre @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based treatment regi@@ mens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ tam@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 included patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors showed resistance patterns that were similar to those of adults .

in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors treated patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ tam@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as well as a reduced lik@@ el@@ ihood of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , clinical vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in combination with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for ass@@ essing the activity of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant insul@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a reduced suscep@@ ti@@ bility to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns generates a certain lat@@ ency resistance to rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data about resistance to cross resistance between amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral patients , in which a Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( one of them demonstrated a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and San@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ) , the in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ite resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early departure of a se@@ eding therapy is recommended in order to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations which can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study where PI pre @-@ treated adults received after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( viral load ≥ 1000 copies / ml ) together with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side hal@@ ide ( SO@@ C ) with an PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose rite .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison with the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub@@ ordination threshold of 0.4 logistics 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bund@@ led ast@@ er@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies A@@ gener@@ ase was examined three times daily , 20 mg / kg daily , 20 mg / kg daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s given together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients en@@ rolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the medi@@ an duration ( T@@ max ) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max on the other hand lowered by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decline of the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained unaffected by food intake , although the simultaneous food intake influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows for a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of c@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or a medium of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , results in a similar daily amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not replac@@ eable on a milli@@ gram @-@ basis .
also , the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of kidney dysfunction is likely to be limited to the elimination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ as lead to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained at healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r twice a day with no simultaneous administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas developed in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications , showed little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ virus and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel testing of mice and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in the clinical routine by measuring AST , AL@@ T and alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase activity .
previously , no significant toxic@@ ity in patients was observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase or after the end of the treatment .
toxic@@ ity studies in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the animals and the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to therapeutic doses in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus operation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are applied without the enhancing addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of ap@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous use should be carried out in patients with low or mild liver dysfunction . it is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe liver dysfunction ( see section 4.3 ) .

A@@ gener@@ ase should be dis@@ continued in the duration of 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer persistent anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased , compared to C@@ max by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached twice a day with the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is unknown .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ z in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
care should be taken when these medicines are applied together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be carried out as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction of the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dosage is 31 , although there are no clinical data available for this .

in a clinical trial in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of atten@@ uation or strengthening of an@@ thro@@ mbo@@ tic effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % or more .
this drug may be used during pregnancy only after careful consideration of the possible benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given det@@ ach@@ ments to the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding time of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and older in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is indic@@ ative of signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in both acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % in@@ hibition concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ranges from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in infected cells and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ite resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , treatment optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children should be considered the benefit of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; ast@@ er@@ ase .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or a medium of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .

the benefit of using k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take in was not occupied with PI pre @-@ treated patients nor with PI pre @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take @-@ in is 14 % lower than that of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r than capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not ex@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inhal@@ ing and low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be given , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although dose adaptation is not deemed necessary for amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col@@ ate content , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these medicines and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of a transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .

simultaneous use with A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
based on the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected following oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . as a result of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the propylene gly@@ col it cannot be used during pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk lac@@ tate rats , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar is transferred to breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given det@@ ach@@ ments to the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding time of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 55 body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and older in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are associated with the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time for the treatment of HIV , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral pre @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based treatment regi@@ mens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
the early departure of a se@@ eding 60 therapy is recommended in order to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations which can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows for a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

the frequency of application and the duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied five times a week for six weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied three times a week during one or two four weeks of treatment cycles .
before bed@@ time , the cream is th@@ inn@@ ed to the affected areas of the skin , so that it remains sufficiently long ( approximately eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed away .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream but without the drug ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with total healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the plac@@ ebo on either daily or five times weekly .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • At the treatment of patients in the genital area , the total recovery rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma showed a complete recovery rate of 66 % to 80 % compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions at the application area of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ ato@@ tic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults if the size or number of l@@ esi@@ ons limit efficacy and / or the acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .

treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is continued until all visible bee @-@ war@@ ts in the genital or per@@ ine@@ al area have disappeared or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an interruption in the treatment process described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if in the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then continue with the usual treatment plan .
apply the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and rub in the clean@@ sed skin area in the clean@@ sed areas until the cream is completely absorbed .
it should be considered in these patients between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with wor@@ sen@@ ing their auto@@ immune disease .
it should be considered in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host response .
in other studies where no daily pre@@ h@@ arity was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and a case with a stri@@ k@@ ture leading to circumcision .
in case of an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have been observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or have led to temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions oc@@ cured at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied methods for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and per@@ ine@@ al area there are no clinical experiences yet .
although limited data suggest an increased rate of influ@@ enza strain in HIV positive patients , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this group of patients regarding the elimination of the influ@@ enza strain .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair attachment has not been studied .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions usually decreases during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creme .
if it is necessary due to patient complaints or because of the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment interval may be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since currently no data on long @-@ term heating rates of more than 36 months after the treatment is available , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered for super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
there are no clinical experience in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the use of previously untreated tum@@ ors is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower lik@@ el@@ ihood of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine therapy .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not investigated for treating acute ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on lip area within the lip .
there are only very limited data on the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical bodies outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ m and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity over the course of the therapy or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creme .
if the local skin reactions cause the patient to have great discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for several days .
out of the data from an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 active l@@ esi@@ ons showed a lower total cure rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to the immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
from animal studies , no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / f@@ red@@ dish development , dis@@ connection or post@@ nat@@ al development emerge ( see 5.3 ) .
although no quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) have been achieved neither after one @-@ off nor after multiple topical application , no recommendation can be given to the application during breast@@ feeding .
the most commonly reported and possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects in the studies with three weeks of treatment were local reactions on the location of the treatment of the genital war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream associated with side effects include complaints at the place of application with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the side @-@ effects reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical study are shown below .
the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effect were in these studies a response to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the adverse events reported by 25@@ 2 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream were listed below .
this assessment of clinical signs indicated in the test plan shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , it frequently came to local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ation / sc@@ rolling / sli@@ pping ( 23 % ) and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
the assessment of clinical signs indicated in the test plan shows that five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream often resulted in severe er@@ y@@ thema ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , severe scor@@ ing and scar@@ ring ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials to investigate the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , Alo@@ p@@ zie was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the accidental oral intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was in hyp@@ ot@@ onia that norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous liquid release .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , it was shown that the effectiveness regarding a complete curing of the case war@@ ts during an i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment is clearly superior .
60 % of patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine treated patients completed the event in full ; this was the case with 20 % of the patients who had been treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five times a week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients remained clin@@ ically healed and this remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od over three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic acute l@@ esi@@ ons within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the hair@@ y scal@@ p or face .
the two @-@ year data from two combined observ@@ ational studies show a recur@@ r@@ ence rate of 27 % for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
the approved indications external cow@@ ards , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials involving children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or so ) .
minimal systemic intake of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three times weekly application for 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations of serum in the serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml on the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 single bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated apparent half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life time after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after topical application on MC @-@ infected skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and was comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month trial of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg were reduced to a significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study carried out for four months for the der@@ mal application did not show similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice when administered three days a week did not in@@ duce tum@@ ours on the application area .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a slight systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ ated , a risk for the human being is to be regarded as very low due to the systemic exposure .
the tum@@ ours occurred in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream , in the past and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years of age has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , defined as any related side effect that occurs during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where res@@ us@@ c@@ itation facilities are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience regarding the recovery of treatment after a longer interruption , the risk of an over@@ sensitivity reaction after an interruption of treatment must be cau@@ ti@@ ously avoided due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of an over@@ sensitivity reaction .
to treat the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , 60 minutes before the in@@ fusion begins with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) .
in the event of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in the event of a single severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous response has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or Proc@@ esses , because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not suggest direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that were exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase above the breast milk are present , it is recommended to do not breast@@ feed during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were primarily classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related responses that were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , observed during the phase 3 study and its extension with a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table according to the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , severe reactions oc@@ cured , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory trac@@ ing and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ desirable drug interactions associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 , with predominantly severe exp@@ ir@@ ation and treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
intraven@@ ous 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 mg / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients were treated with a ser@@ o@@ con@@ i@@ tion within 3 months of the beginning of the treatment , with severe exp@@ ir@@ ation of patients under 5 years of age ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days for patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( resp@@ . to early retirement from the study ) , patients with 13 / 45 patients were not able to detect antibodies that were det@@ ectable by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ recip@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , among them 3 patients with whom it never came to ser@@ o@@ con@@ i@@ tion .
patients with a low to low antibody level showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ tr@@ es a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was detected .
four patients ( three in the Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro , which did not seem to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of unwanted drug reactions , even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the replacement of enzymes is one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of the enzyme activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via Mann @-@ 6 @-@ Phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study who showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( Fe@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected Fe@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms each week for 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to walk , which is shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as highlighted in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of Fe@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the total lung volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a clear litter of the G@@ AG mirror was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patient , which was taken into consideration by using a combined end@@ point , which summari@@ zes clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( an expected percentage normal Fe@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk , movement area of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open Phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with the severe exp@@ ir@@ ation form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - levels in the urine week 22 in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z @-@ score for this age group The younger patients with the severe exp@@ ir@@ ation form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe exp@@ ir@@ ation , only limited or no advances in cognitive development were observed .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage regi@@ mens were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
intraven@@ ous 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 mg / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long term clinical efficacy of these two dosage regi@@ mens is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate every new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the medicine will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of patients under 5 years of age was similar to that in elderly and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional studies of safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ time administration , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot be identified with any particular hazard to humans .
since no tolerance studies have been carried out , this medicine may not be mixed with other medicines , except those listed under 6.@@ 6 .

this register will include long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in a small amount or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase occurred .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another cancer drug ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( medicines for cancer ) and &quot; malign@@ ant &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies than any therapy .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should take a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is given together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti@@ psycho@@ tic &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a liquid deficiency ) should be given before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood pattern changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , dis@@ continued or the dose is reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed thus slow@@ s the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the transformation of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active time in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural oth@@ eli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another cancer drug ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin lived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
patients who had previously received chemotherapy had an average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.@@ 3 months compared to a mean of 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients in whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells showed longer survival compared to the comparison drug in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the European Union .
each pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma except for overl@@ apping epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma except for predomin@@ ant epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid will be given on the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed @-@ Gabe , as well as on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also need to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) a week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose and after each third session cycle .
in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a full blood pattern should be created before each administration , including differentiation of leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and plat@@ el@@ et count .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place under consideration of the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood balance or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles .
after the recovery , patients must be treated according to indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 that are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Level 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ Grad 3 ( excluding ne@@ uro @-@ toxic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value prior to treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be stopped if in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ti@@ o- an ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continues with the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that at the age of 65 years or above , patients at the age of 65 have increased side effects risk .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data about harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearance of less than 45 ml / min was insufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver dysfunction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold upper bili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; to the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ asis ) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value ( for the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically investigated in the studies .
patients must be monitored with respect to bone mar@@ l immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils again reach a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
dose reduction for other cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous courses of treatment ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was be@@ ech@@ o@@ ed when pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed need to be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce toxic toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid taking non @-@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients for which a therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is fores@@ een must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had the appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
for this reason , a drainage of the eff@@ usion before p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment should be considered in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid retention in trans@@ cellular space .
5 Major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , if this active ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible harm to the reproductive capacity is due to p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the treatment g@@ inn to obtain advice regarding the sperm con@@ tainment .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can result in reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed elimination with the result of increased occurrence of side effects .
it is therefore advisable to apply high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses in patients with normal kidney function ( C@@ ret@@ an Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , should be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed .
the in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for using p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - or an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites severe birth defects are expected in the pregnancy .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should not be used during pregnancy except if it is mandatory and after careful consideration of benefits for the mother and the risk of fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity is due to p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the start of treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm con@@ tainment .
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is transferred to breast milk and un@@ desirable effects on the breast@@ fed baby can not be excluded .
the following table shows the incidence and sever@@ ity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma and random@@ ised C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , and 163 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

the clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity level 3 and 4 was similar to the summari@@ zed results of three single P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy studies ( n = 164 ) of phase 2 , excluding neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.@@ 3 % ) and an increase in Alan@@ in@@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to result in differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies include both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and well @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal base values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events that could be possible in connection with the study medication ; they were reported at &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with N@@ SC@@ LC who received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and received 8@@ 30 patients with N@@ SC@@ LC random@@ ised C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine .

A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate that ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting important fol@@ ate @-@ dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .

E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural oth@@ eli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically meaningful advantage compared to those patients who were treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin only .
the primary analysis of this study was undertaken in the population of all patients who received the test medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms resulted from an improvement in lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC demonstrated a medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el from 7.@@ 9 months ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .

limited data from a separately controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) are similar to p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin Com@@ bin@@ ation opposite the gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .

it is applied to overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ calorie , fat @-@ reduced diet .
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can &apos;t break down some fats in the food , causing roughly a quarter of the fats that are fed with the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed into the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , 4@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies on patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients receiving All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ ff@@ ing , vom@@ iting , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , finish o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( fa@@ ec@@ es ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it should not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or using drugs such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used in patients who suffer from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or to cholesterol ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Gla@@ xo Group Limited Company for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ical , fat @-@ reduced diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under the age of 18 , since there is insufficient data for efficacy and safety .
however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ bed , it is not necessary to adapt the dosage to older patients and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other components • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Peri@@ ods of pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Sti@@ ll time ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single @-@ meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a treatment with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti @-@ diab@@ etic drug may be adjusted if necessary .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take extra pregnancy @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures in order to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
when applying War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( international norm @-@ rated ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and the beta car@@ ot@@ ene remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take an additional mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time in order to ensure adequate vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the administration of a one @-@ time A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a small number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time observed a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of in@@ gest@@ ed fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rarely ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
the frequency of known side effects that have been detected after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown since these events have been reported voluntarily by a population of un@@ certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to di@@ lem@@ mas with regard to possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and overweight patients over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
the majority of cases reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing have either reported no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on investigations on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of possible systemic effects deri@@ ving from or@@ list@@ at &apos;s li@@ suited properties can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect sets in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ s .
clinical studies have derived 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , which blocks absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies on adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ical , fat @-@ reduced diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the Gesamt@@ cholest@@ erin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( initial value : 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg / 3.5 % with or@@ list@@ at ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( bas@@ eline : 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of waist measurement was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting point 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable for 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 . in general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma was only spor@@ adi@@ c in plasma and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting of the N @-@ shaped leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified in a study with obes@@ e patients , which represented nearly 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity coupled with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , can@@ o@@ ogen@@ ic potential , and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed may adver@@ sely affect you or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information .
the most common side effects are related to the effectiveness of the capsules and are caused by the fact that fat is increasingly eliminated from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks of the treatment , since at this time you may not have reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms : • Beg@@ in a few days or better a week before the first intake of the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions you normally consume .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fat amount equally on daily meals .
do not save the amount of calories and fat you may consume per meal , in order to take them in the form of a bold main court or a substantial fe@@ at , as you might have done with other programs for weight reduction . • Most people with those accompanying symptoms learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • Do not apply all@@ i after the exp@@ iry date specified on the wrap . • Do not store over 25 ° C . • Ke@@ ep the container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .

Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as for chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ psycho@@ tic medication ) .
the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there are not enough information for the effects of this age group .
this means that the active agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate symptoms for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in the event of chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting showed that 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi were not vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . , for the marketing of Alo@@ xi in the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting induced by strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with am@@ ne@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ pation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be monitored closely after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is required with simultaneous use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that pro@@ long the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi will not be used in the days following chemotherapy neither to prevent or treat nausea and vom@@ iting .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit tumour @-@ oriented activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents studied ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single IV dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady state concentration oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ gi@@ sts , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , Chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Ch@@ ini@@ dine , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences concerning the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events were reported at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly associated with Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ pation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the location ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were performed , but due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy with an over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies a total of 1.@@ 132 patients receiving a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 micro@@ grams or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were received intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron that were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of study with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ised in the following tables .
in clinical trials of indication @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval were comparable to the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
following clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential .
the study conducted in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations , a slow elimination from the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ life time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are usually dose @-@ propor@@ tionally in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3@@ 0,@@ 90 μ / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
following intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentrations measured at 11 tes@@ tic@@ ular carcin@@ oma between day 1 and day was 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations show that the daily intraven@@ ous dose of 0.@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C @-@ ∞ ) with the value measured after one @-@ off intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the setting of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , which in comparison to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron metabolism .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 mc@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered drug made about 40 % of the given dose .
following a single @-@ time intraven@@ ous injection for healthy eyes , the total body was between 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al clear@@ ances 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although the termin@@ ale exclusion period and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased in patients with severe liver dysfunction , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , indicating low relevance for clinical use .
10 From prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , indications have shown that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can pro@@ long the action potential .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to about 30 times the therapeutic exposure in humans ) that were given daily over two years led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , en@@ doc@@ rine Ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al marks ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for a unique application , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for the human being .
the owner of this approval for the placing on the market must inform the European Commission about the plans for placing the medicine approved within the framework of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report , in which the approval of approval for the marketing of the treatment provided for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ e@@ 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease called by viral infection ) .
in the case of a micro@@ scopic investigation the liver tissue damage , and also the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ in amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood ab@@ normally be increased .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) is introduced into which it stimulates the formation of the active substance .
Al@@ ph@@ eon , the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon , presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy of hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference doctor in 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .

in addition , concerns were vo@@ iced that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed cannot suff@@ ice .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease increased again in more patients than with the reference physician ; furthermore , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the question to what extent the drug triggers an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection accompanied by cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected in@@ fir@@ mi@@ ations ( cra@@ cking or cutting wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ w@@ ed wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been demon@@ stra@@ bly or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ seed Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because of this type of infection potentially does not work .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine , but for patients under 18 years of age , the area to be treated may not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) thereby inhibit@@ ing the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 patients ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients ( plac@@ ebo ) responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected Hau@@ tw@@ ins , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together in the skin , about 90 % of patients from both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( egg @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that have been proven or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation to the contracting body .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go were out@@ weigh@@ ed in the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections compared to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ mi@@ ties , abra@@ sions or se@@ w@@ ed wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . Ltd . , appro@@ ving the market launch of Al@@ tar@@ go in the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the event of a sensi@@ tization or serious local irrit@@ ation by the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ination o@@ int@@ ment , treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection will begin .
it should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as a patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient in clinical studies of secondary open wounds .
an alternative therapy should be considered , if after a 2 to 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected passage occurs .
the impact of simultaneous use of retin@@ ap@@ ul@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations which have been reached on the skin or infected surface wounds after topical application , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo cannot be expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the middle re@@ ap@@ am@@ ination AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max increased after topical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ination o@@ int@@ ment on sk@@ im@@ ed skin of healthy adult males by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dosage adjustments are not considered necessary if topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ination is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral ing@@ es@@ tion and are insufficient in relation to a statement affecting the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin &apos;s o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of a systemic antibiotic .
in deciding whether breast@@ feeding should be continued or termin@@ ated with Al@@ tar@@ go , it is advisable to weigh between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women .
in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections that Al@@ tar@@ go had applied was the most commonly reported side effect irrit@@ ation at the location , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of p@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ otrop@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of action of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding site and the pep@@ tide transfer center .
by binding on this binding site , p@@ and@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , block partially P @-@ binding and prevents the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if , due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin may appear question@@ able at least some forms of infection , consultation should be sought by experts .
no differences were found in the in vitro activity of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and on sk@@ inn@@ ed skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ination o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for the topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling procedure took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , maximum individual systemic intake in humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 of de@@ ported skin ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro @-@ oxid@@ ative metabolism of re@@ ap@@ am@@ in@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies of oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro examination of gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in mice lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats micro@@ kernel test for in vivo investigation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dosage of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in up to 5 times higher exposure as the highest estimated exposure in humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 of de@@ ported skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats were diagnosed with oral dosage of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to ≥ 3 @-@ fold of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of fo@@ etus and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .
the holder of approval for placing on the market must ensure that a pharmac@@ co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system , as presented in the 1.@@ 8.1 module of the authorisation application ( version 6.2 ) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix will be used as part of a two @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan , and a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix must be used only if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while im@@ muni@@ zation , and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses can be termin@@ ated .
if a refres@@ her dose is against hepatitis A or B , ambient or other hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defence of the body ) , as it can defend itself against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the in@@ oc@@ ulated vaccine Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults and the V@@ acc@@ ine of Twin@@ rix since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , as part of a vacc@@ ination plan existing from three doses , both adults and children are given children .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ et adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator for efficacy was the percentage of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last inj@@ ections .
in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix performed between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last inj@@ ections for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar to six and a 12 month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ch@@ iness ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to the active ingredients , one of the other constitu@@ ents or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als .
the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ ming with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two doses of vacc@@ ines , the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is given between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a booster for hepatitis A and hepatitis B is desired , vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine may be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) have been observed in the same order as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured that immun@@ o@@ competent persons , who have addressed a hepatitis C vacc@@ ination , need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even with no more det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate treatment and monitoring options should be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the injection of the vaccine .
if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine , containing 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels after the pri@@ ming phase , so that in these cases the administration of additional doses may be necessary .
since intra@@ muscular injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal success in the glut@@ eal muscles , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in case of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix may , however , be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously since it can result in bleeding in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration .
when Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it may be assumed that an adequate immune response may not be achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ri@@ mon@@ y , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever was similar to the frequency observed in the previous thi@@ omer and preserv@@ ative vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 doses were administered on a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 up to 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants aged 12 and including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ch@@ iness on a calculation basis per acc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0,@@ 7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.1 % of the subjects after the dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle reported 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects that had been given to the Ambi@@ rix , about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ri@@ mon@@ y was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. , over the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects receiving Ambi@@ ani compared to 3@@ 6.2 % of subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ri@@ dity was low and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , the presence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ rian group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , there was a frequency of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ p .
the percentage of vacc@@ ines that reported serious adverse events during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination diagram with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9,@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combin@@ ant vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 persons , whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in month 2 and 6 were significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix after 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination .
the immune responses that were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the table below .
both studies received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of pri@@ ming , persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after im@@ muni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that found after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after im@@ muni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was administered at the same time with the fresh@@ ening of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults demonstrated similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for earlier formulation .
the vaccine must be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ en@@ code for any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .
according to Article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , state batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as bathing in waters contaminated by water .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may necess@@ itate stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot protect itself completely from infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series with 2 doses has been completed .
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ines / is ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the point of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections caused by the liver or causing symptoms similar to those after hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be conveyed .
• If you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ambient or any component of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction may be caused by it@@ chy skin ras@@ hes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usual scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
in case of a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child of vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he / she will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of active ingredients per in@@ oc@@ ulation dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of active ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection prior to the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix will be inj@@ ected to people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened by illness or treatment in your / its body defense , or if you / your child is undergoing a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals on vacc@@ ination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines / takes medication ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated recently , or have been given immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or have been planned or planned in the near future .
however , in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated at separate spots and as different extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix will not be given pregnant or lac@@ t@@ ating women , unless it is urgently needed to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix request inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the appointment scheduled for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and make an appointment as soon as possible .
♦ A very often ( more than 1 case per 10 in@@ oc@@ ulated doses ) : • pain or discomfort on the insertion site or redness • Mat@@ ching • irrit@@ ability • headache • loss of appetite
♦ A frequent ( up to 1 case per 10 in@@ oc@@ ulated doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • F@@ ever ( above 38 ° C ) • F@@ ill@@ ed • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal disorders
other side effects that have been reported for days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or individual vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 in@@ oc@@ ulated doses ) are :

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which have become known since the first approval for the placing on the market , the CH@@ MP has assumed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ ani was only brought into circulation in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited because of the limited number of patients .
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients over a month with a complete enz@@ ym@@ atic defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage following high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre @-@ history .
Am@@ mon@@ schn@@ aps - split into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with the food or administered via a gastro@@ pod ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study since Am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared to another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ drug , that is , without drug ) .
Am@@ mon@@ aps may also result in loss of appetite , abnormal aci@@ di@@ fication in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disorders or taste sa@@ c , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval , only limited information on this drug was available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme shortage has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enz@@ ym@@ atic defect that mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , there is an indication of the use if a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy exists in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein absorption needed for the patient &apos;s growth and development .
according to previous clinical experience the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ boo@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ aris bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the formation of es@@ oph@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , respectively 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as in clinical conditions associated with sodium retention and o@@ dem@@ a .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat occurs over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in pregnant women is unknown ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down in neur@@ onal prolifer@@ ation and increased neur@@ ons loss .
there was also a delayed ri@@ pen@@ ing of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a hin@@ dran@@ ce to the brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted by humans into breast milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least 56 % of patients had at least an adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events had assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed metabolic En@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ ac@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cur@@ b top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 @-@ month @-@ old inf@@ ant with an in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ent dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are accompanied by the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity when administered intraven@@ ous doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound that con@@ ju@@ gates to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine by acet@@ yl@@ ation , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
sto@@ ich@@ i@@ omet@@ rically , Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; therefore phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram taken sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately to improve the chances of survival and the clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ant , and the disease itself led to death even in the treatment of per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of life .
by hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative routes of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first life month ) diagnosed diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy and who were previously treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it occurred with time with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ go@@ tic form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) who recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in the case of treatment and in some patients a further wor@@ sen@@ ing of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in the liver and kidneys enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine arises .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after administration of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in metabolism and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous use of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected 15 minutes after intake .
after various doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the majority of patients with ur@@ ic cy@@ kl@@ ine or ha@@ emo@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies found no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma after ni@@ gh@@ tly fasting .
three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine via the kidneys .
according to the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test results , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat no longer treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who can not swal@@ low tablets or swal@@ lowing patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or by a gastro@@ pod or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum protein in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ boo@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ aris bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , respectively 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , corresponding to the maximum daily dose .
when rat fl@@ utes were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) before birth , there were l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed metabolic En@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ ac@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cur@@ b top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
sto@@ ich@@ i@@ omet@@ rically , Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; therefore phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle it can be assumed that the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl can be produced for each gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in the case of treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ular form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected 15 minutes after intake .
during the duration of the shelf life the patient can retain the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient has to receive the drug over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after the consumption of proteins .
if lab tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have been taken recently , even if it is a non @-@ prescription medicine .
during the lac@@ tation period , you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine may pass into the breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , headache , taste disturbances , dis@@ orientation , dis@@ orientation , memory problems and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency reception of your hospital in order to initiate a corresponding treatment .
if you have forgotten taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in blood balance ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes ) , reduced appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention ( swelling ) , taste problems , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , abnormal skin smell , rash , kidney function , weight gain , and abnormal lab results .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed may adver@@ sely affect you or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ iry date specified on the container and the container by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ly to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specified exp@@ iry date . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , the contents of the package AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have been taken recently , even if it is a non @-@ prescription medicine .
they should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS in the same individual doses or take a nas@@ al probe ( hose that runs directly into the stomach through the abdominal wall ) or a nas@@ al probe ( tube , which is fed through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Remove from the container an enclosed measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate . • St@@ ay a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the top of the measuring spoon to remove excess pellets . • The quantity remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; static lifting &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measured value in the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who sub@@ tract a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients suffering from ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox was compared with conventional combination or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI , the patient often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube which remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the use of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year overall as effective as the conventional treatment .
in patients who underwent a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective in regards to all indicators as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ d@@ ju@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other ingredients .
it may not be used in patients who have recently had bleeding , as well as people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for he@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd approval of the launch of An@@ gi@@ ox across the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if early intervention is planned .
the recommended starting dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous injection of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed subsequently , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours .
an injection of 0.5 mg / kg should be given immediately prior to the procedure followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous injection of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the procedure .
the safety and efficacy of any Bol@@ us administration by An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT , after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second release of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT results , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted drug should be carefully mixed before use and the tigh@@ tening dose should be administered intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer necessary , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
for patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ d@@ validation against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1,4 m@@ g. / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second dose of the bolt will be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI trial ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which were included in the approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adaptation at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for patients with di@@ aly@@ sis , An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• severe hyper@@ tension or increased bleeding risk due to a disorder in the hem@@ ost@@ asis system and / or an increased risk of bleeding due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ ost@@ asis system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for patients with di@@ aly@@ sis
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if the majority of the bleeding in the arter@@ ial point of points occur in the case of PCI patients , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur everywhere during the treatment .
in patients who are using war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after the treatment with bi@@ d@@ re@@ din reaches the level before treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes ) it can be assumed that these drugs increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological h@@ emo@@ dynamics parameters in each case are monitored regularly .
the experimental studies are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , dis@@ connection or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ ed@@ ru@@ din group and in the patients treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over the age of 65 were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding has been defined in accordance with the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scales for severe bleeding like in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding were significantly less common among bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ ine than in the groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ dine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- or inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge in the point of punc@@ ture , reduction of the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known bleeding station , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less commonly observed loc@@ al@@ is@@ ations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; point points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information on adverse events is based on the data of a clinical trial with a bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ ine in 6000 patients who underwent a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ ec@@ ru@@ din group and in the patients treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding significantly less frequently occurred in the comparison group under he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after a comprehensive application and are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ classes in table 6 .
in the case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with bi@@ ob@@ to@@ id is immediately broken off and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ ine , a direct and specific thread inhibit@@ or which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic center and the an@@ ion region of thro@@ mb@@ in irrespective of whether thro@@ mb@@ ine is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ ed@@ ru@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , on its part , slowly spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ ed@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
moreover , bi@@ d@@ ag@@ oc@@ yte @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) could not in@@ duce thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te ag@@ gregation .
in healthy volunteers and patients , bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ ine shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent an@@ tic@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is demonstrated by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI has been performed subsequently , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ ob@@ to@@ din should be added and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study arm A frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the start of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or with the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were spread evenly across the 3 arms arms .
about 77 % of patients had a recurring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or elevated cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes who require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the upper arm or administered as a continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a condition in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin cannot be processed effectively .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin differs very slightly from acting insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , where the body cannot work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was found after six months compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin li@@ spr@@ o .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % at human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ sin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the transfer of A@@ pi@@ dra to the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall , th@@ igh or delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdominal muscles .
because of the reduced glucose @-@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function .
any change in effect , the brand ( producers ) , the type of insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can change the insulin requirement .
3 An inadequate dosing or termination of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these states are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin produced by another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the time for the occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change during the treatment of the treatment regi@@ men .
the substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diab@@ e@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of li@@ king agents such as beta block@@ ers , cl@@ oni@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pine , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c anti@@ regulation can be weakened or absent .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin in relation to the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin ly@@ s@@ ine enters human breast milk , but in general insulin does not enter the breast milk nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral use .
in the following , the adverse drug trials known from clinical studies are sorted by system @-@ organ classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 ; rarely ≥ 1 / 100 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
cold sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration problems , di@@ zz@@ iness , excessive dog , changes of vision , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy If ir@@ amed to continuously change the injection point within the injection area , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy may occur at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) administered by a correspon@@ dingly trained person , or by intraven@@ ous injection of glucose by a doctor .
after glu@@ ing the patient , the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption ( in particular by skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) and by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin , the impact occurs quicker and the active duration is shorter than for cou@@ - man@@ like normal insulin .
in a study of 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin lu@@ li@@ sin in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range from 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dose of proportional glu@@ cos@@ al effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a sub@@ proportional increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin has a twice as fast acting as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data it was apparent that in an application of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post @-@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin p@@ li@@ sin was taken 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin p@@ li@@ sin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a similar gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - gro@@ oves before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin by offering 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal was given in comparison to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to a human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin by offering 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal in comparison to human Nor@@ - mal@@ acting , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) .
