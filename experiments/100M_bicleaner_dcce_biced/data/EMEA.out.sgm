<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) evaluated the trials conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your illness or treatment, please read the package insert (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>

<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg url tablets (tablets which dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. twiry thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • bipolar I disturbance, a psychological condition in which patients have alternating episodes (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients addressed to the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for fast control of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be applied to the intake or the fusion tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">For patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, the same as Abilify should be reduced, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" "" "neurotransmitters" "", "i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Aria prazole is believed to be a "partial agony" for the receptors of the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripicnizol like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser degree acts as the neurotransmitter to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripicnizol helps to normalize the activity of the brain, whereby psychotic or manic symptoms are reduced and their recurrence is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of abilify to prevent the recurrence of symptoms was studied in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from increased restlessness, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, in 160 patients where the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder suffering from increased restlessness with the combination of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies examined the change in the symptoms of patients by means of a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies to examine how the body absorbs the enamel tablets and the solution to absorb.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both trials with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, significantly increased the symptoms of increased restlessness as patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms in four of the five short-time studies more effectively than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks of more effective than placebo the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify to take (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled shrinkage), headache, blurred vision, headache, blurred vision (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disruption and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who predominantly had manic episodes and in whom the manic episodes referred to the treatment with Ariela prazole compared the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in the fast control of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I failure, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the marketing of Abilify in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mostly manic episodes and related their manic episodes to the treatment with Ariela prazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day independent of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness of dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for abilify is 15 mg once daily, independent of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">In consideration of the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 Inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Ariadprazole dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of an antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Ariadprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no increased risk of suicide in comparison with other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripicprazole should be used with care in patients with cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, overriding disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials that lasted for one year or less, occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripicnizol were reported.</seg>
<seg id="39">If signs and symptoms of late dynesia occur in a patient treated with abilify, it should be considered to reduce the dose or cancel the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of a MNS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripicprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions associated with varicose seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old with Ariela prazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease had an increased risk of death compared to placebo in patients treated with Alzheimer's disease.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no accurate risk assessments for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that permit direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyphagony and weakness will be observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics where weight gain is known as side effects, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary efficacy of Aripicnizol on the central nervous system, care should be taken if Aripicprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally-effective drugs with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripicnizol, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripicnizol by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects, and similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">With CYP2D6 'poor' (= "poor") metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of aria prawls compared to CYP2D6 extensioners.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the joint administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Iconconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="55">After settling the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be attributed with a moderate increase in the aria laurate.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripicnizol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the mediums of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omebol) and 3A4 (Dextrometorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or are pregnant during the treatment with Ariela prazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used in pregnancy because of the insufficient data set for safety in humans and because of the concerns created in the reproductive studies in animals unless the potential benefits unambiguously justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Ariadprazole has no negative effect on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than in placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Aripicnizol, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parking insonism, acathesis, dystonia and dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients treated with Ariadprazole and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with arithpitizol, and 15.1% in patients with high-gloss therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder - in a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Ariela prazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients suffering from haloperidol-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients suffering from aria prawl treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Ariela prazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Ariela prazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred did not show any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripicnizol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects associated with antipsychotic therapy and the incidence of treatment with Aripicnizol include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose strokes, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older people with dementia, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, accidental or intentional overdosages with Aripicnizol alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information about the efficacy of hematalysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripicnizol, it is unlikely that hematalysis is useful in the treatment of overdose, since Aripiprazl has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripicnizol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disturbance is mediated via the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripicprazole showed in vitro a high affinity for the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4, to serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7, to alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">The positron-emission tomography showed a dose-dependent decrease of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligand, Nucleus caudatus and the PutName in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripicprazole showed a statistically significant increase in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of responder patients who contributed to the study medication was similar in both groups (Ariela prazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measurement scales, which were defined as secondary educational goals including PANSS and the Montgomery-Aberg- depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return was found for Ariela prazole, which was 34% in the Ariela prawl group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Oude-in-controlled, multinational double blind study involving schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which comprised 314 patients and in which the primary study objective was' weight gain ', an increase of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) in an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapies trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a superior efficacy compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapic study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active-controlled monotherapies studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, Aripicprazole showed an efficacy compared to placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Also in week 12 Aripiprazole showed a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics that sometimes did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripicnizol revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission during a stabilization period prior to randomisation, Aripicnizol showed himself superior to the prevention of a bipolar response, predominantly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyylation of Aripicnizol, the N-Dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole in extensive metabolism via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor 'poor' (= "poor") metabolism via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, and in a pharmacokinetic study schizophrenic patients showed no sexually dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-up-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics revealed no clinically significant differences regarding ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripicnizol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripicnizol and dehydro-aria were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">One single dose study in subjects with different cirrhosis of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function in the pharmacokinetics of Ariela prazole and dehydro-aria, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity coupled with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular hazard to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological significant effects were observed only with dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have only limited or no meaning for the clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dosage in humans.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, cholelithiasis was found as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripicnizol in the bile after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the average of 1 to 3 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dosage in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of Hydroxy- Aripicnizol, found in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg, were no more than 6% of concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the bile of monkeys and lie far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of 3 and 11 times the mean steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If an advanced oral treatment is indicated with Aripicnizol, see the summary of the features of the medicine to Abilify Tablets, Abilify Melting tablets or Abilify solution for taking.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no tests on the efficacy of Aripicnizol injection solution in patients with aggregation and behavioural disorders, which were different from schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripicnizol injection solution, patients should be observed in terms of extreme sedation or blood pressure drop (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Tests on the safety and efficacy of Aripicnizol injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (by prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripicprazole should be used with care in patients with cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, overriding disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials lasting a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS include high fever, muscle stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and heart rhythm disorders).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyphagony and weakness will be observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia patients and patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics where weight gain is known as side effects or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of sedation was greater compared to that of Aripicprazole, in a study where healthy volunteers Aripicprazl (15 mg dose) were used intramuscularly as one-off and that at the same time were received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripicnizol, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripicnizol.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="160">After settling the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) were received intramuscular, the intensity of sedation was larger compared to that of the sole gift of Aripicnizol.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events were more common in clinical trials with Ariadprazole injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than in placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than in placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Ariela prazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients suffering from aria prazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients suffering from Ariadprazole and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Ariela prazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred did not show any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripicnizol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects associated with antipsychotic therapy and the incidence of treatment with Aripicnizol include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose strokes, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older people with dementia, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the aria prawl injection solution associated with statistically significant improvements in aggregation / behavioural disorders compared with placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder, as well as agitidity and behavioural disorders, the aria prawl injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms concerning the aggregation and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed average improvement from baseline on PANSS Excitement Component score was 5.8 for placebo, 9,6 for Lorazepam and 8,7 for Aripicnizol.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of sub-groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe aggregation, a similar efficacy was observed in terms of the total population, but a statistical significance could be determined on account of a decreased number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripicprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant increase in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of responder patients who contributed to the study medication was similar in both groups (Ariela prazole 77% (oral) and haloperidol (73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measurement scales, which were defined as secondary educational goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg-depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in the response rate was observed in the Ariela prazol- (oral) group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Oude-in-controlled, multinational double blind study involving schizophrenia over 26 weeks, involving 314 patients and in which the primary study objective was' weight gain ', an increase of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) in an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111. in a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics that sometimes did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripicnizol revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a 74 week study period in manic patients who had achieved remission with Ariela prazole during a stabilization period prior to randomisation, Aripicnizol showed himself superior to the prevention of a bipolar response, predominantly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the AUC is 90% bigger the AUC after administration of the same dose as tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers the average time to achieve the maximum plasma levels was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The application of Aripicnizol injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated administration in systemic exposure (AUC), which was 15- and 5 times over the maximum humanoid therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies for reproductive toxicity following intravenous application, no safety-related concerns were found following maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) over the maximum humanoid therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies using Aripicnizol (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity coupled with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular hazard to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicological significant effects were observed only with dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans; therefore, they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin pigmentation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dosage in humans.</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, cholelithiasis was found as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripicnizol in the bile after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the mean to 3 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81-times the recommended maximum dosage in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="190">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>
<seg id="191">The regulatory authorities must ensure that before and while the product is marketed, the pharmacovigilance system, as described in version 1.0 of module 1.8.1. of the application, is set up and functional.</seg>
<seg id="192">According to the "CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Human Use," the updated risk management plan must be submitted simultaneously with the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR).</seg>
<seg id="193">Furthermore, an updated risk management plan must be submitted when new information is known that can affect the current safety data, the pharmacovigilance plan or measures to risk minimization, within 60 days after an important milestone of the pharmaceutical industry or measures for risk minimization has been met, on request of the EMEA.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a main study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which three quarters previously had an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole gift or as monotherapy) was compared with a medicine containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">Overall, in the main study 72 (31%) of the 229 with Abraxane treated patients responded to the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">If one considers only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the drug substance in relation to the efficacy indicators such as time until disease worsening and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatment for their metastatic breast cancer have shown that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) found that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel, and that in contrast to other paclitaxel, it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abraxis BioScience Limited for the launch of Abraxane in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-Monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast carcinoma in patients with a failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anthracycline-containing therapy is not shown (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophilis &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In Neuropathie Grad 3, treatment should be interrupted until an improvement is reached to degree 1 or 2, and with all subsequent cycles, the dosage must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">No studies with patients with impaired kidney function were performed and there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impairment of kidney function (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data about harmlessness and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is a albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel, which could have significantly different pharmacological characteristics than other formulations of paclitaxel (see section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptomatic treatment is initiated, and the patient must not be treated again with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="283">In patients no renewed Abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neutrophils increase again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte number is increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunction (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a clearly associated cardiotoxicity was not proven in connection with Abraxane, cardiac occurrences in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea occur in patients after the administration of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual antiemetics and constilling methods.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or women in childbearing age, who do not practice effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should use Abraxane as a reliable contraceptive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised of a sperm containment prior to the treatment, as the therapy with Abraxane provides the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (often), which can affect the transport tightness and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and significant incidents of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, which were treated once every three weeks at 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in the pivotal phase III clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most remarkable hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">In Table 1, the side effects listed in connection with the administration of Abraxane as monotherapy at each dose and indication have been reported in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: elevated blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactendehydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dyspagie, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, pain of gums, loose stools, ecotophagitis, pain in the abdomen, ulcers in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, muscle weakness, neck pain, groin pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal muscles, back pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness, very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive link in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and no causal connection with these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an Antimkrotubules substance that promotes the disassembly of the microtubules from the tubulae and stabilises the microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin translute the transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies it has been proven that albumin promotes the transport of albumin to the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 nightmare and due to the albuminous protein SPARC (cream-ted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumor occurs.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast carcinoma is supported by data of 106 patients in two single-arm unrelated studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study, 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg. / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, who received monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in form of solvent-containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premedication for preventing an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy before, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only for metastatic disease and 19% for metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9. the results for the general response rate and time to progression of disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line therapy are outlined below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy Grade 3 at a time during the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to decay on baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 courses of treatment has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 were determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Exposure to active substances (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or soft connection from paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared with a 30-minute intravenous infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with the values following a 3-hour injection of 175 mg. / m2 of solvent-containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher (43%) after the Abraxane administration (43%) than after solvent-containing paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue histories it is reported that paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion of the unchanged active ingredient was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the Metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating a far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data were available on patients at the age of more than 75 years since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light light over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anti-carcinogenic drug and, as with other potentially toxic substances, should be treated with caution when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>

<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood vessels, in which complications may occur in connection with blood transfusion, if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abyamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make a blood donation, Abseamed is inject into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be performed by the patient or his supervisor if they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by an erythropoidium deficiency or by not responding adequately to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, capable of producing epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Streamed was compared as injection into a vein as part of a main study involving 479 patients suffering from kidney problems induced anemia, compared with the reference physician.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected for at least eight weeks long Eprex / Erypo in a vein before they either were enamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in haemoglobin values between the start of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of dorzamed sprayed under the skin were studied with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems, the haemoglobin values of patients who were enamed for Abyamed have been maintained to the same degree as those receiving Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients who continued to receive Eprex / ergypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the baseline value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is a rise in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, stinging, migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Dorzamed must not be applied to patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Doramed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed according to the provisions of the European Union evidence has been demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that produces transeamed is available to healthcare professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>

<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of the transfusion demand in adults with solid tumors, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma, which receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia in the onset of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8,1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, in case of planned larger surgical procedures that require a large amount of blood for women; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>

<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml that cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for paediatric patients where the haemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Influenza symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall health burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In light of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month, or if the permanent haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa dosage is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose required for the control of anaemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The clinical findings indicate that patients with very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The clinical findings indicate that patients with very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week by intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Response symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall health burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="396">In light of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose required for control of the anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If the haemoglobin value has increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be maintained 3 times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the reticulocyte number &lt; 40.000 cells / µl is increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg increase the hemoglobin value ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reproducibility count by ≥ 40.000 cells / µl, the dose should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte number by &lt; 40.000 cells / µl relative to the initial value, a response to the epoetin-alfa-therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (hematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood conserae is required, should receive dorzamed in a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the autologous blood donation program begins, so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the Abseamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of the surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection at the end of dialysis can be given over the tube of a fistula, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulatory system.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from erythropoietin (PRCA) under treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive dorzamed or other erythropoietin (see Section 4.4 - erythroblastemic).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment, unstable angina, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (e.g. venous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients who are eligible for a larger elective orthopedic surgery and who cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program, the application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, accompanying or underlying diseases: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastopenia (PRCA) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of active effect defined as a reduction in haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reticulocyte value should be determined and the usual causes for a non-contact (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium oxide, infections or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the Reticulozytenvalue, taking into account anaemia (i.e. the Reticulocytes "Index"), is lower (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 0.5%), which determines thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers, and if no other reason of an active loss is found, the anti-erythropoietin antibody should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow is considered to be a diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data for immunogenicity in subcutaneous application of dorzamed in patients with a risk of antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic kidney failure, the upper limit of the haemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, increased mortality risk and risk of severe cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit based on the administration of epoeins if the haemoglobin concentration is increased above the concentration required for control of the anaemia symptoms and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure, the upper limit of the haemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to current findings, the treatment of anaemia associated with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which is not yet dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">For tumor patients under chemotherapy, a 2-3-week delay between epoetin alfa and erythropoetin response should be taken into account for the assessment of the therapeutic efficiency of epoetin alfa (patients who need to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is greater than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with paragraph 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential thrombotic events (see Section 4.2 Treatment of Patients with chemotherapeutic Anaemia - Dosage Adjustment with the Goal to Maintain haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the patient's involvement, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">Patients who are eligible for a larger elective orthopedic operation should be examined and treated according to anaemia, if possible prior to the beginning of epoetin-alfa-therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a greater elective orthopedic surgery should receive adequate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, particularly in the underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be excluded that epoetin alfa for patients with an initial haemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl provides increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoeine was not shown to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anemia or to reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, when a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is applied together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporine should be controlled and the Ciclosporindosage should be adapted to the rising hematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In-vitro studies on tumor tissues, there are no indications of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF in relation to hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial indema, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events (cerebral thrombosis, cerebral infarction), cerebral thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, reinalthromboses, and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under erythropoietin therapy, so also patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during the treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent rise in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombocymbal events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients undergoing erythropoetine treatment.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin therapy, surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can lead to thrombotic and vascular complications after repeated blood supply.</seg>

<seg id="531">• In one month before your treatment has suffered a heart attack or stroke • if you suffer from unstable angina pectoris (for the first time occurring or intensified chest pain), there is a risk of a drop in blood in the veins (deep vein thrombosis), for example, if such a blood-crop has occurred in the past.</seg>
<seg id="532">You suffer from severe disorders of the heart (coronary heart disease), the arteries of the legs or arms (peripheral arterial hypertension), the cervical vessels (vascular disease of the otitis) or cerebral (cerebrovascular disease).</seg>
<seg id="533">During the treatment with Abyamed it can occur within the normal range to a slight dose-dependent rise in the number of blood platelets, which restores in further treatment.</seg>
<seg id="534">Your doctor will, if necessary, carry out regular blood tests to regularly check the number of platelets during the first 8 weeks of treatment.</seg>

<seg id="537">In case you suffer from erythroblaostenia, it will stop your therapy with Cancel and determine how your anaemia is best treated.</seg>
<seg id="538">Therefore, Abseamed must be given by injection into a vein (intravenously) if you are treated for anaemia due to kidney disease.</seg>
<seg id="539">A high hemoglobin value can be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death can be increased.</seg>
<seg id="540">In case of elevated or increasing potassium levels, your doctor may consider an interruption of the treatment with Abseamed until the potassium levels are in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="541">If you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clinical apparent coronary heart disease or congestion sign due to insufficient heart rate, your doctor will ensure that your hemoglobin level does not exceed a particular value.</seg>
<seg id="542">According to current findings, the treatment of anaemia with dorms in adults with chronic kidney failure (renal insufficiency), which is not yet dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="543">A 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin-alfa drugs and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the efficacy of Abseamed.</seg>
<seg id="544">Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood-dye (hemoglobin) and adjust your dosamed dose accordingly to keep the risk of blood-grafting (thrombotic event) as low as possible.</seg>
<seg id="545">This risk should be carefully balanced compared to the benefits derived from the treatment with epoetin alfa, especially if you have an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, e.g. if you are obese (obese) or if in the past thrombotic vascular events have occurred (e.g. a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).</seg>
<seg id="546">In case you are a cancer patient, remember that Abyamed can act as a growth factor for blood cells and in certain circumstances negatively affect the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="547">If a larger orthopedic surgery is forthcoming, the cause of your anaemia should be studied and treated accordingly before the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="548">If your values of the red blood-dye (hemoglobin) are too high, you should not get dorzamed as there is an increased risk of blood drop after surgery.</seg>

<seg id="552">Depending on how your anaemia affects the treatment, the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control.</seg>
<seg id="553">Your doctor will arrange regular blood tests if necessary, to verify the success of your treatment and make sure that the medicine works properly and your hemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value.</seg>
<seg id="554">Once you are well set, you will receive regular doses of transeamed between 25 and 50 I.U. / kg twice a week, spread over two equal sized injections.</seg>
<seg id="555">Your doctor will arrange regular blood tests if necessary, to check the success of your treatment and make sure your hemoglobin value does not exceed a particular value.</seg>
<seg id="556">Depending on how the anaemia refers to the treatment, the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control.</seg>
<seg id="557">To ensure this and make sure that the hemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value, the doctor treating the hemoglobin performs regular blood tests.</seg>
<seg id="558">If necessary to shorten the treatment time before surgery, a dose of 300 I.U. / kg will be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery, on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery.</seg>
<seg id="559">However, if your doctor considers this to be appropriate, also learn how to squeamed herself under the skin.</seg>
<seg id="560">Heart, heart attacks, cerebral haemorrhages, stroke, transient circulatory disorders of the brain, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, blood clots and blood clots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under erythropoietin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="561">Eye lids and lips (bruises eye) and shock-like allergic reactions with symptoms such as tingling, redness, itching, heat sensation and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases.</seg>
<seg id="562">Erythroblaostenia means that not enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone marrow (see section "Special caution when applying seamed is needed").</seg>
<seg id="563">After repeated blood donations, it can come - regardless of the treatment with dorzamed - to a drop of blood (thrombotic vascular events).</seg>
<seg id="564">Treatment with dorzamed may be associated with an increased risk of blood prop after surgery (post-operative thrombotic vascular events) when your initial haemoglobin value is too high</seg>

<seg id="568">It is used in patients with a high fracture risk (bone fractures), including in patients who have recently suffered a minor traumatic fracture such as the stroke; • Morbus Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment; patients with hip fracture should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125 000 IIS) orally or by injection into a muscle before the first infusion.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen (remedy against inflammation) shortly after the use of aclasta can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after the infusion, such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache.</seg>
<seg id="571">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Acrelia may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease.</seg>

<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who had recently suffered hip fracture; the number of fractures has been studied over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">In the case of Morbus Paget, Acupa was tested in two studies on a total of 357 patients and compared with risedron (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator for the efficacy was whether the alkaline phosphatase content in serum (an enzyme that builds bone substance) in the blood returned to normalized or at least 75% compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spine fractures was reduced by 70% for patients under the placebo arm (without any other osteoporosis medicine) over a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="578">The risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41% compared to all patients with or without osteoporosis (with or without any other osteoporosis medicine).</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fracture, 9% of patients under Acupa had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of the side effects of acetone occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledron acid or other bisphosphonate or any other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients in the jaw are subject to the risk of kidney disease, reactions to the infusion centre and osteonnecrosis (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Acupa provides information for doctors who prescribe Acupa for the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains information on how to use the medicine, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following key messages include: • Incontraindication in pregnancy and lactating women • Required of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and healthy nutrition • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, an intravenous infusion of 5 mg aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the infusion of aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Acrelia should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After a treatment of the patient Paget with Acupa, a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, correspondingly twice a day at least 500 mg of elemental calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of aclasta (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acetamol or ibuprofen can be reduced shortly after the use of acetamol or ibuprofen.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney dysfunctions (see section 4.4) In patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Actaa is not recommended as there are limited clinical experience for this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Dose adaptation is not necessary because bioavailability, distribution and elimination in elderly patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents under the age of 18 are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, as data about harmlessness and efficacy are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Acupa is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), since only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Prior to the treatment with aclasta, an existing hypokalemia is treated with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to rapid settling of the effects of zoledron acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia can develop whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, correspondingly twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene should be considered a dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry prior to application of bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who require dental intervention, no data is available whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefits risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acetamol or ibuprofen can be reduced shortly after the use of acetamol or ibuprofen (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of prefibrillation reported as a serious side effect was increased (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) in patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Acupa (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction of Zoledron acid was associated with kidney function disorders, which were used as a decrease in kidney function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The changes in the Kreatinin Clearance (measured annually before administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a limited renal function were comparable in a clinical study in osteoporosis over three years between the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase of serum creatinins within 10 days of administration was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with aclaa compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values that were below the normal fluctuation area (less than 2,10 mmol / l) were performed at 2.3% of patients treated with Acupa in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with aclasta in the Morbus Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study on preventing clinical fractures after hip fracture and in the morphine Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study on preventing clinical fractures after a recent fracture fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of acetone (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions According to the administration of zoledron acid in a large clinical study, local reactions to the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, were reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the jaw area has been reported, mainly in cancer patients, about osteonecroses (primarily in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dentistry.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 Study with 7,736 patients showed osteonnecrosis in the jaw area of a patient treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of an overdose leading to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a compensation can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or an intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in postmenopausal women (7,736 females aged 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density value (BMD) T-score for the Schenkelow ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebral fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric spinal fractures aclasta decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclaa-treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of spine fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on acetate fractures resulted in a lasting effect over three years, which resulted in reduced risk for hip fractures by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Acupa significantly increased bone density on lumbar spine, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, the lower leg by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">In 152 postmenopausal osteoporosis patients treated with aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), bone biopsies were taken from the pelvic comb a year after the third annual dose.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputed tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume compared to placebo and the retention of the trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone replacement marker The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during the duration of study.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of aclasta reduced BSAP significantly by 30% compared to baseline and was kept at 28% below the baseline value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the baseline value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the baseline value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. ally or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The totality of the placebo group was 10% (101 patients) in the placebo group treated with aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients).</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the Acupa treatment increased the BMD compared to placebo treatment at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Acupa treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% compared to placebo treatment by 5.4% in total fractures and 4.3% compared to the end of the leg.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures was 7.5% of Acupa-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (trial CZOL446M2308), the yearly administration of aclasta was not inferior compared to the weekly administration of alendrone related to the percentage change of lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Acupa was studied in patients and patients over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, above all light to moderately heavy Morbus Paget of the bone (average serum sample of alkaline phosphatase according to the average age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledron acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of risedron once daily for 2 months was demonstrated in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the baseline for Acupa and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the 6-month main study (responded to the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 with Acupa and the 107 patients treated with Risedronat who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic approach was maintained at 141 of patients treated with Acupa compared to 71 of patients treated with Risedronate in an average duration of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of zoledron acid in 64 patients resulted in the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be a dose independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma level quickly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long continuous phase very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life cycles t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ β 1.87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminale exclusion period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early phases of distribution (α and β, with the t ½ -values mentioned above) presumably represent rapid resorption in the bones and excretion via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 h, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose can be found in the urine, while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-clearances amounts to 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion but had no effect on the surface below the curve (plasma concentration at time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearance by cytochrom P450 enzyme systems metabolized substances is unlikely because zoledron acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolism-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Specific patient groups (see section 4.2) correlated with the Coledron-Clearance Coloedron-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinin Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min) in the 64 patients.</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in an easy (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney dysfunction right down to a creatinin-clearance up to 35 ml / min no dose adaptation of the zoledron acid required.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for severe kidney dysfunctions (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest intravenous intravenous dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0.6 mg / kg body weight in rats.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies on dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC are six times the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influencing.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In trials with intravenous application was administered the renal tolerance of zoledron acid in rats using doses of 0.6 mg / kg as 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose that corresponds to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in accumulated expositions that sufficiently exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure, toxicological effects occurred in other organs including gastrointestinal tract and liver, as well as on the intravenous injection point.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common finding in repeated use was an increased primary Spongiosa in the metaphysical metaphysise of the long bones in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, antiresorphic effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats, a teratogenicity of dosages of 0.2 mg / kg was observed as external and internal (viscerale) deformities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">In rabbits no teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed, although the maternal toxicity was less than 0.1 mg / kg due to low serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Oledron acid is a representative of a substance called bisphosphonate and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens that are made of androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">With the Paget Morbus, bone reconstruction is too fast, and new bone material is constructed in an unordered manner, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Acupa works by normalizing bone structure again, ensuring normal bone formation and thus giving strength to the bone.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) evaluated the trials conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) in which metformin (a diabetes drug) is not indicated. • It can be used together with another diabetes drug (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can also be applied to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), which cannot be satisfactorily adjusted with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonydiurea or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonyresins or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Actos-treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should reduce the dose of the sulfonyresins or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and blood sugar levels fall, making type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of acettos in tripletherapy was studied; in doing so, patients received a combination of metformin with sulfonylurea, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg doses.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletion study, the effect of an additional dose of acetone for existing treatment with metformin and sulfonylurea in a lowering of the HbA1c values was 0.94%, while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study investigating the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, patients who received Actos in addition to insulin showed a reduction in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects related to actos were blurred vision, upper respiratory tract infection (colds), weight gain, and hypothesia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, or in patients with liver problems, heart failure, or diabetic ketoacidosis (high concentration levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin, Actos should be used as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited to approve the market launch of Actos in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, domed and carry on one side the marking" "" "15" "" "and on the other side the inscription" "" "Actos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and is not suitable for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, therefore the use in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of developing at least one risk factor (e.g. heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain, and edema if pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular Outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in heart failure reports, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased initial liver enzyme (ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If ALT mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme levels are to be monitored as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme levels are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision as to whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pioglitazon should be conducted prior to the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been detected that can stem from fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a slight reduction of mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred as a result of hemodilution.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparison controlled studies with Pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and hematokrits by 3.1-2% and hematokrits by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sulfonytic substance or as dual combination therapy with insulin are the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Following the launch, the treatment with thiazole indiones, including pioglitazone, was reported on a occurrence or worsening of a diabetic macular edema with a decrease in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribing doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema if patients report about disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study conducted over 3,5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wants a pregnancy or if this occurs, the treatment should be deprecated (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the interactions have shown that Pioglitazone has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines which are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC of Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that the treatment with pioglitazone reduces the hyperinsulin sensitivity generated during pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother's animal, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 10000, very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (not estimated from present data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the tower and refractive index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials involving Pioglitazone, ALT ascents went beyond three times the upper limit of the normal range, but less frequently than in placebo, but less often than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylurea.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe heart failure under pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo if pioglitazone or pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch rarely has been reported about congestive heart failure under pioglitazone, more frequently, if pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with congestive heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summarizing analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with pioglitazone and over 7,400 patients were performed in the groups treated with comparison media.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study, which was conducted over a period of 3.5 years, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific receptors (Peroxisome proliferator activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)), leading to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Gliclazid as monotherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years of therapy, blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone at 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient to receive insulin despite three months of improvement were randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to those receiving insulin; a reduction of insulin dosing in the group treated with the Pioglitazone group was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotients was consistently statistically significant compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18 week study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo, a reduction in overall plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels and a slight increase in LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced overall plasmatriglycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclazid and elevated HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels was observed under pioglitazone while lower values were observed in metformin and Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of over 20 weeks, Pioglitazone not only reduced the triglycerides, but also improved the post-prandial increased triglyceride level, both with an effect on triglyceride absorption and hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macular disease were randomised to receive either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, whereby the peak concentrations of unmodified Pioglitazone in plasma can usually be reached 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV corresponds to effectiveness in approximately the triple the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies it has been demonstrated that Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in rotting (55%) and to a lesser extent in urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination time of unchanged Pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral clearances in the mother's substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies mice, rats, dogs and monkeys converged after repeated administration of plasma volume increase with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that the treatment with pioglitazone reduces the hyperinsulin sensitivity and increased insulin resistance of the mother's animal, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) the rat increased the incidence of hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary bladder.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazole indices led to an increased frequency of colorectal tumours.</seg>

<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study conducted over 3,5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were investigated with pioglitazone or gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease of the albumin / creatinin quotients was consistently statistically significant compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of over 20 weeks, Pioglitazone not only reduced the triglycerides, but also improved the post-prandial increased triglyceride level, both with an effect on tryglycerid absorption and hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study missed the target regarding its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the overall mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary reascularisation and revascularisation of leg arteries, the results suggest that with taking Pioglitazone no cardiovascular long-term risks are connected.</seg>

<seg id="886">However, a hypoglycaemia can develop gradually: • Lightweight hypoglycemias can be treated by oral intake of glucose and sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics therefore should always have grape sugars, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemia with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven auxiliary person or by glucose given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the maximum effect is achieved within 2 to 8 hours and the total active time is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of splitting (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot be identified with any particular hazard to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1092">Actrapid must not be applied to patients who are potentially hypersensitive to insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1093">In addition, the doses of actrapid must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar.</seg>

<seg id="1225">In healthy volunteers the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of Febuxostat increased proportionally after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in the AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is greater than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the Cmax amounts to about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>

<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formula and the appropriate daily dosage; changes to the formulation or the regime should be performed only under the close control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a consequence of a change to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dispensing of Advagraf should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood-level regulation (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus level should be controlled before the changeover and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>

<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of tacrolimus donation levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under lawyer to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate re-transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Because Tacrolimus is a substance with low clearance, an adjustment of the advent dosage schedule can take several days before the steady state is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1422">Further dosage adjustments can be required later, as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change in the course of the patient's stabilization after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplant Prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral dispensation therapy should start at 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily dose of the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - Adjustment from Prograf to AdvInstagraf Must be converted from twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules to one once daily intake of advent, so this conversion has to take place in proportion 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After switching from other immunosuppressant to advent once a day, the treatment with the oral initialdose recommended in kidney and liver transplantation must begin for prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplantation In adult patients who are switched to advent, an oral initialdose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken daily in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Although there is no clinical experience with advanct in lung, pancreatic and colon transplanted patients, in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, pancreatic transplant recipients were used in an oral initialdose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and for intestinal transplant recipients in an oral initialdose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function In patients with severe liver function disorders, a reduction of the dose may be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function As the kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of the kidney function (including a regular determination of the serum cholesterol level, a calculation of the creatinin and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switch from Ciclosporine to Advagraf In switching from a Ciclosporin to a Tacrolimus-based therapy caution is advisable (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dosage should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of repulsion and tolerability in individual cases with the aid of thoroughbred tacrolimus hormone levels.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of tacrolimus dormant during the first two weeks following transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Tacrolimus blood levels should also be controlled after adjustment from prograf to advagraph, dose adaptation, changes of immunosuppressive therapy or while applying substances that could alter the tacrolimus complete blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low clearance, adjustments of the dose may require several days until the steady state has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">Clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the levels of tacrolimus in full blood in the first time after liver transplantations are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and cardiac and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects, which may occur as a result of tacrolimus negative or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formula and the appropriate daily dosage; changes to the formulation or the regime should be performed only under the close control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which has proven to be resistant to other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data for the retarded formula advocacy.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and transplant recipients in childhood, there are no clinical data for the retarded formulation advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other plant remedies can be avoided during a treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is offered because the tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, a chamber- or septum hypertrophy referred to as cardiomyopathy was observed under Prograf, which can therefore occur under anagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunction, infections, fluid overload and oedema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin alterations due to suitable clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients taking Tacrolimus may show symptoms of PRES such as headaches, changed state of consciousness, convulsions and blurred vision, a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and therefore increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Therefore, it is recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while adding substances that can alter the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain even concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strong interaction with antifungal agents such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, Iconazole and Voriconazole as well as with the Macroid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio-availability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of the gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Tacrolimus has an effect on the metabolism of other medications Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibition; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 can affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus can reduce the Clearance of the Steroid contraceptives and increase the levels of hormonal exposure, it is particularly cautious to take precautions about contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal studies have shown that tacrolimus can potentially reduce the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and extend their half-life time.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of studies in transplant patients do not indicate that in comparison to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events regarding the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that Tacrolimus is not dialysis.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mode of action and pharmacodynamic effects On the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus are likely to be conveyed by its binding to a cytosol protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for the enrichment of the connection in the pulp.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a specific series of lymphokin genes.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations, which lead to an increase in the unbound fraction of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, mainly via bile secretion.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC 0-24) under Advagraf was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf in stable patients who were killed by prograf (twice daily) in proportion 1: 1 (mg: mg) compared to the total daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a lack of factor VIII, congenital blood clotting disorder).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether or not advate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but produced according to a method called recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, capable of forming the human scent factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">However, advate is similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, but is otherwise produced, so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, among them a study involving 53 children under six years, the use of the medicine for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures has been studied.</seg>

<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of advate (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) include dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advance may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against the human clotting factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of factor VIII-deficiency, the location and extent of the bleeding and the patient's clinical condition.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period shall not sink below the specified plasma levels (in% of the standard or in I.U. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII plasma level is recommended for controlling the dose to be administered and the frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and exhibit different half-lives.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose, a test must be carried out to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures have to be weighed.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of administration should be based on the patient's condition, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against Factor VIII is a well known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the prooagulatory activity of factor VIII-oriented IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma by modifying Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anti-amnesia of well-known inhibitors, a recombinant factor VIII-product was observed for another, the recurrence of (low-trigen) inhibitors.</seg>

<seg id="1561">In addition, in none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) a FVIII inhibitor was detected after previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients a 5 out of 25 (20%) patients treated with ADVATE showed inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The patient's immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibody titer against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of antibody level against anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since its initial authorisation, the CHMP continues to evaluate the benefit-risk assessment as positive, but considered that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which makes filing of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder is to apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited granted the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) officially that the company will withdraw its application for the application of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissues that connect, surrounds and support other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically altered in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus," which has been altered in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could have been injected directly into the tumors, enabling the cancer cells to rebuild the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the non-defective p53 gene in the human body usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni cancer, in which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient who found Li-Fraumeni cancer in the abdomen, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had examined the company's responses to the questions asked, there were still some questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the submitted documents, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin injection in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore benefits patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that advexin can be produced in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform the CHMP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or "compassionate-use" programs with advocate.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changing drug release" "" "means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal pathways caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosa swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents ages 12 and older, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily a tablet which should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are clamped.</seg>
<seg id="1658">Treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be traced to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main parameters were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms, besides constipation of the nose, patients receiving aaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was observed, the patients under aerinaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients receiving desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chasing), dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (drowsiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or Loratadin (another medicine for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma (hypertension), heart or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (cerebral haemorrhage) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of aerinaze across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is swallowed whole (i.e. without biting, smashing or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms are finished.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days as long-term use can decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory passages, treatment can be continued with desloratadin as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since aerinaze contains Pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within 2 weeks of ending such a therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergolid, dihydroergotamine, or any other deongestiva that can be used peroral or nasal as a worn-out Rhino drug (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, Oxymetazoline, Napzuolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient and the data is not sufficient to give appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suffice to pronounce appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with cardiac arrhythmia • Patients with cardiac arrhythmia • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck obstruction or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze must be withdrawn at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, as antihistamines otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadin in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between those treated with desloratadin and placebo-treated patients regardless of whether desloratadin was alone or taken with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine inhibits CYP2D6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, however, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies occurred, however, no increase in the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and because of the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a presumption that may result in an impairment of traffic safety or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms can vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lettuces.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, breathing failure, cardiac arrhythmia, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, pre-cordimental pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, blurred vision and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (mouth dryness, pupil starre and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include inhibition of the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-seltin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Deshatadin 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance, including the amplification of subjective somnolence or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years participated in seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine-antagonistic efficacy of aerinaze tablets, determined on the basis of the overall score for the symptoms (besides nasal mucosal swelling), was significantly higher than in monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than in monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets did not show any significant differences with regard to patient sub-groups defined by sex, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the body weight of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the framework of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study, which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects of Desloratadin were badly metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole application of Pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was to exposure to an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, toxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination lacked greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of lauatadin / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in module 1.8.1 the drug vigilance system described in module 1.8.1 is well established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the introduction of desloratadin, severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rashes have been reported.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, heart chasing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, dizziness, sleeping disorders, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, cases of liver inflammation and cases of conspicuous hepatic values has also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilisate (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg / ml syrup tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies with seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies in patients who had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrant, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution to take and the enamel tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease in the symptom average (symptom points) by 25 to 32% compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies in Urtikaria, the decrease of the symptom average after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared to 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, lauatadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of Aerius across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, for alleviating symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to the current disease progression and may be terminated after the symptoms have been removed and resumed during their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="1732">Persistent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with desloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study simultaneous consumption of Aerius and alcohol did not increase the performance-reducing effect of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may be assumed to be impaired, which may result in an impairment of traffic safety or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more adverse events in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most frequent side effects reported more often than placebo were tiredness (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical trial of 578 youthful patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headaches. this occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study, which was administered up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-seltin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses that was administered in the desloratadin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) was given over ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval was apparent.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Deshatadin 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance, including the amplification of subjective somnolence or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, runoff and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can also be classified depending on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the basis of the total equivalence of the questionnaire for quality of life of Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was examined for further forms of the Urticaria, because the underlying pathophysiology despite the etiology of the different forms is similar and chronic patients can be recruited prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamination is a causal factor in all age-related diseases, it is expected that in other forms of urticaria, desolatadin will also lead to an improvement in symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reduction of size and number of quadrants at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the majority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadin compared to 19% of patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius significantly reduced sleep and waking, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which the patient's biographies were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications of clinically relevant accumulation following a daily application of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin in vivo does not inhibit CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine inhibits CYP2D6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desloratadin in a dosage of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) were not based on the availability of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies performed with Desloratadin and Loratadin showed no comparable degree of exposure to desloratadin, no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity coupled with repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals, to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that there are no data available which support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis, physical examination and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Approximately 6% of adults and children metabolise desloratadin from 2 to 11 years and experience a higher substance load (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between the ages of 2 and 11 is identical to that of children who are normal to metabolise.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This drug contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or sucrose-isomaltase- insufficiency of this drug should not take.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Aerius tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study simultaneous consumption of Aerius tablets and alcohol did not increase the performance-reducing effect of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius syrup group, similar to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, reported 3% more adverse events in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multi-dose study involving adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children between 1 and 11 years of age, who were eligible for antihistamine treatment, received a daily desolatadine dose of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In a clinical trial involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which desloratadin was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharmacological study involving adults and adolescents in which desloratadin was used in a dose of 45 mg daily (the Neunary of the clinical dose) over ten days in adults, no extension of the Qtc interval was apparent.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical studies, no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1779">At a single-day dose of 7,5 mg, Aerius tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials suffered from no impairment of psychomotoric.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical-pharmacological studies on adults, the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not lead to an increase in alcohol induced loss of performance nor to increase drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, runoff and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As shown on the basis of the total equivalence of the questionnaire for the quality of life of Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reduction of size and number of quadrants at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The proliferation of this limited metabolic phenotype was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations larger in black (18% adults, 16% children) than in chewing gum (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with the syrup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which are fully metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) by Desloratadin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the Cmax was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-life time of approximately 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no indications of clinically relevant drug accumulation following a daily application of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) for 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In various single dose studies, the Cmax and Cmax values of desloratadin in paediatric patients were comparable with those of adults who received desloratadin syrup in a dose of 5 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics (CHMP) officially announced that the company will withdraw its application for Aflunov's application for the prevention of the avian H5N1 influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and older people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears, which can easily be spread by man to person, because human beings have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">When the vaccine is administered, the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as "foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to make antibodies to the flu faster when it comes to contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the virus was removed, cleaned and treated as a component of the vaccine with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface which the human body recognises as foreign body).</seg>
<seg id="1900">An inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the extent of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine did not suffice to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment, please contact your attending doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like more information on the basis of CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>

<seg id="1906">Agenerase should be prescribed only once the doctor has checked what antiviral medicines the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood of the virus to respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of kritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, Agenerase reduces the HIV-quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Aids not to cure, however, can delay the damage to the immune system and hence the development of infections and illnesses related to AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was investigated in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had not previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The Agenerase drug used in low doses has been compared to other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who previously had taken protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously had no protease inhibitors, after 48 weeks in Agenerase more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced viral load, but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors responded very few to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study involving adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the Agenerase drug used by Ritonavir decreased the viral load after 16 weeks as well as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, it came under Agenerase, together with Ritonavir, to a stronger viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who continued their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amponavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may not be used in patients who use Johanniskraut (an herbal supplement for treating depression) or medicines that are broken down just as agenerase and are detrimental in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, the risk of lipodystrophy is the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteonnecrosis (death of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in use in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years in relation to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic Amplionavir Amplifier, but the Committee noted that the use of Agenerase in combination with kritonavir in patients who have not previously taken protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the Glaxo Group Limited Company for the marketing of Agenerase in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1-infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Agenerase capsules need to be administered for pharmacokinetic booster of amonavir along with low doses of kritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amputavir should be carried out in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the patient's pretreatment (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to take-in is 14% lower than that of Amprenavir than capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram base are not exchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase Capsules is 600 mg amponavir twice daily along with 100 mg of kritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase Capsules are applied without the enhancing addition of kritonavir (booster), higher doses of apgenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg amputavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amponavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgenerations in combination with low doses of kritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate-difficulty liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous use should be carried out in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction. it is contraindicated in patients with severe liver dysfunction (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase should not be given simultaneously with medicines that have low therapeutic width and also present substrates of the cytochrome P450-iso enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and decreased therapeutic effect of amponavir during the use of amponavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with Agenerase, does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of kritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">In case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of the hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing reduced liver function including chronic-active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolized via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroids including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International Regulated Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking these medicines at the same time, apgenerase can be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of amponavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Because of the possibility of metabolic interactions with amponavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, however, the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amonavir, patients should therefore be monitored on piracy symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycolate content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under the age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be discontinued in the duration of 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases that medication needed to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In the case of haemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematoma and haemarthrosis occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immunity, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop at the time of initiation of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), which leads to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial aetiology is accepted (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonnecrosis were reported in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term use of antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrate with low therapeutic width Agenerase must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have low therapeutic width and also present substrates of the cytochrome P450-iso enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with kritonavir may not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are metabolized predominantly via CYP2D6 and are associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects for increased plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction of the AUC of Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to balance the humiliated plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, adverse effects on the liver were observed very frequently.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amponavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes Johanniskraut, the amponavirus mirror and, if possible, check the virus load and to depose the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nelfinavir is given together with Amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, compared to Cmax by 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg amponavir were twice daily and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower when amonavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma, which were reached twice a day with the combination of Amprenavir (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, a close-meshed monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and harmlessness of this combination is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was carried out in combination with Didanosin, but due to the antad component of Didanosin it is recommended that the revenues of Didanosin and Agenerase differ at least one hour (see antacids below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amponavir (600 mg twice daily) and kritonavir (100 mg twice daily), no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirz in combination with amonavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggests that nevirapin may reduce the serum concentration of amputavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Be careful if these drugs should be used at the same time, because Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Care should be taken when these medicines are applied together; a thorough clinical and virological surveillance should be carried out as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amponavir and kritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of amputavir and rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentrations (AUC) of Rifabutin by 193%, resulting in an increase in side-effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction of the dosage of rifabutin to at least half the recommended dose is recommended, although there are no clinical data available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with asgenerase in combination with erythromycin have not been carried out, however, the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg. Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in the Cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to 2.69fold compared to the value observed once a day without the simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may result in interactions when used together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions related to these drugs if used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on data from other protease inhibitors it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as Agenerase because it can result in resorption problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulants known as enzyme ductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amonavir can result in a degradation of the plasma levels of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine,</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous use with Agenerase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase the side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors, including hypotension, blurred vision and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical trial in which Ritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days to subjects, the endogenous cortisol dropped by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous administration of asgenerase with ritonavir along with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are to be expected with pronounced increases in plasma levels while apgenerase is administered.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Because plasma levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of this medicine is not recommended with amputavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations is recommended to stabilize the mirrors as plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased while adding amputavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase is not allowed to be used in combination with the orally-recorded Midazolam (see Section 4.3), while with simultaneous use of Agenerase with parenteral midazolam care.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Midazolam by 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amonavir, patients should therefore be monitored on piracy symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation on how to adjust the Amprenavir- dose if Amprenavir is given simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with asgenerase, increased control of the INR (International Regulated Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of attenuation or strengthening of anthrombotic effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional dose of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended with simultaneous administration of Agenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This drug may be used during pregnancy only after careful consideration of the possible benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Amponavir-related substances have been detected in the milk lactate rats, but it is not known whether Amprencaviar is transferred to breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was given detachments to the uterus until the end of the breastfeeding time of Amprenavir, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of offspring, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of amonavir to the dam.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Agenerase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and older in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most adverse events associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, rose early and rarely lead to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are associated with the use of Agenerase or another at the same time for the treatment of HIV, or whether they are a result of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the adverse events mentioned below originate from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg Agenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as associated with the study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment (Grade 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral therapy was associated with a redistribution of the body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and fat subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsocervical fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">113 antiretroviral agents who had been treated with amponavir in combination with lamivudine / cidovudine for a mean duration of 36 weeks was only observed in one case (pin varnishes) (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 in 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients in Amprenavir 7 cases (3%) in 241 patients with indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makulopathian nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Amprenavir had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteonnecrosis cases were reported especially in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term use of antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immunity, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop at the time of initiation of antiretroviral therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg Agenerase twice daily along with low dosed rite (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of side effects (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable to those who were observed under sole Agenerase treatment; an exception were raised of triglyceride and CPK values that occurred very frequently in patients who received Agenerase along with low dosed kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient is indicative of signs of intoxication (see Section 4.8), if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the process of viral Gag- and gag-pol- polyproteinsions with the result of a formation of non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied in both acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) of Amprenavir ranges from 0,012 to 0.08 µM in infected cells and is 0,41 µM in chronic infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral pre-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir doses - as with other ritonavir-based treatment regimens with protease inhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral patients who received 700mg of Fostamrenavir with 100mg of kritonavir twice a day in the study ESS100732, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, whereby 14 isolates could be genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 out of 14 children in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 included patients with protease inhibitors showed resistance patterns that were similar to those of adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, G48V, I62V, I54L, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the study APV30003 and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg of Ritonavir twice a day: n = 107) patients with protease inhibitors treated patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic resistance tests based on genotypic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of amponavir / ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, or I50V, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / V, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased phenotypic resistance to Fostamrenavir with ritonavir as well as a reduced likelihood of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypic resistance testing, clinical validated phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in combination with the genotypic data for assessing the activity of amputavir / ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors-resistant insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical-phenotypic cut-offs for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced susceptibility to amponavir associated genetic patterns generates a certain latency resistance to ritonavir, but the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data about resistance to cross resistance between amponavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral patients, in which a Fosamprenavir (one of them demonstrated a resistance to Lopinavir and Sanpranavir), the indinavir / kritonavir (three of 25 isolates), indinavir / kritonavir (three of 24 isolates), indinavir (three of 24 isolates) and tipranavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the other hand, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other proteasehemite resistant insulates; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early departure of a seeding therapy is recommended in order to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations which can adversely affect the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study where PI pre-treated adults received after virological failure (viral load ≥ 1000 copies / ml) together with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and nucleoside halide (SOC) with an PI, predominantly with low-dose rite.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the partial study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-inferiority of APV / Ritonavir in comparison with the SOC-PI group in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-subordination threshold of 0.4 logistics 10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbundled asterase is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies Agenerase was examined three times daily, 20 mg / kg daily, 20 mg / kg daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dose of Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of NRTIs given together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>

<seg id="2045">The administration of amputavir with a meal leads to a 25% decline of the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous food intake influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and allows for a large distribution volume as well as an unobstructed penetration of amponavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of unbound amponavir, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While absolute concentration of unbound amponavir remains constant, the percentage of free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or a medium of CYP3A4 must be administered cautiously if they are given simultaneously with Agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, results in a similar daily amputavir exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is made from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and Agenerase Capsules are not replaceable on a milligram-basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of kidney dysfunction is likely to be limited to the elimination of amponavir and kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemas lead to amponavir plasma levels comparable to those obtained at healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg amputavir twice a day with no simultaneous administration of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity with amponavir in mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas developed in male animals, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8-fold (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of amonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the development of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">The present exposure data on humans, both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications, showed little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-virus and in-vitro-genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames test), mouse lymphom test, microkernel testing of mice and chromosomal aberrations in human peripheral lymphocytes, Amprenavir was neither mutagen nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in the clinical routine by measuring AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase activity.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Previously, no significant toxicity in patients was observed in clinical trials, neither during the administration of Agenerase or after the end of the treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg amputavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amponavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous use should be carried out in patients with low or mild liver dysfunction. it is contraindicated in patients with severe liver dysfunction (see section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2072">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, a close-meshed monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and harmlessness of this combination is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirz in combination with amonavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Care should be taken when these medicines are applied together; a thorough clinical and virological surveillance should be carried out as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amponavir and kritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>

<seg id="2078">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with asgenerase, increased control of the INR (International Regulated Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of attenuation or strengthening of anthrombotic effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0,035 mg Ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg Norethindron) led to a decrease in the AUC and Cmin of Amprenavir by 22% or more.</seg>

<seg id="2086">On the other hand, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other proteasehemite resistant insulates; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>

<seg id="2192">In cases where such reactions occured at the exit of the urethra, some women had difficulty passing urine, which necessitated an emergency catheterisation and treatment of the affected area.</seg>
<seg id="2193">For the application of Imiquimod cream immediately following treatment with other cutaneous applied methods for the treatment of external genital warts in the genital and perineal area there are no clinical experiences yet.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Although limited data suggest an increased rate of influenza strain in HIV positive patients, imiquimod cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this group of patients regarding the elimination of the influenza strain.</seg>
<seg id="2195">The treatment of basal cell carcinoma with Imiquimod within 1 cm around the eyelids, nose, lips, or hair attachment has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Local skin reactions are common, but the intensity of these reactions usually decreases during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with Imiquimod creme.</seg>
<seg id="2197">If it is necessary due to patient complaints or because of the severity of local skin reactions, a treatment interval may be made of several days.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Since currently no data on long-term heating rates of more than 36 months after the treatment is available, other suitable forms of therapy should be considered for superficial basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">There are no clinical experience in patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs, therefore the use of previously untreated tumors is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tumours (&gt; 7.25 cm2) there is a lower likelihood of response to imiquimiodine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not investigated for treating acute keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on lip area within the lip.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data on the use of imiquimod for the treatment of acute keratoses in anatomical bodies outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratose on the forearm and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application, therefore such application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions often occur, but these reactions usually decrease in intensity over the course of the therapy or go back after the treatment with Imiquimod creme.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause the patient to have great discomfort or are very strong, the treatment may be exposed for several days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Out of the data from an open clinical study, patients with more than 8 active lesions showed a lower total cure rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immunostimulatory properties, imiquimod cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">From animal studies, no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / freddish development, disconnection or postnatal development emerge (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although no quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) have been achieved neither after one-off nor after multiple topical application, no recommendation can be given to the application during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly reported and possibly or possibly with the application of Imiquimod cream related side effects in the studies with three weeks of treatment were local reactions on the location of the treatment of the genital warts (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and probably or possibly with the application of the Imiquimod cream associated with side effects include complaints at the place of application with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The side-effects reported by 185 with Imiquimod cream from a placebo-controlled Phase III clinical study are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, probably or possibly with the application of the Imiquimod cream related side effect were in these studies a response to the application site (22% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The adverse events reported by 252 in placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials with Imiquimod cream were listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">This assessment of clinical signs indicated in the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with Imiquimod cream, it frequently came to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excreation / scrolling / slipping (23%) and oedema (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The assessment of clinical signs indicated in the test plan shows that five times weekly treatment with imiquimod cream often resulted in severe erythema (31%), heavy erosions (13%), severe scoring and scarring (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials to investigate the use of Imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratose, Alopzie was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental oral intake of 200 mg Imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, was in hypotonia that normalized after oral or intravenous liquid release.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic investigation, increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interferon and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies, it was shown that the effectiveness regarding a complete curing of the case warts during an imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is clearly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">60% of patients with Imiquimiodine treated patients completed the event in full; this was the case with 20% of the patients who had been treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 patients treated with Imiquimod, compared to 5% of 161 treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod in five times a week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficial basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented in an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients remained clinically healed and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The effectiveness of Imiquimod over three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic, non-hypertrophic acute lesions within a contiguous 25 cm2 area of treatment on the hairy scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The two-year data from two combined observational studies show a recurrence rate of 27% for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods (35 / 128 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications external cowards, actinic keratose and superficial basal cell carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials involving children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the dosages studied there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or so).</seg>
<seg id="2234">Minimal systemic intake of the 5% imiquimod cream by the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratose was observed during the three times weekly application for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations of serum in the serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml on the face (12.5 mg, 1 single bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated apparent half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life time after subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod was low after topical application on MC-infected skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and was comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratose or superficial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month trial of dermal toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg were reduced to a significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study carried out for four months for the dermal application did not show similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice when administered three days a week did not induce tumours on the application area.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a slight systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutated, a risk for the human being is to be regarded as very low due to the systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumours occurred in the group of mice treated with the active-free cream, in the past and in greater numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>
<seg id="2242">It may harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you. − If any of the adverse events you notice is adversely affected or you notice side effects that are not stated in this user information, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2243">● Newarts (condylomata acuminata), which have formed on the skin in the area of genitalia (sexual organs) and anus (anus) ● superficial basal cell carcinoma. this is a common, slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If it remains untreated, it may cause distortions, especially in the face - so early detection and treatment is important.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Actinic keratoses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who have been exposed to much of the sunlight during their life.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should only be applied to flat acute keratoses in the face and scalp in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most suitable treatment for you.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Aldara Cream supports your body's immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to fight the superficial basal cell carcinoma, the actinic keratose or the virus responsible for the infection.</seg>

<seg id="2251">If this daily cleansing is not performed under the foreskin, the occurrence of swelling, thinning of the skin or difficulty in returning the foreskin can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="2252">Do not apply Aldara Cream in urethra (urethra), vagina (vagina), cervix (cervix) or anus (anus).</seg>
<seg id="2253">Taking other medications have serious problems with your immune system, you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2254">If you have sexual intercourse during the infection with genital warts in the genital area, the treatment with Aldara cream after sexual intercourse (not before) is to be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have other medicines or have recently applied, even if it is a non-prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Do not breastfeed your baby during the treatment with Aldara Cream, as it is not known whether Imiquimod is transferred to breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment varies with case warts, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratose (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara Cream onto the clean, dry skin with the coward and gently rub the cream on the skin until the cream is fully absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with cowards under the foreskin must retreat the foreskin every day and wash the skin area underneath (see section 2 "What do you need to consider before using Aldara Cream?").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Apply a sufficient amount of Aldara Cream each week for 6 weeks in order to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area.</seg>

<seg id="2263">Inform your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you do not feel comfortable during the use of Aldara Cream.</seg>
<seg id="2264">If your skin reacts too much to the treatment with Aldara cream, you should not use the cream again, wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2265">A reduced number of blood cells can make you more susceptible to infection; it can cause you to get a blue stain sooner or it can cause fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the side effects listed may adversely affect you or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in areas where you have applied Aldara cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Usually these are lighter skin reactions which end within about 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally some patients notice changes in the place of application (wound secretions, inflammation, swelling, scoring, skin disturbance, blisters, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally some patients suffer from changes in the place of application (bleeding, inflammation, wound secretions, sensitivity, swelling, small swollen areas in the skin, tingling, pain or discomfort), inflammation of the nasal mucosa, nasal pain, diarrhea, actinic keratose, redness, facial swelling, ulcers, body aches, fever, weakness or chills.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms not associated with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and thus accumulate in the body in most organs and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged livers, stiff joints that complicate movements, reduced lung volumes, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with revitalizing devices and patients may need drugs before administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study mainly investigated the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness was also measured (by examining its effect on the reduction of the GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) include headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat sensation, fever and reactions at the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under the age of five are increased blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measure of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may react very hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will examine each year all new information that may be known and, where necessary, update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive althirazyms in regard to the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted Genzyme Europe B.V. to approve the marketing of Aldurazyme in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammalian cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be performed by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyms in adults over 65 years of age has not been determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme may develop infusion-related reactions, defined as any related side effect that occurs during the infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where resuscitation facilities are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that almost all patients form IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience regarding the recovery of treatment after a longer interruption, the risk of an oversensitivity reaction after an interruption of treatment must be cautiously avoided due to the theoretically increased risk of an oversensitivity reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2296">To treat the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions, 60 minutes before the infusion begins with drugs (antihistamines and / or antipyretics).</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the event of a mild or moderate infusion-related reaction, the treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to half the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the event of a single severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous response has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used at the same time with chloroquine or Processes, because there is a potential risk of interfering with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not suggest direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns that were exposed to laronidase above the breast milk are present, it is recommended to do not breastfeed during the treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were primarily classified as infusion-related responses that were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions related to Aldurazyme, observed during the phase 3 study and its extension with a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table according to the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 10); often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre-history, severe reactions occured, including bronchospasm, respiratory tracing and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Undesirable drug interactions associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5, with predominantly severe expiration and treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">Intravenous 100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 mg / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients were treated with a seroconition within 3 months of the beginning of the treatment, with severe expiration of patients under 5 years of age (average after 26 days compared to 45 days for patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (resp. to early retirement from the study), patients with 13 / 45 patients were not able to detect antibodies that were detectable by radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP) assay, among them 3 patients with whom it never came to seroconition.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a low to low antibody level showed a robust reduction in the GAG mirror in the urine, while in patients with high antibody titres a variable reduction of GAG in urine was detected.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic Laronidase- activity in vitro, which did not seem to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of unwanted drug reactions, even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the replacement of enzymes is one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of the enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via Mann-6-Phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study who showed the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were from the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FeV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FeV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyms each week for 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Aldurazyms showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to walk, which is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as highlighted in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FeV is clinically not significant over this period and the total lung volumes increased proportionally to the size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear litter of the GAG mirror was found in the urine (µg / mg of creatinin), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patient, which was taken into consideration by using a combined endpoint, which summarizes clinically significant changes across five efficacy variables (an expected percentage normal FeV, distance in the 6-minute walk, movement area of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open Phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were studied in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with the severe expiration form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- levels in the urine week 22 in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were determined according to the Z-score for this age group The younger patients with the severe expiration form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed a normal mental development speed, whereas in older patients with severe expiration, only limited or no advances in cognitive development were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosage regimens were performed on the GAG mirror in the urine, liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">Intravenous 100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 mg / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long term clinical efficacy of these two dosage regimens is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate every new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the medicine will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile of patients under 5 years of age was similar to that in elderly and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on conventional studies of safety harmacology, toxicity in one-time administration, toxicity in repeated administration and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot be identified with any particular hazard to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another cancer drug) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (medicines for cancer) and "malignant" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body) or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used in patients who have not been treated before, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapies than any therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, patients should take a Corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is given together with cisplatin, before or after the administration of cisplatin, a "antipsychotic" (medicines for vomiting) and liquids (to prevent a liquid deficiency) should be given before or after the administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood pattern changes or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, discontinued or the dose is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetremixed thus slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of pemetremixed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active time in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleural othelioma, Alimta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another cancer drug), both in combination with cisplatin in 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin lived an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months at the sole administration of Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">Patients who had previously received chemotherapy had an average survival time with Alimta 8.3 months compared to a mean of 7.9 months at docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in whom the cancer did not attack the squamous cells showed longer survival compared to the comparison drug in the administration of Alimta.</seg>

<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion for a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the Pemetrexed- Infusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as an intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid will be given on the day before and on the day of the Pemetremixed-Gabe, as well as on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of pemetremixed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) a week before the first Pemetremixed dose and after each third session cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving Pemetremixed, a full blood pattern should be created before each administration, including differentiation of leukocytes and platelet count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanin-Transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose examination must take place under consideration of the Nadir of the blood balance or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the previous therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After the recovery, patients must be treated according to indications in tables 1, 2 and 3 that are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Level 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-haematological toxicity ≥ Grad 3 (excluding neuro-toxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value prior to treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be stopped if in patients after 2 dose reductio- an haematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so- continues with the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that at the age of 65 years or above, patients at the age of 65 have increased side effects risk.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data about harmlessness and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dose adaptations recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin-clearance of less than 45 ml / min was insufficient; therefore, the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver dysfunction of &gt; the 1.5-fold upper bilirubin- limit value and / or transaminase values of &gt; to the 3.0-fold of the upper limit value (in case of liver metastasis) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value (for the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically investigated in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with respect to bone marl immunosuppression and Pemetremixed should not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophils again reach a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte number again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dose reduction for other cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutrophils, thrombocyte number and maximum non-hematological toxicity observed in previous courses of treatment (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 haematological and non-haematological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was beechoed when pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetremixed need to be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce toxic toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal insufficiency (Creatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid taking non-steroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days before the therapy, at least 2 days after therapy with pemetremixed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients for which a therapy with pemetremixed is foreseen must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetremixed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had the appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">For this reason, a drainage of the effusion before pemetremixed treatment should be considered in patients with clinically significant fluid retention in transcellular space.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 Major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with pemetremixed, if this active ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic drug.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated live vaccine (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible harm to the reproductive capacity is due to pemetremixed, men should be advised before the treatment ginn to obtain advice regarding the sperm containment.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage (≥ 1.3 g daily) can result in reduced Pemetremixed elimination with the result of increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">It is therefore advisable to apply high doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses in patients with normal kidney function (Cretan Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy, should be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetremixed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data concerning the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous use with pemetremixed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetre- mixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The intra-individual variability of coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Regulated Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for using pemetremixed in pregnant women, but as with ande- or antimetabolites severe birth defects are expected in the pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetremixed should not be used during pregnancy except if it is mandatory and after careful consideration of benefits for the mother and the risk of fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity is due to pemetremixed, men should be advised before the start of treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm containment.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether pemetremixed is transferred to breast milk and undesirable effects on the breastfed baby can not be excluded.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetremixed) is an antineoplastic antifolate that exerts its effect by interrupting important folate-dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetremixed acts as antitorate with several points of attack by blocking the thymidylate synthase (TS), Dihydrofolatreduktase (GARFT), the key enzymes of the de novo Biosynthesis of Thymid- and Purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, simple-blind phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus cisplatin against cisplatin in chemonaive patients with malignant pleural othelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically meaningful advantage compared to those patients who were treated with cisplatin only.</seg>

<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single-meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a treatment with alli, because the dosage of the anti-diabetic drug may be adjusted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adjusted.</seg>

<seg id="2521">In a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin, lowering of the Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">When applying Warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-values (international norm-rated ratio, INR) could be affected (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and the beta carotene remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take an additional multivitamin supplement before bedtime in order to ensure adequate vitamin intake (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the administration of a one-time Amiodarone, a small number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time observed a minor decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal and are related to the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of ingested fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rarely (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of known side effects that have been detected after the launch of orlistat is unknown since these events have been reported voluntarily by a population of uncertain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to dilemmas with regard to possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg of orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and overweight patients over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The majority of cases reported after the launch of orlistat overdosing have either reported no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on investigations on humans and animals, a rapid regression of possible systemic effects deriving from orlistat's lisuited properties can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect sets in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active Serin-Rest of the gastric and pankreatic lipass.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies have derived 60 mg of orlistat, taken three times a day, which blocks absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies on adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat taken three times a day in combination with a hypokalical, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was evaluated as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a percentage of those who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the Gesamtcholesterin was with orlistat 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (initial value: 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg / 3.5% with orlistat (baseline 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (baseline: 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">The average change of waist measurement was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting point 103.7 cm) and placebo -3.6 cm (baseline 103,5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable for 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7. in general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma was only sporadic in plasma and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lacton ring) and M3 (M1 after splitting of the N-shaped leucine group), were identified in a study with obese patients, which represented nearly 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as for chemotherapies, the moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an antipsychotic medication).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there are not enough information for the effects of this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong or moderate symptoms for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In the event of chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">Chemotherapy, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting showed that 81% of patients treated with Aloxi were not vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd., for the marketing of Aloxi in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi to prevent nausea and vomiting induced by strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with amnesty obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be monitored closely after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is required with simultaneous use of palonosetron with medicines that prolong the QT interval or in patients where the QT interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi will not be used in the days following chemotherapy neither to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, palonosetron did not inhibit tumour-oriented activity of the five chemotherapeutic agents studied (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, Cycloabin, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">A clinical study showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single IV dose of palonosetron and a steady state concentration oral metoclogists, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 Inhibitors (Amiodarone, Celecoxib, Chlorpromazine, Cimetidine, Paroxetine, Chinidine, Ranitidine, Ritonavir, Sertraline and Terbinafin) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences concerning the use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not present, therefore Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events were reported at a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which were at least possibly associated with Aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the location (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-active relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were performed, but due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably not an effective therapy with an overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies a total of 1.132 patients receiving a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and 250 micrograms or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were received intravenously on day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study a total of 667 patients who received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine and 250 or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of ondansetron that were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of study with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarised in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials of indication-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval were comparable to the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Following clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular degeneration and repolarization and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The study conducted in 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the ECG-effects of palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations, a slow elimination from the body with an average terminale half-life time of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the surface below the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are usually dose-proportionally in the entire dose range of 0.30,90 μ / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Following intravenous palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in palonosetron plasma concentrations measured at 11 testicular carcinoma between day 1 and day was 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations show that the daily intravenous dose of 0.25 mg palonosetron was comparable to 3 consecutive days (AUC-∞) with the value measured after one-off intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the Cmax was higher after the setting of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated through the kidneys and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, to lesser extent, the Isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in palonosetron metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 mcg / kg [14C] -palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron as unaltered drug made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Following a single-time intravenous injection for healthy eyes, the total body was between 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal clearances 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although the terminale exclusion period and the average systemic exposure to palonosetron are increased in patients with severe liver dysfunction, however, a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic exposure, indicating low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From preclinical studies, indications have shown that palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular degeneration and repolarisation and can prolong the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosetron (each dose corresponded to about 30 times the therapeutic exposure in humans) that were given daily over two years led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine Neoplasms (in thyroid gland, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marks) and skin tumours in rats, but not mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is determined by humans for a unique application, the relevance of these results is regarded as low for the human being.</seg>
<seg id="2649">The owner of this approval for the placing on the market must inform the European Commission about the plans for placing the medicine approved within the framework of this decision.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative report, in which the approval of approval for the marketing of the treatment provided for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alphe6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same medicinal ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also known as" "" "reference medicinal products" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease called by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In the case of a microscopic investigation the liver tissue damage, and also the values of the liver enzyme Alanin aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood abnormally be increased.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) is introduced into which it stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Alpheon, the manufacturer of Alpheon, presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy of hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference doctor in 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after treatment (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged What are the biggest concerns the CHMP has caused the recommendation to prohibit the marketing authorization?</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns were voiced that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed cannot suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease increased again in more patients than with the reference physician; furthermore, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the question to what extent the drug triggers an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of impetigo (a skin infection accompanied by crust formation) and small infected infirmiations (cracking or cutting wounds), abrasions and sewed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been demonstrably or presumably caused by methicillinseed Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because of this type of infection potentially does not work.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine, but for patients under 18 years of age, the area to be treated may not exceed 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) thereby inhibiting the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 patients (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients (placebo) responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected Hautwins, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together in the skin, about 90% of patients from both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (egg-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that have been proven or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation to the contracting body.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo were outweighed in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections compared to the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmities, abrasions or sewed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Ltd. Ltd., approving the market launch of Altargo in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of a sensitization or serious local irritation by the use of retapamination ointment, treatment should be aborted, the ointment is carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection will begin.</seg>
<seg id="2687">It should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as a pathogen or is suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">The efficacy of reapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient in clinical studies of secondary open wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered, if after a 2 to 3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected passage occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The impact of simultaneous use of retinapululin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations which have been reached on the skin or infected surface wounds after topical application, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo cannot be expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of ketoconazole the middle reapamination AUC (0-24) and Cmax increased after topical application of 1% retapamination ointment on skimed skin of healthy adult males by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosage adjustments are not considered necessary if topical reapamination is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral ingestion and are insufficient in relation to a statement affecting the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin's ointment should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of reapamulin is preferable to the application of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether breastfeeding should be continued or terminated with Altargo, it is advisable to weigh between the benefits of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for women.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that Altargo had applied was the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the location, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly pleurotropus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of action of retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site of ribosomal protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P binding site and the peptide transfer center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, pandromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, block partially P-binding and prevents the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of reapamulin may appear questionable at least some forms of infection, consultation should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences were found in the in vitro activity of reapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin ointment was applied daily under occlusion to intact and on skinned skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% retapamination ointment twice daily for 5 days for the topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling procedure took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, maximum individual systemic intake in humans after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 of deported skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro-oxidative metabolism of reapaminulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies of oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro examination of gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in mice lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats microkernel test for in vivo investigation of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dosage of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, resulting in up to 5 times higher exposure as the highest estimated exposure in humans (topical application on 200 cm2 of deported skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats were diagnosed with oral dosage of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to ≥ 3-fold of the estimated human exposure (see above)), development toxicity (reduced body weight of foetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of approval for placing on the market must ensure that a pharmaccovigilance system, as presented in the 1.8.1 module of the authorisation application (version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner agrees to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in Version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP), as well as all additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Human Use," the updated RMP will also be submitted with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms on the treated spot show you should quit the application of Altargo and talk with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not use any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo unless prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">When the ointment gets out of sight on one of these surfaces, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment you can cover the affected area with a sterile federation or a gazebo unless your doctor has advised you to not cover the area.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is available in an aluminium tube with a plastic closure that contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in an aluminum bag containing 0.5 g of ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix will be used as part of a two-dose vaccination plan, and a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix must be used only if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while immunization, and it is ensured that the vaccination plan consisting of two doses can be terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is against hepatitis A or B, ambient or other hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by contributing to the immune system (the natural defence of the body), as it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "foreign" "" "and produces antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the inoculated vaccine Twinrix Adults and the Vaccine of Twinrix since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however, as part of a vaccination plan existing from three doses, both adults and children are given children.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinet adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix Adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for efficacy was the percentage of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injections.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix performed between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children one month after the last injections for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambirix's degree of protection was similar to six and a 12 month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, matchiness (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to the active ingredients, one of the other constituents or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for priming with Ambirix is made up of two doses of vaccines, the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is given between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster for hepatitis A and hepatitis B is desired, vaccines or combination vaccine may be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) have been observed in the same order as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured that immunocompetent persons, who have addressed a hepatitis C vaccination, need a refresher vaccination as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory even with no more detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate treatment and monitoring options should be immediately available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the injection of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine, containing 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of haemodialysis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAVs and anti-HBs antibody levels after the priming phase, so that in these cases the administration of additional doses may be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intramuscular injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal success in the gluteal muscles, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In case of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, Ambirix may, however, be injected subcutaneously since it can result in bleeding in these cases after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix was administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection with a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, azellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects it may be assumed that an adequate immune response may not be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matrimony, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever was similar to the frequency observed in the previous thiomer and preservative vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 doses were administered on a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 up to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants aged 12 and including 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and matchiness on a calculation basis per accination dose Ambirix, but not based on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix in 50,7% of the subjects compared to 39.1% of the subjects after the dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle reported 66.4% of the subjects that had been given to the Ambirix, about pain, compared to 63.8% of the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matrimony was comparable to per proband (i.e., over the entire vaccine cycle at 39.6% of subjects receiving Ambiani compared to 36.2% of subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and matridity was low and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year-olds, the presence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirian group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, there was a frequency of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per prop.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The percentage of vaccines that reported serious adverse events during the 2-dose vaccination diagram with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to 15 years, the Seroconversion rates for anti-HAV 99,1% were one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- and including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combinant vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 persons, whose immunogenicity was worthless, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in month 2 and 6 were significantly higher than with Ambirix after 3-dose vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses that were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 year-olds one month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="2766">Both studies received either a 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of priming, persistence of anti-HAVs and anti-HBs antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study against both antigens was comparable to that found after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial at 12- and including 15-year-olds, it was shown that the persistence of anti-HAVs and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme to that in the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix was administered at the same time with the freshening of a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, azellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults demonstrated similar seroprotection and seroconversion rates as for earlier formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine must be examined both before and after the resusencode for any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may necessitate stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix cannot protect itself completely from infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series with 2 doses has been completed.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is already infected with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vaccines / is (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the point of vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections caused by the liver or causing symptoms similar to those after hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ambient or any component of this vaccine, including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction may be caused by itchy skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B, if you / your child has a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the usual scheduled dose of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">In case of a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child of vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / she will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of active ingredients per inoculation dose (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of active ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccination protection prior to the end of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix will be injected to people who suffer from severe blood clotting disorders, under the skin and not into the muscle. • If you / your child is weakened by illness or treatment in your / its body defense, or if you / your child is undergoing a hematalysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals on vaccination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines / takes medication (including those you can get without prescription) or if you / your child have been vaccinated recently, or have been given immunoglobulins (antibodies) or have been planned or planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated at separate spots and as different extremities as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix will not be given pregnant or lactating women, unless it is urgently needed to be vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix request inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the appointment scheduled for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and make an appointment as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">♦ A very often (more than 1 case per 10 inoculated doses): • pain or discomfort on the insertion site or redness • Matching • irritability • headache • loss of appetite</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which have become known since the first approval for the placing on the market, the CHMP has assumed that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambiani was only brought into circulation in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited because of the limited number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in patients over a month with a complete enzymatic defect or with hyperammonic encephalopathy (brain damage following high ammonia concentrations) in pre-history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonschnaps - split into several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed with the food or administered via a gastropod (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study since Ammonaps could not be compared to another treatment or placebo (a pseudo-drug, that is, without drug).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonaps may also result in loss of appetite, abnormal acidification in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disorders or taste sac, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammontaps in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevented high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonaps was approved in" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "because due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval, only limited information on this drug was available." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients, in which a complete enzyme shortage has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifest form (incomplete enzymatic defect that manifests itself after the first month of life), there is an indication of the use if a hyperammonia encephalopathy exists in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein absorption needed for the patient's growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbambooatsynthetase or ornithinaris bamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with swallowing disorders, as there is a risk for the formation of esophusulzera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, respectively 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as in clinical conditions associated with sodium retention and odema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat occurs over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in pregnant women is unknown; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats at high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), there was a slowdown in neuronal proliferation and increased neurons loss.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed ripening of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a hindrance to the brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be ascertained whether phenylacetate is excreted by humans into breast milk, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at least 56% of patients had at least an adverse event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events had assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed metabolic Encephalopathy in combination with lacacacidosis, severe hypokalemia, curb topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred in a 5-month-old infant with an inadvertent dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are accompanied by the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose limiting neurotoxicity when administered intravenous doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound that conjugates to phenylacetylglutamine by acetylation, which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stoichiometrically, Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); therefore phenylacetylglutamine is suitable as alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram taken sodium phenylbutyrat between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately to improve the chances of survival and the clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of first symptoms in newborns was almost always infant, and the disease itself led to death even in the treatment of peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hematalysis, the utilization of alternative routes of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn at postpartal (but within the first life month) diagnosed diseases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy and who were previously treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonia encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it occurred with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygotic form of the Ornithintranscarbamylase deficiency) who recovered from a hyperammonia encephalopathy and subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in the case of treatment and in some patients a further worsening of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in the liver and kidneys enzymatic with glutamine, whereby phenylacetylglutamine arises.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after administration of a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after intravenous use of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected 15 minutes after intake.</seg>
<seg id="2846">After various doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) the majority of patients with uric cykline or haemoglobinopathies found no phenylacetate in plasma after nightly fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">Three out of six patients with cirrhosis of the liver were treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted within 24 hours to about 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the Micronucleus test results, sodium phenylbutyrat no longer treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is either taken orally (infants and children who can not swallow tablets or swallowing patients with swallowing disorders) or by a gastropod or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (in particular branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum protein in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbambooatsynthetase or ornithinaris bamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrat, respectively 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, corresponding to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat flutes were exposed to phenylacetate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrat) before birth, there were lesions in the pyramid cells of the cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed metabolic Encephalopathy in combination with lacacacidosis, severe hypokalemia, curb topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Stoichiometrically, Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); therefore phenylacetylglutamine is suitable as alternative carrier for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of studies on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle it can be assumed that the sodium phenylbutyl can be produced for each gram between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in the case of treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in granular form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected 15 minutes after intake.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the shelf life the patient can retain the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">The small measuring spoon contains 0,95 g, the medium measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the drug over a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after the consumption of proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If lab tests are carried out, you must tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, as sodium phenylbutyrat may affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used for the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example with unstable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "static lifting" (an anomalous measured value in the electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who subtract a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients suffering from angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of Angiox was compared with conventional combination or in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa-inhibitor (GPI, another medicine to prevent blood clots) with the conventional combination treatment with heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patient often used a stent (a short tube which remains in the artery to prevent a closure), and they also received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without the use of GPI - in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or reascularization) after 30 days or a year overall as effective as the conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI, Angiox was as effective in regards to all indicators as heparin, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against bidjudin, other hirudine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who have recently had bleeding, as well as people with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable substitute for heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the Medicines Company UK Ltd approval of the launch of Angiox across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina / non-ST lifting infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or if early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended starting dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous injection of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed subsequently, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">An injection of 0.5 mg / kg should be given immediately prior to the procedure followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous injection of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intravenous intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of any Bolus administration by Angiox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT, after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second release of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT results, the reconstituted and diluted drug should be carefully mixed before use and the tightening dose should be administered intravenously intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer necessary, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">For patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with bidvalidation against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1,4 mg. / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second dose of the bolt will be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage included in phase III- PCI trial (REPLACE-2), which were included in the approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the bivalirudin-Bolus without dose adaptation at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also for patients with dialysis, Angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intravenous administration of heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of low-molecular heparin.</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if the majority of the bleeding in the arterial point of points occur in the case of PCI patients, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may occur everywhere during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are using warfarin and treated with bivalirudin, monitoring of the INR value (International Regulated Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after the treatment with bidredin reaches the level before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocytes) it can be assumed that these drugs increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalirudin with thrombocytes aggregations or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemodynamics parameters in each case are monitored regularly.</seg>

<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Biedrudin group and in the patients treated with Heparin, women and patients over the age of 65 were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding has been defined in accordance with the ACUITY and Timi scales for severe bleeding like in the footnotes of table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleeding were significantly less common among bivalidatine than in the groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and bivalidrudine plus GPIIb / IIIa- or inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or hemorrhage in the point of puncture, reduction of the haemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known bleeding station, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>

<seg id="2922">In the case of overdosing, the treatment with biobtoid is immediately broken off and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalidatine, a direct and specific thread inhibitor which binds both the catalytic center and the anion region of thrombin irrespective of whether thrombine is bound in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Biedrudin to Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin, on its part, slowly splits the binding of Biedrudin-ARG3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active center of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Moreover, bidagocyte-induced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) could not induce thrombocyte aggregation.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes who require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm or administered as a continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a condition in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or the insulin cannot be processed effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from acting insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where the body cannot work effectively, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was found after six months compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin lispro.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% at human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lsin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the transfer of Apidra to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall, thigh or delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of abdominal muscles.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Because of the reduced glucose-ogenesis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change in effect, the brand (producers), the type of insulin (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can change the insulin requirement.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dosing or termination of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin produced by another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time for the occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change during the treatment of the treatment regimen.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, pentoxifyllin, propoxyphene, salizylates and sulfonamide-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of liking agents such as beta blockers, clonidin, Guanethidin and reserpine, the symptoms of adrenergic antiregulation can be weakened or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to the pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lysine enters human breast milk, but in general insulin does not enter the breast milk nor is it resorbed after oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">In the following, the adverse drug trials known from clinical studies are sorted by system-organ classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100; rarely ≥ 1 / 100; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on the available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold sweat, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, dizziness, excessive dog, changes of vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy If iramed to continuously change the injection point within the injection area, a lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by means of an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) administered by a correspondingly trained person, or by intravenous injection of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After gluing the patient, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (in particular by skeletal muscles and fat) and by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin, the impact occurs quicker and the active duration is shorter than for cou- manlike normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin lulisin in the therapeutically relevant dosage range from 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a dose of proportional glucosal effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a subproportional increase in the glucosal effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lulisin has a twice as fast acting as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosal effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was apparent that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post-prandiale glycaemic control is reached as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin plisin was taken 2 minutes before the meal, a better postprandial control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin plisin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a similar glycaemic control is achieved as with human normal insulin, which is given 2 mi- grooves before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin by offering 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal was given in comparison to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to a human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin by offering 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal in comparison to human Nor- malacting, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (figure 1C).</seg>
