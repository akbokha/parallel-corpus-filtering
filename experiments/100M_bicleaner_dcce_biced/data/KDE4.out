the package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite their small size , they offer some extra features and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them available easier .
more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the Guide to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Set@@ ting Exten@@ sions .... Check the Tools tab and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard Settings modules from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that possibly more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extras crashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if present .
the module An@@ gle Filter ( also called Ord@@ inary Filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Menu bar under Extras address filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the currently displayed page . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : docum@@ ent@@ Item , all other nodes are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides an additional view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different toolbar and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of graphi@@ cally represented ne@@ sted order hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose area is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the size of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily detected even if it is far below in the folder hierarchy . consequently , &amp; FS@@ View may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command .
in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rect@@ angles possess meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can either display depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or image of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify if it is displayed at all , only if there is enough room for representation or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles is to be used ( whereby therefore display errors may occur due to constraints on the mark of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the label in the rect@@ angle .
with Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , it should be observed that the area is propor@@ tionally related to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always observed . frames need space , which is no longer available to subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square .
the implementation of the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this case , it is always advantageous for the lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses by frame to create rect@@ angles that are as square as possible . the best methods in this respect are rows , columns or recur@@ sive division .
you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry via the menu entry View View on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the Image Gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras picture gallery ... or by C@@ trl ; I .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into digital cameras . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , every medium and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing ; working together .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , rate and correct your photos . editing capabilities can easily be expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins Configuration interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; easy to use , dozens of professional capabilities are available . it works complete in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; over the camera or lens to be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . you should therefore report any problems and opportunities for improvement .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; try to report any problems or suggestions for them as easily as possible . wherever you are in the program , the help menu contains an entry problems or wishes .... This opens a dialog with a under@@ lined link@@ age . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . all required information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that means , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; ask and hopefully soon even answer questions of other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ kam ; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to join &amp; digi@@ plug ; to participate , registration is in the developer mailing list . instruction to report in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you start &amp; Edit ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . you can enter here a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you will need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data is saved . this path will be the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &amp; Edit ; will additionally be used as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images as the base folder . &amp; Edit ; looks at each sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed .
&amp; Edit ; En@@ dur@@ es recur@@ sively the library path in its full depth . you can &apos;t close any sub@@ folders unless it i@@ ste in hidden folder . this can be done by setting a point before the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ti@@ list do not have any photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put this on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , it can be edited and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; possibly also b@@ yp@@ assing it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported Roh@@ cameras in the Help menu support .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the section Ro@@ h @-@ Decoder Options and Ro@@ h work@@ flows .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into digital cameras . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , every medium and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing ; working together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras supporting an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos generally are large files and transfers over the serial port are slow , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images using g@@ Photo@@ 2 . see this link for a complete list of supported cameras .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ K@@ am can be read reliably . the Ex@@ if support is needed by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators to read the thumb@@ nails . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not be able to see preview images or the generation could be very slow .
one of the nic@@ est things to digi@@ ti@@ ze is how easy it is to extend its functionality through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plugin interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing ; , K@@ Photos Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes came in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; self @-@ made .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode using F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag and drop images works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the tree , using the horizontal divi@@ der line or in another application window . the only restriction is that you can &apos;t put a picture in keywords , date list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to choose the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . so the filter functions on the filen@@ ame only if it is displayed in the symbol view . which fields are displayed you can configure in the dialog of the default settings .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos edited by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders where they were stored on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ istics tab or after the date on which the album was first created .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . just select Import Photos to record album . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the destination album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . you can also move or copy several photos in the same way . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
Alb@@ um@@ - Coll@@ ections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can group under a common name . the collection you use will be used to sort your photos , if you want to select Home collection from the toolbar or view albums After the collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums By date .
the El@@ der , A@@ verage , New Year &apos;s buttons : these set the date to the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . this first attempts to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file in this folder is used instead .
when you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this should help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you have to click the image with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; When album preview app@@ en@@ quot ; select . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be contained in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list at the bottom left of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images will be displayed in this album in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these thumb@@ nails with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the toolbar .
when opening an album for the first time , you need to wait a bit while the preview images are generated . you can avoid this by using the Tools Show all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information about each image will be displayed below the associated preview . what information is , you can edit and customize settings . select the Albums tab here and customize the preview images to suit your needs .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear , when you let the mouse poin@@ ter rest a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the section Intro@@ duction to the main window displays such a help window .
photos are all about it &amp; digi@@ kam ; works . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the image processing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these . you can view all the features that came with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing ; you can choose between viewing images , slide show or editing images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by right @-@ clicking on F@@ 4 Image ... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and selecting Edit ... . in the Edit menu , you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos .
it can happen that &amp; Edit ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by right @-@ clicking the context menu and selecting the program from the File Type sub@@ menu . to do this , and how to customize it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing other image editing programs , there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture , etc .
&amp; Edit ; provides two options for rotation . the simplest one is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select Rot@@ ate . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you will retain the extension ( .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you have a photo taken from &amp; Edit ; Del@@ ete , it is moved to the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del if you rather want to delete it , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ eli@@ ste@@ quot ; organizes your photos according to the data . &amp; Edit ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are displayed in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date screen so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed .
photos with keywords provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a cue is assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search again .
when a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be shown .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to lo@@ gically organize your keywords . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ wor@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and allocated key word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . you can also use your tags in other programs as well . in addition , the keywords are re @-@ imported when the database is lost , as soon as &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the pictures are noticed .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this will be the sub@@ stit@@ ch of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by right @-@ clicking on the keyword and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by dra@@ gging it to the desired position in the tree and leaving there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to shift the keyword . a keyword can be only once in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking it and selecting keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you have to click the image with the right mouse button and select as the album title in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to make use of the functionality with keywords , you first need to add keywords . this can be done in two ways : once you select the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords . alternatively , you can also right @-@ click on the thumb@@ nails of the images and select keyword alphabe@@ tically from the context menu .
you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the key words assigned to him . in this way you can give a cue for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this is displayed under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can right @-@ click the context menu of the photos and select Remove from the Tags menu . the menu only shows the keywords that have been assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ dependent read@@ ability hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection box can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you just have to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection frame indicating the time unit . this will display all the associated images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will then appear in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
next to the search box is a small lamp the green is displayed when the search finds matches . if you click here , the filter will be deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search has found nothing , then the lamp becomes red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this you will see a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search that always filters what you entered as search criteria . after you have saved it , it appears filter in the list .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and the search will be executed . the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window . the Text box Save search is used to assign your request a name to my search list . if you want to change your selection after searching again , you just need to select the corresponding entry from the My search list and select an option in its context menu .
when you select Search Edit , the search form will appear again with the previously entered search information . if you select Exp@@ anded Search , the Advanced Search dialog appears to change your previous search . you will find more information in the Advanced Search tool section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete Search in the context menu .
advanced Search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules are displayed time @-@ wise , separated by operators . an option can be added to this list using the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... , No ... or At least ... You can search for Type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; characterized every picture by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this makes it possible to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two signatures , the more they correspond to each other . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any image to find a similar one . by using a sponge , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free hand @-@ drawn sketch : draw a quick sketch and to@@ ast ; finds the matching pic@@ s . here too , a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it . move it while you press the left mouse button . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to draw a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o @-@ filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides a lamp table in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L Add the lamp table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lamp table and its window opened . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; main window , you can quickly open the lamp table with L Extras illuminated table .
from the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right corner of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you select Pre@@ view from the toolbar and perform a zoo or move operations on one of the pictures , then you will compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of pictures . if you navigate p@@ airing mode from the toolbar , the first two images will be automatically loaded into the areas to compare . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to view it in the right pane . this simplifies working through a series of similar pictures .
of course , the normal soldering actions work directly from the light table like e.g. F@@ 4 file processing ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the illuminated table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to pi@@ v@@ ot the visible range of the image , you have to click it and press the &amp; L@@ MB ; hold down . in Mode Pre@@ view both images will display the same image area .
the zoom works just like in other views . just use the zoom sli@@ der under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this is done in both pictures if you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital inventory management - away from the fashion ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been made until final output and permanent storage . each of the photos absor@@ bs , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to back up your pictures , find , protect and use photos again . we focus on the procedures for digital photographer the &amp; digi@@ kam ; use . we review the download , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , group , backup , evaluate , dup@@ licate , archive , optimize , maintain and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management records , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ ection and exports contents which have a monetary or cultural value quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is , according to your definition , data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need no longer to find a specific photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use not &amp; digi@@ ti@@ te ; . the approach can save metadata both in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving , which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you have to decide if you want to have other access to your photos , whether you want to save them to a private drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure that you have to switch to a bigger drive at some point .
you might be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found about your location unless you were in a year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export . then export a folder for images you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new ones from old files .
the separation of original and work files simplifies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know whether you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend that you save metadata in the Metad@@ ata Settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently store the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding item in the Album View menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change them ? set &amp; Edit ; give them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , as you should now assign keywords , labels and a rating to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then . this makes sense , as you can focus on the best photos when further work is done .
let &apos;s talk with keywords , keywords , as you often refer to other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically set up the tree for you or insert images to the right place . converting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by moving a sub @-@ tree to another .
the graph shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very crude representation as each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . filen@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
most people don &apos;t want to let anybody see your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dre@@ aming to have associations , memories , the historical time span is once again present , you may even hear the silence . so the inscription has changed your perception of this panorama completely .
for others who consider your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to generate an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help him about the subject you moved has to understand what you understand .
it is al@@ right if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; Edit , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as a label . K@@ DE even provides you with a spell ch@@ ecker . if you export your images in web galleries , then these labels will be exported to your wishes in the label and / or the title of the web gallery system .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the move of the spatial presentation already drives with speed of light .
the possibilities to utili@@ se ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will become deeper in the future . I &apos;m sure that some@@ day , in the near future , you can virtually rep@@ licate your travels by images with geographical indications . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; can also export c@@ ml files you can open with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps Viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all modified versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you which information on the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for producers and authors ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the photographer &apos;s name , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , the name of a company or organization can be used .
author title : linked to the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s work description . examples for this can be title as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others . if the image is a stock photo , then here the group / agency that offers the image here .
it is very important to popul@@ ate the author and copyright sections although they do not offer protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or change this image embedded in the image . for private persons , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
digital water@@ mark is unique in each image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire . these types of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it &apos;s about problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery firm , has some interesting statistics , which causes data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , they need to be treated carefully and you can no longer trust them than a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ val quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and storing them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if you have just written . that &apos;s why they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for faulty CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format warfare against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs is also true for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
slow down with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . then read the data again to verify you . likewise , you should copy the media with a description , date &amp; author and then copy to a clean , dark dry and protected spot . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves . their manufacturers &apos; warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : disk error study
the most common error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT , is the most common error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect these errors . some of the errors identified by S@@ MA@@ RT show the im@@ min@@ ent failure . this is in particular read errors and publisher counter@@ s . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the total losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems .
while most electric devices do not make a lot of power , it looks different from devices with computer chips and high speed processes . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage . protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able loss of time and money .
the most common protection against power spi@@ kes is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . remember , however , that not every male connector also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection then you should make sure that it complies with the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also be careful that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices .
as an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system should also be protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage cont@@ actors , which also have a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a wear@@ able over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . thus , you are ideal for on the go .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in un@@ interrupted power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically supply battery energy when a power failure occurs . some models allow you to save your data and run the system in order . if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the cost of avoiding these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to 6 euro ; a low price difference if you consider how well your computer is using it . at the end , you should always remember to clean all the cables before going into the holiday .
the Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive on &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Shared Storage is another popular offering you can store any amount of data .
you are in comparison to the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data over the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures at full resolution online . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited storage , which should be checked in reality first .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory in the offer .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the calcul@@ ator . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs file system ensure at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive .
the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all of these disrup@@ tions remain un@@ discovered until you some@@ day open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of data transfer losses , as they create inter@@ ferences inside the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that can deal with disk errors at low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon also be available for Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % on the work@@ station systems .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it causes less damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ F@@ s and X@@ FS to name the broad@@ est file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been fully saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft , and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are located 1 @-@ 2 stops of aperture from fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result more deterior@@ ated . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk drive you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so make no anyone responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by a data loss . so , backup your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous as the re@@ installation of your operating system , changing disks or resi@@ zing disks .
suppose you make daily your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash hit you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget the aircraft gap : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or something like that .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as already said above , a common reason for a data loss despite back up the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
full backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
diff@@ user protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot of two times : the complete backup and the last difference security .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original state at any time on which such a backup was made . this backup comes with a version system closest to the exception that is only scann@@ ed and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that were really changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
save important pictures directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other visual media .
this approach lets you get enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time you come up for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review .
themes : metadata , IP@@ TC stored in the image file , retain associated X@@ MP files , retain memory , scal@@ ability , media , recover images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing , ... , use of the Internet .
in order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you need to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while time is passing . unfortunately , there is no other possibility than to leave a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . the less variants you used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future .
this question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document . do not use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and f@@ uses , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have included the scal@@ ability with the plan and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate it to a new disk :
check with the d@@ mes@@ g command if your new disk was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; disk size works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ ide / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of the disk if needed
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
PNG is designed as an open source standard that should replace GIF . it can save much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . PNG can recommend g@@ amma and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignments in hetero@@ geneous platforms .
TIFF has been widely used as a picture format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm ( default ) . however , with some cameras you can save your images in this format . however , a problem is that this format is adapted by many people . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open frame format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG was developed based on the TIFF / EP format and required to use met@@ a data . a handful of camera manufacturers are already available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it some@@ time .
this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image Resource block quot ; technology of the 1990s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; it is a coding technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file themselves . the file information is saved with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ m@@ quot ; stores the XML / R@@ DF file .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP works as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , there can be problems with the link between the metadata file and the image file and as mentioned above , the raw format is old . therefore , you should consider whether you are using D@@ NG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ C@@ MI include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to reach a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them to your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for a fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing you can use external programs . if you edited the images again with &amp; Edit , then you should add the metadata again . these were possibly truncated by the other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them in web galleries , encoding in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; see section Add a photo to an album you will be able to add a description on how to add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ Database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; connect it to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on . you can find another description in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it attempts to connect to your camera . for some cameras it can take a while . if the connection is made , a he@@ el indicator appears at the bottom end and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side@@ bars features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the Metad@@ ata tab displays internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , Manufacturer notices , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata page bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of All . this invites all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . when downloading , the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired ones using the default selection methods from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and download Sel@@ ected . the Sel@@ ected button is extracted until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New Download is available . these images have not been edited by &amp; digi@@ kam . in this case the new images are marked with an ast@@ er@@ isk in the preview window . if you select this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
when you use the All Download or Sel@@ ected buttons , a dialog will appear where you can select the destination album in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Albums section . then select the destination album from the list and click OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; Edit ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at one time by using the Del@@ ete All Del@@ ete button . if you just want to delete some , you have to select them first and then delete the selected ones .
please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . the photos will not be moved to the garbage dump of &amp; k@@ de ; you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded in a &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed album before you delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera system completely , you should do so via the camera mount , since this is much faster .
the file names are normally recycled after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can lead to double file names , if you load photos from different recording galleries into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been taken into the file name .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created per day automatically .
the first two relate the data about the author in the section Standard car identity . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you prefer a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % d % d : % M : % S for example in the edit field . to do so , turn on the option Date &amp; Time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the option camera filen@@ ame , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters when you download them . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ kam ; used for a photo is displayed below the name the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic turn while downloading . not all cameras provide this information . in the Metad@@ ata section , you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic turn is normally switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , it can be digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the Automatic rotation in the bottom of the window .
when your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made , it can be used to automatically create sub albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a data section you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off and digi@@ ti@@ sed in this case ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn on this option . to do so , use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file using the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you where the images should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select here the desired folder and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position specified in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and which can be displayed on a map . the identification of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatically recording the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was made , you can click on a browser to display the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , user who can loc@@ alize the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to store the posi@@ tional data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ing and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , via a re@@ working of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical allocation ( manual ) and last via the manual entry of known places .
as far as we know there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
download the GPS data from one device can be done using g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to save these data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the geographic allocation module .
there are several programs for Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same on &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ tool by Phi@@ l Harv@@ ey . it uses the del@@ im@@ ited co @-@ ordin@@ ates that are generated by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle for example .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; Edit ; tries to give you as much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that have the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you must select setting up . the settings dialog is sub@@ divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left .
select Action can be set to a saved preview or start image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; determine if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright information . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author title is a syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line : this field should include the photographer &apos;s professional name . this may be a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a closer description of the author , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for vendors : use this field to specify the one that the photo offers . this does not have to be the author , if it works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations should be listed here . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC field . this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the data base of &amp; digi@@ kam ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited and edited without getting lost .
save image cap@@ tions as embedded labels ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . thus , your cap@@ tions can also be read by other picture viewers .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information appearing when the mouse cursor is placed in the main window above a file . depending on the option selected , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; Edit ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam , then you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . any file in one &amp; digi@@ kam ; album folders that will not have any of these extensions , by &amp; digi@@ kam ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
these settings can be set to the default values on this page . however , every time you open the illuminated table these settings are switched on . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In all image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; you should only use on fast computers . if you have one then you can get better viewing results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can switch off the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture . these colors are set here . in image processing , this View Mode can be switched on and off using F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more information .
with PNG compression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality , since PNG requires a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression .
with the option to comp@@ ress TIFF files , you can turn on the default compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no effect on image quality , since the default algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the L@@ oss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is much better than at normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in planning .
in earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is quickly evolving into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing .
the standard assumption is that all green pixels are the same . if the upright green pixels of the CCD sensor respond more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd rows , this difference creates a lat@@ tice pattern in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option draws the image a bit soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed color balance based on a white card photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed pictures get more details in four steps . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the default is the pointed @-@ lights , so the parts of your images that are burned @-@ in , because of the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights as per@@ pen@@ di@@ cular white . use the setting colors create some unusual results as they show the pointed lights in various ro@@ ses . finally , you can attempt to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast satur@@ ate as green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
when choosing the option of re@@ constructing , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be adjusted separately for each picture .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it a bit higher than the default 1 . this can also be done later in the frame options of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Image editing . to keep the time for the demo icing small , you should go conserv@@ atively .
a demo @-@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests , it looks like this . V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it produces color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method of color gra@@ ding , since it is performed during the pipe conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and gives instructions how to return it . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information like the colour information of a color space can be translated into the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Questions , when an image is opened in image editing / Color management module with raw files start .
color Profile folder Set here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you can save all your profiles .
settings of ICC profiles You have here the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed later when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your images color managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should match the camera operator and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , like e.g. Canon , which does not contain any color @-@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma doesn &apos;t correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to change the color @-@ mapping itself .
there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your image would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors are therefore very sati@@ ated . this could you manually correct instead of rely on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for . unfortunately , not on the models of Canon . therefore , here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the goal : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by providing this interface can &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these are then edited by &amp; Edit . these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short instructions for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Sh@@ ort@@ cuts .
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ in@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the slide show settings should be easy to understand . the upper regulator adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes turn the metadata into or out which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad .
the camera features on the left hand side a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right @-@ hand side a button auto detection exists which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , turned on and in image display mode . below are the port settings . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / box where you mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn it on .
check if &amp; edit ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the confirmation dialog box for moving &gt; Images in the M@@ ül@@ bin@@ s , you can set the dialog from &amp; Edit ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you can find more details in the del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album .
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be sil@@ ently edited by &amp; Edit ; if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries , otherwise you need to save the changes with the button Chan@@ ges .
you can also add the display of the welcome screen of &amp; Edit ; prevent when starting . this may ha@@ sten the start process of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ te ; .
the setting When starting to search for new photos forces &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zes ; scan the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this length@@ ens the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if anything was deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; you see if it should delete them from the database .
different color schemes can be edited in &amp; Out ; used to customize the main window to suit your taste . these settings can be selected from the toolbar settings . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about it in this tutorial .
&amp; Edit ; includes fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the thumb@@ nail preview and selecting the item Display / Edit button .
image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , please refer to Set@@ ting up the Image Processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and among them the toolbar for quick access to most required functions .
the editing functions of image editing change your photos . none of the functions will however change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the toolbar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you might want to make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save this with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by recre@@ ating from the File menu or using the Rec@@ over button Rest@@ ore the image editing in the toolbar . you then lose any change you &apos;ve done on the photo since last saving .
virtually every action of image editing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can und@@ o by selecting Edit / Rest@@ ore , by selecting Edit Rec@@ over from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should take the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to und@@ o and remember C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the Rec@@ over or Rest@@ ore button on the toolbar for a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started the image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by moving the navigation buttons in the toolbar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can zoom in and out in the photo by using C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button on the toolbar : automatically choose the magni@@ fying factor
view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view where you use the Edit button . if you do not want this , you can edit this in the dialog from &amp; Edit . you can view this from the Edit Pan@@ e dialog . see the section for setting up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select the image from the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings before printing your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or entire sentences . entire image preview pages can be printed from your selection . you just need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Album Export Print Ass@@ ist . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is also available in image editing without the navigation file . it is displayed when one of the five tabs is cli@@ cked :
multiple Click on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again .
you can enter or paste labels with unlimited size in the label view . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you have commented on it , use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image , the labels will then be saved .
next to the application button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures .
the review section shows a valuation scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and sorting . it can be used either with a single click of the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select them and use the contex@@ tual menu .
the rating is written to the ur@@ gency IP@@ TC field . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used before in this dialog .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the input keyword , so you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful if you have a lot of keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further simpli@@ fication in the input of keywords in a series of images . if you have entered different keywords , they are saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword in the IP@@ TC field .
if several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please refer to the keyword Fil@@ ters section .
the Key@@ word keyword filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their Album , - Date , keyword and search views . if additional one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two will be displayed . all generated keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop tags . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword .
in the top example , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is based on no words , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected with C@@ trl + a , and then a keyword has been drawn from the right @-@ hand @-@ tree to the selection and stored there . a dialogue asks if this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created and state that it should be one or its , you can easily change it by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the record searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already placed in the database .
for example , you can set an Advanced Search on all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group@@ ing button . the options then look like this :
why weren &apos;t Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web respectively Fli@@ ck@@ r listed ? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I did it mainly to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have predictable deviation from the actually photograph@@ ed or scann@@ ed colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that the colors that you print or publish on the web that are from your digital dark@@ room .
when the topic comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons it has to press for the results they want . unfortunately , color management means that you have informed decisions at each point of image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide links with deeper information allowing you to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result .
if your picture workflow fulfil@@ s all six criteria listed below , you do not need to worry about color administration .
you work on a monitor calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB color space . ( for more information see below )
your only other image issues are per email or Web where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if so s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and thus have to worry about color management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to c@@ alli@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you work in the s@@ RGB color space or not , you need to sound your monitor as s@@ RGB is based on s@@ RGB so that your ; on@@ itor closes the circle . if you work as a color space of s@@ RGB , you either need to c@@ alli@@ bri@@ cate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve one image in most cases . therefore , use it before trying any further manual processing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , offset , automatic adjustment and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic correction try automatically from your colors to make the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the leu@@ k@@ screw values over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or balanced .
similar : this method adju@@ sts the brightness value factor of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . thus nearly every brightness area has the same number of pixels . sometimes , the comparison achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or it destro@@ ys it .
automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
enlarge contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the highest possible range and a re @-@ ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible with balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is slightly limited since a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color is worked . so if you can move too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu entry Col@@ ors White Balance of Image Processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview will dynamically customize the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target picture has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right up , a hist@@ ogram is shown that changes dynamically as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play with the above controls , use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available :
the Over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result displayed in white balance . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Load buttons make exactly this . any setting of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and load it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button returns all filter values to their default values and neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in another picture than your original . if you save these settings , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding needs more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color @-@ mapping can be done through the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter color management .
another important tool can be found in the menu under colors sound correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to use them for more photos . this is useful when your camera or your scanner always make the same mistake and you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure issues is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool colour effects provide you with four colour effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ister filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that emerged when you replaced a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . the colored , dark@@ er areas protected the sensitive photo paper from the additional light . this had the effect that the lighter areas dark@@ er and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls solar ar@@ isation . at about 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar energy efficiency . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simply , it em@@ belli@@ sh@@ es many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a colour film that is optimized for daylight by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . Vel@@ via &apos;s strongly saturated colours are too much for some photographers , especially those who have hardly any landscapes .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ ders re@@ ps the strength of the ne@@ on light . for large images , the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the photos . you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the reverse problem : one too big satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous thickness / contrast / g@@ amma the tool is set to improve exposure . even if the dialog with this tool works very complicated , you only need the area of the sli@@ der for the application intended here . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected range . under the graph , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to operate is to shift the controller and take care of how the image changes .
on the right , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be updated dynamically , using the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : this selection box can be used to determine whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y @-@ axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear representation is often the most useful . in images , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controllers : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color pin@@ points can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , middle and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers which can be used to change the output values as inter@@ actively as with the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a blank image as background while something else in the foreground is to be seen .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and Load : using these buttons , the set values can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . for that purpose , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposure In@@ dic@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect at the final result .
below you see an example of adjusting entry values to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha Channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
the left side shows half of the original and the target image . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . the following options are available on the right :
modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that changes from the module :
next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most useful . for images with large areas of a constant color , linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode continues .
for example , if you shift a curve to the right , e.g. the bright tones , you can see that these bright tones correspond to dark@@ er output stages and that the corresponding pixel pixels get dark@@ er .
on the preview of the original photos , a red marker is to be seen . if you want to change this mark to the area you want to change , a suitable line will be displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and Load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , medium and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ exposure In@@ dic@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if over@@ exposed pixels are found in more than one channel , you get the combined result displayed . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect at the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing is a tool to improve color channels or change color shades of the photos .
the Channel Mixer is another advanced tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by looking at relative distribution and rash . the left part of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to your own tab .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position this in the image a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will appear to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you enable L@@ umin@@ ance , the picture will retain the general brightness as well . if you activate lumin@@ ance , this is particularly convenient if you also activate the option Mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , since the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space . color @-@ space consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose pattern patterns in each channel look different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me conversion by reducing the color of the color first .
save as and load buttons are used for this purpose . any mixer setup allows you to save and load for later . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposure In@@ dic@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect at the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the Blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is activated . the original image is available under ( 1 ) and the processed image under ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of its abstract capability . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can be easily converted on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits particularly well with portraits of the sky .
orange Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate lun@@ ar scenes at daylight times . so similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ qui@@ aton : creates warm , bright and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of ble@@ aching a pressure and re@@ development in a s@@ amp@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ amp@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ kam , tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : post@@ p@@ one this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ tool ; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around an image .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the sc@@ attering eye . under picture fra@@ me@@ works the module can be started from image editing .
type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . throughout , the image borders with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , bor@@ dered it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a but@@ ton@@ effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be greater than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have previously used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture anywhere . this can also be done at several locations if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . use text execution , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background .
each setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool templates you can put a template over a picture .
the Image Tem@@ plate menu can be applied in image editing can be used to create templates on an image .
for the template there are no restrictions on size and orientation . however , you need to use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your sten@@ cil of &amp; digi@@ kam , send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your sten@@ cil folder with the base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings are scheduled for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . selecting a folder automatically updates the thumb@@ nail of the templates automatically .
under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button decreases the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole image , you need to zoom in accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the picture below the template . to do so , take the picture and place it in the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adapted to thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides three different sharpen@@ ing tools . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional sharpen@@ ing tool . it is very fast and simple , but generates gra@@ iny pictures especially in dark areas .
blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . in fact it sharp@@ ens no bit , it works rather psycho@@ acousti@@ cally . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus as well as most digital images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is due to the fact that the digi@@ tization process must combine colors with only minimal differences to a color point . this in turn causes sharp edges to be printed together . S@@ LR cameras typically need more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers already turn a sharpen@@ ing filter while reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control over your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with sharpen@@ ing work . you can use the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ er sharpen@@ ing .
they should be careful , however , as the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also increases the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image re@@ focus the tool . you can re@@ focus more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the image a little sof@@ tly is much easier than shar@@ pen it . use the soft sign tool with the Con@@ duc@@ er sof@@ tness and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the Filter Un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove sli@@ pper from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview will help you to edit the image . the preview window will display the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount ampli@@ fies the effect . if you make the blur@@ ring mask too strong , ru@@ stling and the impression of gr@@ ats will produce close to sharp edges .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image that is added to the original . this will set the strength of the focus .
the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applied difference amount . thus , you can define a minimum difference with it for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft altern@@ ation between the tones are excluded from shar@@ per and therefore beauty errors in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus a picture by improving sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted removal filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tr@@ ation . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is using a blur@@ ring mask . re@@ focus mostly reaches better results than blur@@ red mask . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing on colors in image editing .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos; fold . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche folding has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ les that are far from the original qu@@ ell@@ pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Vienna In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos; F@@ itting is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels .
circular hot@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular fis@@ sion . it is the most important parameter to use this module . for most images , the default value should result in 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very blur@@ red then pay attention to hal@@ o notes .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module .
noise Fil@@ ters : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the filter can accept values of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will further mi@@ tig@@ ate the image .
G@@ auss &apos;s focus : this is the radius for the palate . use this parameter if your blur@@ ring is Gau@@ ß &apos; . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 in order to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value non@@ zero then you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size of the die can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular hot@@ ness or the g@@ auss &apos;s edge . note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Load buttons are used for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to correct all the cutting , color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read and comp@@ ress pictures , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , Un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by blur@@ ring mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically , im@@ partial mas@@ king must always produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions , it can never remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Vienna filter one can show that it is the optimal linear filter . the result of the FI@@ R Vienna filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ ring mask . the FI@@ R Vienna filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods of focuss@@ ing in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the regulator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ lä@@ tte &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sets the blur@@ ring of the area dark@@ ened in order to create a more natural pup@@ il . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ink ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust it here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pre @-@ settings as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pre @-@ settings are listed below :
if you want to fine adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a uniform smooth@@ ness above the picture . whereas larger values tend to smooth homogen@@ ous regions and detail . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is needed afterwards .
directional dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value close to 1 is only smooth@@ ed in one direction . if you have a movie gran@@ ul@@ ator or CCD noise , a high value will produce wa@@ vy pattern . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing rate over all@@ el@@ . p then defines the relative smo@@ othing . therefore , put this value corresponding to the degree of smoking in your picture .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ a effect it must be set higher than 3 .
repeat : specifies how often the algorithm is going to go through . usually this is enough for 1 or 2 .
angle Ex@@ pos@@ ure da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is small , it should also be chosen small . make sure that small angles generate a long term . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integrated step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never t@@ aller than 2 .
using linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more the quality you receive by selecting this option is low , but it doubles the running time . we therefore recommend it to leave it out .
the Save As and Load Buttons do exactly this . correct any setting of pixel errors can be saved into a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting errors is comparatively fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button .
below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a strange black Art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that caused by a bad movie shift during the trip . the original image is available under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , only the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced Settings can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is needed per pixel and can wipe the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus smaller errors .
focus : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to detect lumin@@ ance changes . if it is increased , noise spi@@ kes will be removed . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can be removed or noise spi@@ kes can occur . set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve one image . these settings do not influence the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve one image . these settings do not influence the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ em@@ ance tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark@@ er areas , which are typically smo@@ ked more strongly . however , it also lubric@@ ates the shadow areas .
atten@@ uation : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter damp@@ ing . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter range re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , smo@@ kers and phase j@@ itter appear at the edges .
save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all the noise reduction parameters you set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied using the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little sof@@ tly is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool to sof@@ ten the sof@@ tness with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tness and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this restoration method gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ul@@ arity , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local faults that occur in digital , original or subsequently digi@@ ti@@ zed images .
the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm it produces some compres@@ sions &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save As and Load buttons make exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button .
below you can reduce how a photo is reduced with uni@@ formity noise .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie has been recorded with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film@@ making on the faces . the original image is available under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photograph that was scann@@ ed using a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by scanner illumination and photo paper . the original image is available under ( 1 ) and the corrected image under ( 2 ) .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ Pix@@ els allows you to remove Hot@@ pixels from photos that have been captured with a CCD camera gem . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by copy@@ righ@@ ted by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode , as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels quot ; and &apos; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file in the wizard with the button dark@@ screen . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these will be highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you start the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD failures .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic dark image processing will detect the bad pixels . note that the wizard shows the last dark image and re@@ charges it automatically in the next session .
the image area and preview will help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are up@@ lifted in all pre@@ views .
select an area around the broken pixels on the preview and see the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
Dur@@ ing : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to compu@@ te a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of quad@@ ratic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compu@@ te a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area equally . instead , &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ost@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ ady ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by lowering the light that reaches the sensor there . telep@@ hot@@ o lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 for aperture filter , which increases the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances , which makes it impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filter , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller because there are otherwise blur@@ red effects caused by movement .
with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s filters and the color and gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a Center@@ filter by using an equivalent transformation on a frame filter made without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ Surgery applies the transformation with a Center@@ filter to an image . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three controls , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ correction filter and with three more exposure of the target picture .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light ampli@@ fication at the point of the largest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with aperture setting of 1 , or accidentally a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 , reduce the density to compensate a small degree of vig@@ net@@ ting .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , since you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of exposure of the finish image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the Edit menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . an adjustment and contrast correction have also been done with this tool .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David H@@ od@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . color@@ less distortion can not be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree deals with the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x shape of the picture .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s off the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ effici@@ ents fourth degree correc@@ ts the remote corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of distortion second degree . with negative values t@@ onal distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth degree . this value is stronger at the margins than in the middle of the image . for most lenses the &apos; Corner parameter has the inver@@ ted mark of the parameter gener@@ el .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus leads to a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image res@@ ize .
ligh@@ ten : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the spher@@ ical or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before any trimm@@ ing or size changes . the best result is that you perform this correction as the first . in case you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a spher@@ ical correction , the effect is apparently the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal guide line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to display dotted lines . move it to an important location , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the sound / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove it using the cutting tool in the menu Trans@@ forming trimm@@ ing from image editing or using the Zoom sli@@ der of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs such as shots from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . keep in mind that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the spher@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown in ( 1 ) and the corrected image under ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simulate the inf@@ ra @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ anz@@ a.@@ org web site which is accessible under this URL . the filter reproduced the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set two parameters of film gran@@ ul@@ arity and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . turn on the In@@ sert Film@@ cour@@ ge option if you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO @-@ controller changes the amount of the film gran@@ ul@@ arity and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows become white like snow !
since the filter mixes color channels for producing infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared film effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is available under ( 1 ) and the processed image under ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a type of aura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter movie gran@@ ul@@ arity is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce movie gran@@ ul@@ arity on your pictures . this is known from classical high @-@ speed films like the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the movies , the makers mix big silver grains of photo emul@@ sion .
the film body effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image acqu@@ ires a timeless atmosphere loose from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ photo , gran@@ ular view especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film @-@ gra@@ ined effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil paintings give your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two controllers to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brush is better for large images . smo@@ othing the smooth@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the hin@@ ge .
this is an example of oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size is 1 and G@@ lä@@ tte 17 .
the &amp; Edit filter ; Filter carbon drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal sketch . images whose gra@@ dients change slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine the scene you have chosen to sketch . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter Grav@@ ure shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter en@@ grav@@ ings is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well in images with a simple structure , where color is not the most important at the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the depth used is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distor@@ tions . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave Block 1 : spl@@ its the image into cells and makes it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the shaft blocks 1 , the picture is distorted with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time for calculation and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects anytime with the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a central point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radial bl@@ ur : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels around a central point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : camera shooting from a car or train .
sof@@ tening blur@@ red : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly into the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ or photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
shar@@ pen bl@@ ur : blur@@ red the image by a random shift of the pixels and simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the colour bas@@ ins in the picture and wi@@ pes them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time for calculation and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button end .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing to hold an area free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drops filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can get it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or rotating . the tools can be found in the menu Trans@@ forming Rot@@ ating or transforming mirrors .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo in case of minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture if the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change transforming size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below .
change the size of the tool using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , try to infl@@ ate the tool .
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to magni@@ fy an image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbine effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Load Kno@@ bs are used exactly for this purpose . enlarge each st@@ ables for photo , can be saved as a text file and loaded later .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button .
you can see below an example of photo bubbles by enlar@@ ging a small picture on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear default magni@@ fication for comparison .
cro@@ pping a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to assemble a picture . to cut a photo you have to create with the mouse just the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle while moving the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photo is cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by dra@@ gging on the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can be created by dra@@ gging it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The cutting button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo is trimm@@ ed ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the Save file or Save file under the File menu to save the newly @-@ cut photo .
you can change the size of the rect@@ angle in the preview area by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact .
trimm@@ ing in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in the portrait aspect , the greater value is always assigned to the height and in the trans@@ verse width of the width .
cutting the tool after aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches , inches or any other physical size . you can e.g. see below a list of traditional dimensions for photo paper and its aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog two buttons exist to center the selection automatically horizontally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog box , you can set the area for cutting to the maximum possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
trimm@@ ing the tool after aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the trimm@@ ing tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data reflects the cut image and not the original image .
the setup help settings allow you to insert aids in order to better assemble your pictures . these help are :
harmonic triangle : harmonic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ party rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a way of dividing a rect@@ angle in a similarly harmonious tri@@ angles at the diagonal .
golden center : the golden center is a division which is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spir@@ als of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the flower leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has been used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who thus constructed your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden gradu@@ ation at all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition which follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden center provides liquid help lines when you put together an image . these aids are listed below :
the Golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal for your photos . compared to the third el@@ bow , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition conduc@@ ts the gaze of the be@@ holder along the line of the spiral and creates on this kind a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
another rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . these rect@@ angles are used to create the golden spiral . there should be something that distra@@ cts the eye into the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the middle points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal angles . diag@@ on@@ als to these lines can make a static object more dynamic .
when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame create an effect called dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your image focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the Horizon@@ tal and Ver@@ tical Options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
when you make a photo , it is easy that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizontally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated by an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing and the tool free rotation . choose to move free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the slide angle . the values on this slide are given in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the sli@@ der to 0 ° . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right corner .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after turning a picture you will find un@@ desired tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix it is to use the function Trans@@ forming trimm@@ ing from image editing .
an elegant way to crop the image is the Automati@@ cally cutting function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option leaves the picture a bit after the turn . but keep in mind the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tival trans@@ formations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called point of reference . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle links below : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle Right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is blur@@ red . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you &apos;ve adapted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . a possibility to clean it is to cut the picture with transforming cutting out of the image processing .
the sh@@ ading tool is used to move part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . a horizontal shift e.g. will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left . this is not a rotation , the image is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transforming scissors .
she@@ ar your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . you can shift both horizontally and vertically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview pane .
move the mouse to an important point , like the lake , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sh@@ ading tool to adjust your image .
after you &apos;ve done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture gets a bit blur@@ red . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing this effect is mostly negli@@ gible , but two sets are generating twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image has un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transforming cutting out of the image processing .
&amp; Edit ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing .
because of this dependen@@ cy on other libraries it is impossible at this point to give a list of all file formats that are available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF below .
&amp; Edit ; shows only files in formats that are familiar with . this happens by file extension and comparing it with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , it will edit &amp; edit the file in image editing . you can change this list of file extensions and edit them . see the Configuration section for more information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; Edit ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images . this reduces redundant information in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss@@ less if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read from Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful gu@@ id@@ ances in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es. more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all supported cameras can be viewed at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw data edited by &amp; digi@@ kam .
many digital cameras support recording short movies . these clips are often saved in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; but is not a movie editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to view or edit films . when you click on a movie file , the &amp; k@@ de ; use settings to play movies to start playing the program .

many tools you need to follow the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; included . your description follows here .
all image editing tools like sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ tness , noise suppression , re@@ focusing , blur@@ red mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture Application quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical sharing without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected area .
horizontal sharing without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower than the effect of the filter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouse over &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ exposure and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noted .
the side@@ bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data originate from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it . move it while you press the left mouse button . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to draw a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the Pal@@ ettes files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be considered either for the entire system or only one user . in the latter case , they are located in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the Palette palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders by files .
the cursor is displayed in the palette view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it points to the color next to it . the color is described under the Pal@@ let view . here also the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to choose from . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse with the left mouse button pressed .
if the check box C@@ ursor under the Add Color button is activated , the color is inserted from the color table at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the Over@@ write mode has been selected . you can set this mode by selecting the check box Over@@ write under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy , Cut and Pa@@ ste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for clip@@ board data : three values for each color for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end character . if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit .
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select a color anywhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science , and so far there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs that include &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are out@@ dated &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with few functions .
the &amp; k@@ Graphi@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the features of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ Graphi@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ Graphics ; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; an . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( allowing a change in the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; re@@ compu@@ te the graph and add in &amp; k@@ alli@@ views ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; to open or to open the graph in a k@@ ate ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; -@@ component
load large graphs ( currently there are problems starting from about 1,000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to present more than these nodes )
additional required software : &amp; k@@ alli@@ Viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for representation of graphs . required are in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you start a graphic viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the file icon and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the lower screen@@ shot :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed if the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
using the mouse wheel ( up and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt + button ) ;
zo@@ oming in both directions is limited by a factor of 10 . below is the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ Graphi@@ viewer ; can also mem@@ ori@@ ze your decision , so that later will proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Set@@ Scal@@ e@@ viewer ; set up ... see also .
when you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ Graphi@@ viewer ; instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new or k@@ not viewer ; instance or want to display the graphs to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice dur@@ ably , but also change it with the setup dialog .
upon program start , you can open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both save as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come on a page will be matched to this page . the aspect ratio will be ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled in by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with a page distributed on multiple pages without header and with a different font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut loading page gives you the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore changes ) or let the program ask for each time .
the Open page provides the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ Graphi@@ viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside a current session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the session management page gives you the possibility to specify the start behaviour of &amp; k@@ alli@@ Viewer . you can set a default behavior ( open or not ) or specify the files of the last session or decide to be asked for each start afterwards .
the context menu , which appears normally at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ N , opens other options :
here you can choose from different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directional graph@@ ene . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graphs of directional graphs . the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the default for un@@ coated graphs . it produces represent@@ ations according to the jump spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ spr@@ int model for un@@ coated graphs . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics tab , and includes a multi @-@ purpose trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm classi@@ fies the nodes in a circle according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph file as a parameter , and output the comp@@ uted layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can specify &amp; eg ; s &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms change special options , or even change the graph with a filter before drawing .
determines the type of graph@@ ene ( directed or ung@@ eri@@ ed ) and applies the standard algorithm for each type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ coated graphs ) .
if this setting is activated , the overview will be shown , if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .

the K@@ IP@@ I module includes tools to read and store new images and save them .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface for reading images from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source like Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu item images , a dialog appears which lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select here the source you want to fetch the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by replacing the default values of duc@@ r@@ ye to select your image accordingly . see the preview and customize the area to meet your needs before you start scanning the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner .
make sure the window is completely displayed , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pressed the scan button you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window will appear to set the options of the image file . please remember that the BM@@ P type is not compressed and therefore creates very large files . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image .
screen shots can be created after you have selected Import - &gt; Screen shots in the menu . a window appears in which you can set different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can view other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible workplace . if you have chosen to read the entire desktop , only the window is read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other des@@ kt@@ ops , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate .
after the screen@@ shot is made , the dialog box Options dialog appears with the options described above .

the Export module to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of generating a token . it is used for your authentication . it is basically your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is launched to allow you to login to Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after successful registration , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r web page . the following page will be presented after a successful registration .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after pressing Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the Export module is started to Fli@@ ck@@ r to the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which shows the current access permissions that the module displays . for up@@ loading , you will need write permissions . the module also does not support other permissions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions .
the button to add photos should be pressed once you have all the other options set . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . clicking on the O@@ k button will start up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server .
the keywords field can be filled with a comm@@ a @-@ separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during upload .
with the options Public , Friends and Family Ju@@ lie , you can set the permissions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you change the option Modi@@ fy the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value entered in maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery @-@ export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF keyword of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and l@@ atitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data , you need a GPS track as an XML file in the g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical Loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the above @-@ to @-@ see dialog appears then . to load a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . this file contains of course data recorded at the same locations as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed that indicates the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera &apos;s time must be converted with GMT . this can be done using the time zone . set your camera time zone here .
the adjustment for the maximum time deviation indicates the upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time . if the deviation is included , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from a location for pictures you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add it to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the inter@@ pol@@ ation and difference in min can be used if you have no matching data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog box addresses the coordinates of one call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set up with the displayed map . to do so , select the region in question and enlarge it . repeat this time and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be manually selected . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Picture Gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all the albums you want to export to HTML . you only need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums .
the App@@ ear@@ ance App@@ ear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default picture viewer , &amp; eg ; ick@@ show
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all your associated images . select a folder where you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Suite containing everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG File Format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new pictures .
you can change the standard color depth with Other color depth , which of course also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nails will allow you to customize some of the settings from the Album Reiter for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors have occurred during production . the web browser will be started automatically at the end to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I Viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations like turns , zo@@ oming or post@@ p@@ one . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . he has been developed for quick image display and quick access to his functions .
after the start , an image will be displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less Module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
this module allows for the actions listed below to save images in JPEG format without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size is increasing , since no compression of the color information takes place . this can be found in PNG format , for example .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then open the file selection dialog with which you can select the destination image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please look at exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module is a tool for converting a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add a base image transfer between the individual images . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program to burn the medium .
you first need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . after that you can create the module via extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images you have selected are then listed under image files in the Portfolio . there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high , very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG output file . if possible , keep the extension mp@@ g .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after adjusting all settings to your wishes , you can use the encoding button to start generating the movie . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or quickly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow once you are back .
if a note appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages using the Settings icon on the bottom right corner .
the print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image Gim@@ p . this is useful e.g. to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it generates the same results as the software from your camera maker . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the raw file to convert and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings are to be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later .
a Four Color R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the filen@@ ame remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG using a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it .
the Tag@@ ged Image Format , TIFF , keeps all information of your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you intend to edit your images often or otherwise continue using JPEG format , you should not select the JPEG format , as it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deterior@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG File in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel .
the batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are certain , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing files automatically . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar indicates how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the score and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or enlarge the image . for this purpose , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
propor@@ tionally ( 2 D@@ im . ) : change in size in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . for example , you can use this option to customize your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportional size changes in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
pre @-@ press : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred E @-@ Mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent beforehand .
after you have started the module , the images will be displayed with the selected images . by adding images , you can add more images with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview is displayed on the right .
you can also drag and drop images to the list of images to add you to the list of images to be sent .
the button Images will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after selecting all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you have selected are attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
don &apos;t mind to send too many pictures at once . most email accounts have restrictions on the size of emails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be saved and used every time you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments to the images will be added to a text file and the mail is attached .
PNG format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG to image file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original exposure data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages on the search for errors . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window will appear with questions like you want to display your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album here .
the option Open@@ GL passes in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you will need to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slideshow will be very slow .
the Display file name option ensures that the file name of the images in the lower left corner is displayed during the presentation .
the Loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c ; Cancel .
the option images random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used to order the images in the album .
the temporal distance between the images can be set between the pictures . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . you should check this out before presenting your presentation to your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly , each transition between the images chooses a different effect .
during the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn it on .
with this toolbar you can pause and restart the presentation , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slideshow .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current filen@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .

the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting an image as a background image for the desktop .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected sub@@ menu option , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; browsing through these pictures . as you can see by comparing them with the image , there are now entries in each group , so in people , locations and in group keywords .
in the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with comments . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course see the current preview images .
when you press the mouse over the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person only the images on which both persons are shown . by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images .
if you have selected all the persons , locations and other settings , you can display thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity .
in the image , each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , which is of course also true for places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture .
to view images next to the names , select the button located on the right of the toolbar . in the appearing context menu , you can choose which view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with pictures of persons and a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
however , you must decide for yourself which image to display for each individual person . to do this , you need to open the image preview window ( described in more detail ) and select the categories editor in the context menu . here you can select the image for the respective person . in the view window , you can customize the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you enter the Find entry in the main window , a dialog will appear to show you a dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog once more .
if you enter a string in the field of inscription or description , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to be searched ; the date can be either part of the total date , i.e. , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all the images according to certain names as you can see in the picture .
this is the User Manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not like to read manuals , but rather want to try the same features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the fast entry , screen@@ shots and introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialog the demo , if you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; launch for the first time , or select in the Help menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . then some sample images are loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the Homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar displays you date statistics on the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10 minutes sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed items preview view from the database ( when you select a date , the first image of that date will appear in the preview window ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview pane .
you can also select an area of tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and dra@@ gging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , you will only see images of that period in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML web pages with your pictures . the one is integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as a module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create via the File menu ...
before HTML pages are created , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and target . in the following , each section is described in more detail .
first , enter the title of the song and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created which is visible on the overview page .
la@@ stly , you can choose which information to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information appears , which are obvious to the viewer without description . for example , that all images are from a party . note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; therefore , you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically discussed .
at the bottom of the page you can set various resolutions for the images . this means those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more download images that have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you specified . so it can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transfer time . if you want to get an image bigger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
please select a base folder for all of your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , you must select the main folder in which all your pictures are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically completed next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can choose either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if they are really visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created . the URL you specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files you created are not yet in the final destination folder , you have to manually copy them to it . so that the import function , see , properly works , you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings described above have related all three to base folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you might want to create your pictures with these . however , if you have spent a lot of time applying the image information , persons on the pictures , recording location , etc . then you have to work with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not make this work again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ in file . these can import others into your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file contains only a link to images . the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you have all the pictures together and that you can share this file as independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ in file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ in file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in a tw@@ o@@ fold manner . first , it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ in file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can view from the File menu ...
the main option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available :
if you want to copy the manual to the .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally option to copy to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export file option .
the last option of this page is maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu ... select , it will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the wizard for import consists of four steps . first , you must select which images you want to import , then , in which folders you want to copy the imported pictures .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category of persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is called people . therefore , in the third dialog box , you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories correspond to your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . for example , see the image .
it just has to be easy to browse and look at pictures : if you see pictures , you often want to jump inside of different picture groups . for example , if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pic@@ tured .
in this manual , you will pass the various steps from ( 1 ) to determine the information about your images , about ( 2 ) the browsing and viewing , to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; saves all of its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , to a disk or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder in which your pictures are stored and automatically re@@ stores them on future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can start a different folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with option -@@ c . as example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you can go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual we will explain the different settings .
on the left you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call by pressing a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option .
it describes how you can set different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group you can select an inscription and a symbol .
sub@@ categories were already mentioned in the section . in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , rather than all groups of a single member as explained in .
in the left panel of the list you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its module system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . next information can be found on the Homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called via the Module menu . modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ not album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can call via the module itself .
since the modules are used by several applications together , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before you use them on your own pictures . demo database can be called either using the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu .
the applications that the modules use via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications can arrange their images in albums : this is an album simply a folder . even though &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates order for albums so that you can use the features with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
simul@@ ated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , i.e. all images that show you the picture preview right now .
next to the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here &apos;s &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , if you use the category people for example , you will do so , so do if you have selected people to view and share it with the module .
since some modules are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do so , start the settings dialog and select the modules you want to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen when you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to by any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu bar at the top . under the toolbar , you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . in the section we will not find much information about your pictures yet . in the section we will display pictures that show you an overview of all available pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to provide any image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons appearing in the image , etc . you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures simultaneously . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is m@@ apped and all pictures recorded in Copenhagen .
all of these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
here you can see three lists with a text field by specifying people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always be using them whenever you enter information about your images .
the following idea is based on shifting the images within the list : if you have a family celebration , for example , and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can , so that the names used are moved upwards , the persons find and arrange them faster .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sort by date icon on the list .
if you have selected comments for each image individually , you may still want to edit all the selected images and add comments . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons that are under the thumb@@ nail of the image above .
if you have taken several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the US . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California .
on the picture you see a browser window showing the USA as an over@@ print . to show you that it is an over@@ board , a special icon will be shown .
in the Comment dialog &apos;s context menu , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag and drop an entry to a category to make it a sub@@ category of this entry .
you can shift the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the buttons that form the top edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the pane .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... button that offers you the option to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also hide a frame completely . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide windows . this process can be seen in the picture .
when you select the images in your browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images if you don &apos;t have filters . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be created as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will appear in the picture viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the Image preview . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or choose Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now the window that you can see in the picture will be displayed .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely , you can have saved images anywhere , so that you can record the pictures anywhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all needed pictures can be downloaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper corner is cli@@ pped is not stored on the hard drive . however , for the images 5 @-@ 9 , the thumb@@ nails are available , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also view these images with the picture viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy and copy files from the folders . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you want to avoid trouble on how to avoid the jum@@ ble of your pictures , please buy a larger hard drive to save all the pictures .
in the Image menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end those remain that you want to make for others in@@ accessible and click on current view in the privacy menu . alternatively , you can also use all the pictures that your little sister can see , control and unlock the menu entry All other than current view .
so you have set which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give your laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures , which will fade out all the images you have locked . if you want to get the pictures displayed again , click Lo@@ cking .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this image protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the disk and on the other hand , anyone who can access the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is used only to deny the view of private images .
the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album features an image _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered about the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where has it been made , etc .
if you want to see the info@@ box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag and drop it . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether any information is to be displayed . all of these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . the then appearing context menu can be seen below .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here on the browser , see the matching entries to this . if you click on Anne Her@@ ein , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Her@@ ein . as if you selected persons from the browser and then Anne Her@@ ene .
if you have several images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the image up and down the image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can let them run as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete room on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can zoom in and zoom in . to zoom in , you can simply pull out a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the minus key , you can zoom out the plus button zo@@ oming in the center of the image . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zoom .
with the point key , you can reset your zoom , so that the image will not be zo@@ omed . with the power button , the zoom starts , so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work in videos are that they come in and out with the plus and key key .
the rotation functions from the context menu allow you to rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments to the current image using the menu item Comments from the context menu .
when you look at pictures it can happen that you will find an image with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can browse the view and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter those names . however , you may prefer to mark only the image and view more images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you look one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to add pictures with features while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in the picture you can see a picture in which the marks A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , these are available in your browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , you can easily tag them all at once . this is described in . then you can use a module to copy the selected images onto a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you view categories in the particular preview view , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the picture was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case allows you to paint photo album ; on the picture .
the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way , you can und@@ o your painted one later .
in the picture you can see a picture on which it was painted . to turn on the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; select View on the image from the context menu . to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; you need to use the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully dominate , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should be read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire @-@ model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on either the toolbar icon or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed so that you can select the correct position :
delete selected objects from the scene using Del@@ ete either from the Edit menu or from the right mouse button context menu .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to take those changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or reject the changes with Cancel .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; input the user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press Pre@@ view in the Properties view and a small example of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture . as default the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a sub @-@ arranged element ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick the box locally .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a level of visibility as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their Visi@@ bility level is smaller or equal to the Visi@@ bility level selected in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it arbitr@@ arily . you can also store multiple window orders and switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the beginning to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange several views on top of each other , drag the beginner right in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the index tabs at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement is pending views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the beginning to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left at the beginning bar .
to close a view click on the small cross at the beginning . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them anywhere .
you can save the current window view with the window arrangement ... Save . a dialog will appear where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; uses &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . when this manual is written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering Symbol icon in the toolbar or select the menu entry View scene .
a render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in View R@@ ender modes ... select the following dialog :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , useful is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image section for rendering in the input fields .
in the combination field quality you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of render properties can be found in the User &apos;s Manual &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
when a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , compu@@ te and combine &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling includes the neighbouring pixels . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is continuously divided and adapted because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by pursuing a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4 x 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel will be calculated .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel .
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are further pursued and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . when you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , changed &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light reflection calcul@@ ates . it takes very long to let a scene calculate with this property .
on this map you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays didn &apos;t hit any object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly termin@@ ated , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; Import scene , select Import menu item ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command set by &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings appear when im@@ porting , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copying and past@@ ing in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the Properties view , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( such as high @-@ field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the colour for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type marks .
you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can adjust the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and spins .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions .
if you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for advanced projections , all wire @-@ model views will be further divided if the camera uses an advanced projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this property results in a better approach to projections , but requires more time to render .
if you cross the wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you cross the floor , a floor underneath the objects is rendered . the floor is displayed in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
if you tick the edge smo@@ othing method , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering scenes . you can set the depth and threshold values in the R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window classi@@ fications . in the window arrangement , it will explain how to create and store window classi@@ fications .
the standard window arrangement : displays all existing window arrangement . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window configurations . you can create a new arrangement using the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Remove button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the Remove button .
new column . create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with tab card you get a map view together with the previous view and flo@@ ats the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , very popular among beginners : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you are using a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you will get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you just get a black picture .
if you have installed everything without errors , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pres@@ et window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the icons of the toolbar . please read the documentation to get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will often have to use these menus and symbols , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit menu entry . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire @-@ model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the nam@@ esp@@ ace camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , you will find further details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the target position of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
if you press the Apply button or the Enter key , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , you see the scene from the perspective of the camera here .
there are many ways to create the bottom for the scene . for example , you could insert a box ( insert End Body Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method of solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers actually a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as a floor :
a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply icon or the Enter key . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire @-@ model view now also displays the plane , al@@ beit at the moment only as a fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane extends to the horizon .
if you look closely at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor when you click on the + in front of the object . in this case you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . choose one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should move the floor to the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose a shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select something simple at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog opens , in which you can choose how to insert the object . please select first sub @-@ object . the pigment is then displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = ground pig@@ ments ) , click on the preview button to see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the pig@@ ments preview only shows a matte black material , because you have to re @-@ enter settings for the pig@@ ments . therefore always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time by clicking on preview . also , there are many possibilities , but now take the simplest .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the header and the ball in the preview , just click on the Apply button and then click on the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your picture with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you expected . here are other settings necessary . in the color list , you need to enter two new attributes , called one @-@ color . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , choose one @-@ color every time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should be able to perform this step already , since you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the sphere can be created just as easy as the ground :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to push the input button or the application button ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground , since you moved the floor around one unit down@@ wards .
of course , rendering now results in a strange result : as you can see before , the spher@@ ical surface appears like a matte black material . in the following step , place a suitable material .
once you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the floor , give the sphere a pigment as a color :
select first sub @-@ object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press the Enter key .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of the possibilities offered by you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you &apos;ve learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ ing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders scenes ) by each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected and broken by the objects , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog effect . thus the scene pixels are processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also don &apos;t see anything , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene that should be rendered need some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and a disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since last storage will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you haven &apos;t saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last re@@ trac@@ ted command . you can only select this menu entry if you have used Edit / Un@@ do .
stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , short@@ cuts and default behavior .
opens a dialog to change keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option to change short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog for setting up tool@@ bars . using this option , you can add and remove tool icons for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; -@@ commands .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to pre@@ heat rough surfaces without having to model each diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map and texture map .
basic geomet@@ ries are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart .
&amp; incu@@ b@@ ator ; is a convenient image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; cubic show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can click on &amp; L@@ MB@@ s , or the Return key .
you can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching filen@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can exit the input field by pressing Return or Es@@ c .
in the Setup - &amp; Sk@@ ills show ; there are five card flash@@ cards . in three of them , general and editing and slide show , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; incu@@ b@@ ator ; in the two other , short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be set for each window .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can set down further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is activated , the next image in the folder , while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay if you select the next image and is especially suitable for a slideshow .
with this option , &amp; ku@@ ebel@@ show ; when you finish the name of the last opened folder . at the next start , opens and displays the game ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used in to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if the window is larger than the image in the window mode , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can set up &amp; kick show ; set up that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
specify whether the slideshow will start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows right next to the input field .
here you can change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of &amp; cu@@ ter@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short instructions for the display window and short instructions for your browser .
with this option , you switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in one window .
shows large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
shows small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; incu@@ b@@ ator ; will also be closed if no browser window is open .
show the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the filen@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a quick image editing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform corrections and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes his part to at least issues and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ photo ; makes it as easy as possible to report errors or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains an entry reports you have problems or wishes . this shows a dialog with a link . if you use this , your browser will open a page for reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already completed and you can simply follow the instructions to give your message .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . i.e. , users and developers can help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ photo ; then we encourage you to join the user mail@@ ing@@ list of &amp; show@@ photo ; you can ask here questions to other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , you can ask questions to other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best way to participate in the show@@ photo is to join the developer mailing list . guide to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; tries to give you as much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ casing . to access these settings , you need to set up in the Settings show@@ shot ; setting up . the settings dialog is sub@@ divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left .
in the field of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ exposed or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should indicate the colors with what you want to display in contrast . exposure should indicate a light color and over@@ exposure a dark colour .
the main window of the show@@ photo has a side bar on the right edge that provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in image editing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five tabs :
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning pictures that no longer makes scan and save images .
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer makes images scan and save . &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE website by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be placed on the command line of &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; if this scanner can &apos;t be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel reply .
the other settings include more detailed drivers &quot; options . &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ x@@ ks@@ ane ) does not particularly handle these options .
to scan an image , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview scan is started by the preview button .
in order to better select the image , the user can zoom in and out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit into the window .
when the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the Scan button .
if a preview is displayed in the settings before saving , the image will be shown in a preview window as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie returns and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button will open the dialog with the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if wished , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the type as &amp; chan@@ g@@ ite ; to select images . open dialog to save each image opens the dialog before each scann@@ ed image . if you want to save this automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you have to choose Save without asking for a filen@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save option without asking for a filen@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ...
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically saved images and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is every time highly counted when a picture is saved . the character string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; Hand@@ book . the button About starts the K@@ DE over dialog for &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings displays the dialog for Settings and C@@ lose can be used to finish &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite .

below you will find a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global short@@ cuts can be set up by right @-@ clicking in the player window and setting up a Global keyboard short@@ cut ... Click with the right mouse button in the player window and select Sh@@ ort@@ cuts ... select .
you can set up any existing multimedia keys in such a way that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Sh@@ ort@@ cuts . by doing so , make your keyboard to the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that usually can be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is meant to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some of its own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script to see if all the required modules are present and use k@@ dialog so that the user knows why a script does not run .
start require &apos; cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit &apos;
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required features . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is using the d@@ co@@ p command ; any K@@ DE installation should be included .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . for this purpose , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively simple . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should continuously monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events even if it has no use for it .
configure Run the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok places the working folder to the folder where all data should be saved .
track@@ Change Sign@@ alizes that a new piece is being played . the script could now query &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can query more information about the new track ( for example , the metadata or the unit length ) .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ izing men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le P@@ aths Inclu@@ des the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a custom menu entry is cli@@ cked . to add a custom entry , you can use the d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) to remove an entry . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M signal to the script . this signal should be processed , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user and z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name such as me skri@@ p@@ t.@@ amar@@ ok@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 , so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept scrip@@ ting packages with the amar@@ ok@@ script deployment . for this reason , you should name your script par@@ c@@ els right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the -@@ p T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file permissions :
when your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; app@@ end . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; script .

call up similar performers : after activating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; get a list with similar performers to the played piece . you can view the list in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to be able to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small tutorial on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minim@@ ally .
some features such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager will keep the relevant standards from fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will thus work , but flu@@ x@@ box will help for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ li@@ b library for days . you can locate the file by using ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang the broken file causing the crash .
mostly this is because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes while reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is somewhat mature .
make sure that all libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X then this leads to crash when editing the Met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable auto . turn off when in@@ active for ... in adjusting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically at a crash ) . if this is a common crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ information , but do not mark it as Uni@@ code . the following per@@ l script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; File $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s symbols in the status bar ( shu@@ ffle mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) always look active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can fix the symbol effects in the Control Center under App@@ ear@@ ance icons . note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ al@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ co app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error you may need to remove any colli@@ ding Q@@ t or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first .
there are several possibilities . most installation problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also look for help with other users or with developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please insert a bug there if you have something to fix an error in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , only an empty playlist appears . how do you get music there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the interface intui@@ tively , the Start sub@@ window has been converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column show rating . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for one piece . you can also use the short command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select From Play@@ list Remove from the drop down menu .
drag a playlist file to the playlist and drop it there , just as you would do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , next to the Add button , the playlist is located . click on it .
you probably don &apos;t have the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also check for lib@@ tool , this package contains many very nice visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be called G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much any audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it can ! perhaps use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which in default does not include MP3 deco@@ ders ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ hat mp3 node , input key
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer enables several applications to use the device at the same time and output audio at the same time . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause of problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to supply another sink ( e.g. , os@@ s@@ sink ) .
you can &apos;t just send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , deco@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
even X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause distorted playback . read this bug report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you don &apos;t use the Arts Driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been heavily optimized for analy@@ zers ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the fewer supports react to the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must register all the components . follow @-@ register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask for the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download the m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files once as system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer .
if you have a full list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . in addition , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be awak@@ ened by the gentle tones of music that you have stopped prior to going to bed .
how to get the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles if you are on another computer ?
if there is a working SSH environment , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the current piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ p d@@ co@@ p --@@ user your@@ username Amar@@ ok player now@@ pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires your identification in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ ali@@ zations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press d on the keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer opens in an independent window resi@@ zable in the size .
the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button represents one piece in the click sequence into the queue . pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky features , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ?
click on the name of a browser . in the context menu you can choose which browser to display .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click Play Audio CD from the menu . a file browser with multiple folders will open . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , instead , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ates , &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &apos; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ;
basically this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the play was played . the more often the play was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result .
you can enter the rating for a piece by yourself by right @-@ clicking on a column heading in the play@@ lists window . then you can change the review of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by right @-@ clicking on the piece and editing : select review or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the review in the Edit Metad@@ ata dialog .
the developers do not want to show you when to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means that K@@ DE packages have a specified release plan that cannot be combined with Amar@@ ok &apos;s short @-@ term plan .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can easily find ner@@ vi@@ g . de@@ activate the option icon when playing animated in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Set@@ ting up Pre@@ ferences ... and take the desired changes there .

Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and thus a lot of error reports .
probably was &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you must configure and install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re @-@ installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
you probably have to install a distribution that separates the development files from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files are missing . you now have to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same goes for x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you have to re@@ compile and install Amar@@ ok .
I receive the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you will need to compile your Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : don &apos;t use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I receive the There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad .
you will get the There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok to use the second sound card ?
set up with Settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio output you specify the device . typically , for example h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ pp@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ intel@@ pp@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 } c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter us@@ b @-@ audio in the setup dialog of x@@ ine and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the check@@ box supported by sound card m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be taken care of . you can of course gladly take this issue by yourself ! if you would like , you can become the new so much needed support for arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard , which will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok . if you want to upgrade your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very easy . drag and drop items from the collection browser to the playlist . the small text box to filter the collection makes it easier for you to search for certain pieces . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save them using the playlist &apos;s button under saving . you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the playlist to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . by right @-@ clicking on a playlist , you will find various ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , please select Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD tracks in WAV format . simply drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and then press the Play button .
the audio CD feature uses the Audi@@ oc@@ d protocol : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . just click with the right mouse button on an entry and follow the burning menu . you have here various ways to burn a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally , some extra packages are listed that make the work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more enjoyable .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important features . additionally , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all others . the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Center . at the top of the window is a run text display showing the current running piece or the current stream . just below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sample rate of the current piece . a click on this area changes the display of the previously expi@@ red playing time to the remaining time of play .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , even under the drive text display . you can switch from the available analy@@ zer by right @-@ clicking on the area .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ fying window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also included under the running text display . the PL button activates or de@@ activates the play@@ lists window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set up E@@ quali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece @-@ position sli@@ der . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the play position or volume . with the playback buttons you can start / stop playing and change to the next or previous piece .
using the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own default settings .
to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the equ@@ ali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok playlist ; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that are not available in any other player . but don &apos;t let the wealth of features deter you , they &apos;re all easy to use .
the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left is the navigation pane . in the navigation pane , you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right you find the playlist itself .
the context browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with context browser design . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , Text and Interpre@@ t . these three sub@@ windows will be explained in detail later .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the sub@@ window is dropped off . the information presented there are now distributed in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . in addition , the information can be viewed in the statistics window ( Extras statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first area in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title you will find the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you can see the cover image of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to recre@@ ate the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
below the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current piece . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to display cover images in the context browser , the covers must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ n@@ g are supported . the images can have any name but pictures with the word front in the name are treated prefer@@ enti@@ ally . the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on any of these pieces , it will play immediately .
among the pieces recommended are the favourite pieces of this artist . this area shows the five highest scores of the current artist .
you can set which information to display in the music sub@@ window . to do so , right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums from the current artist you have in your collection . when you click on an album , it will work up and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also right click on it and then select one of the possibilities to add the play or album to the playlist from the context menu .
this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is yet running , you can choose which one to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s collection database . no running text script is needed to do so .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group interpre@@ ts - only group the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored .
group Interpre@@ t / Album - First the pieces are sorted by artist and among them will be a further division according to the respective album . if you want to see compil@@ ations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums will be shown at the beginning of the list under different interpre@@ ters .
group Interpre@@ t / Year - Album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default is 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are arranged alphabe@@ tically by each other . the artist will be ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - Your pieces are displayed first by genre and among them by artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the artist .
with the remaining buttons you can customize and combine group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re@@ count your collection once you change something on the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while .
a search filter is located directly under the toolbar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes on how to use this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter there is a sel@@ ector with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . there are different time windows available , starting from the last 24 hours up to a year . in addition , you can also choose your complete collection , which makes the filter practically switched off .
clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser gives you the following options .
load - This emp@@ ties the current playlist and adds the selected pieces to playback in the current order .
attach to Play@@ list - Ad@@ just the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry you will get the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name to save the list .
transfer to media player - Add the pieces to the queu@@ es for the media player . more details can be found in the section on the Media Player Browser .
burn all pieces of this interpreter / Burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and either burned as data or as audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the piece information dialog and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) Move the files into the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark the compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears under different interpre@@ ters .
picking up a compilation - Chan@@ ges a album marked as a compilation back into a normal album . after that , the album will no longer be displayed under different interpre@@ ts , but again under the corresponding performer .
the Play@@ lists browser makes it easy to deal with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes Intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at runtime . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window Media Player is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist sorted in the top list view of the media player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list performer . when you &apos;re done , click Apply . by doing that , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . if the commit completes , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive commitment to your iPod .
under the toolbar , there is a search area that allows you to search for a file . the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from an entered URL . if you want to tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press Enter , you can drag and drop music from there to the playlist .
when the playlist is longer than it is in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping it . in that case , holding down the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply drag and drop the entries with the mouse to the desired location . as soon as you enter letters there are only the pieces that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button for as long as the text field is empty again .
if you enter search terms separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one or two , the search will find all entries containing one , two and three .
if you enter OR between the search terms , search for entries containing either one or the other search term . for example , one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces containing one or two or three are found ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose bum@@ ps : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that include Mike Old@@ field , but not by entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : review : &gt; 50@@ . This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific keyword , set a minus sign before the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variants as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this search for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field or a higher rating than 50 and not include the comment bath .
you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ trl key , and then right @-@ click in the desired order to click the entries . the entries then receive a mark with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist . it includes buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left you will find the Add button to add pieces to the playlist . to the right , you will find play@@ lists , empty play@@ lists and Rand@@ om@@ ph mixing .
next , the buttons will follow und@@ o and restore , so you can und@@ o or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the toolbar there is a unique , magni@@ fied analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as what you see in the player window using the right mouse button . via this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more buttons available for the toolbar , such as playback control and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbar buttons .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval , a sli@@ der for the play position and the playing time of the current play will be changed .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the playlist in the playlist . via this menu you can click the Options of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
a click on this entry opens the visualization plugin window . there you can select the visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
this entry contains a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the Cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left .
with the View menu you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select from :
the queue management received your big entry in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , the playlist will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
when you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces to the playlist or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which have already been pre @-@ set ( the details on how to set up these later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds further random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a load .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
double click on the playlist you want , drag it to the playlist window or click with the right mouse button and then select Load . so , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist .
the two pres@@ et modes Rand@@ om mix and playlist mix instantly popul@@ ate your playlist and you can start playing directly . the list of recommended pieces begins with an empty playlist and you have to add at least one piece by yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces are added at the next piece change , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as starting point . using the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can also be disabled again .
the New button automatically popul@@ ates the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . editing a playlist opens a dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist gives you the option to click Edit . after that , the dialog box will open to edit the playlist &apos;s settings .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will be continually growing , the setting for future pieces will be ski@@ pped and you will not hear a piece dup@@ licate in this playlist . if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed in observ@@ ance of the settings .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces were recently played .
this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 , then the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the right side settings have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random items from each of the play@@ lists you have crossed .
some scripts enable your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click on Set@@ ting .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts by clicking on the install script . a selection dialog will open in which a script package can be selected for installation . after you have installed the script , a new script will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you no longer wish to use a script , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to delete and then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please refer to the writing section of Scrip@@ ts .
the visualization plugin dialog window is used to activate available visu@@ ali@@ zations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this Quick Start will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps you need to create an audio CD . to understand the steps you need to have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that when you re @-@ encoding to MP3 , you will get a worse quality no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created by a los@@ sy format . use the project au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect .
in this dialog box , you can do nothing . please wait until the machine has completed the burning process .
this Quick Start will show you how to copy &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and insert the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , Copy CD ... from the menu . you will now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have done all the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you will now see a dialog box that looks like this :
in this dialog box , you can track the progress of the copy process . once the reading of the original is done in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to which the data should be burned .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .

the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is available at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org , where you will receive the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , where you can get feedback on community help from the forums and get news .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; therefore sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs out . in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality for burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patented and professional technology for audio encoding and for dealing with audio streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and encoder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ MPEG , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : other libraries for processing various audio formats . with FF@@ MPEG , for example , it is possible to de@@ code WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ x Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
Trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ Ma@@ ger : a full @-@ featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can e.g. make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces play differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to be able to start from CD and to automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . click on an entry to open the project .
save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new filen@@ ame .
save the current project under a new filen@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s Di@@ alogue Save As appears to allow you to choose folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you were going to save file for each project file .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . you can then choose between saving and changes . you can also ab@@ ort the closing and keep the project open .
closes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will en@@ qu@@ ire for any un@@ saved project that is supposed to happen , just as if you had called for each project file close .
closes all opened projects and termin@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for any un@@ saved project will be asked what to do with it as if you had called file closing .
when you access this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this will have the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the Project View . if the current project is a data CD , the files added will appear in the CD &apos;s base folder .
opens the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by the What is the ? remedy described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you merge files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data from the previous session will always be included even if this feature is not used . it is intended for you rather than help to view the files and folders that already exist on the medium .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function does not remove files from the media , it only dis@@ closes the previously imported files .
this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a CD which you can then burn later on . you should also prefer cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
open the DVD Copy dialog . this allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without project file . alternatively , you can only create an image of a DVD which you can then burn later . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . furthermore , the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD + R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes review and incre@@ mental .
burn a previously created CD image . the dialog will prompt you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog will ask you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burn button .
a previously used DVD video can be converted . this dialog window will usually appear after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the selected video , encoding settings , and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the content view and contains features of the medium , such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of the toolbar of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is checked , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is enabled , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media Info , Lo@@ cking and Un@@ locking the disk or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the content view allows selecting and dra@@ gging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header is a narrow area that is only visible when the projection screen contains open projects . the header has no real function , it only looks nice and separates the project view from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box to change key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , the key assignment can be adjusted further below .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; Setup Wizard . this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this purpose system administrator privileges are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) at the start of the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b should work right away . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and fine @-@ tune the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled , for example , via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can use either the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and type of task is crucial , which of the included programs will give you the default .
in this chapter we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to be able to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions common to all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in common , support &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts which are described below .
the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b standard D@@ CO@@ P interface provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Activ@@ ate CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , you can create a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above @-@ listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String parent ) void ur@@ l ( K@@ URL : : list ur@@ ls , Q@@ String parent ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String parent ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String path ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folders :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; Audio CD ; it can easily be read and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on encoder installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ Creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that en@@ code these wa@@ v files ( these enco@@ ders are still being installed from the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into mp3 or O@@ GG format or other formats like the los@@ sy FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ Creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . all of these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is probably not necessary to compile something yourself . however , if FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
what encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and comp@@ ressing factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; audio @-@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device prevents the protection , it is not possible to circum@@ vent protected audio CD ; even avoid the mechanisms of copy protection . just avoid purchasing copy protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up has to be done only once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , afterwards the daily usage for reading a &amp; CD ; on the hard drive explains . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you will frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert to many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; fetch information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , where everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . in the step by step example , you will find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tabs for configur@@ ing the program .
CD@@ DB En@@ quiry into CD data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
start reading and - if an encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup Cat@@ alog - encoding .
open a sub @-@ menu with a list of enco@@ ders available , so that the selection can be read with another encoder than the default . note that the encoding settings in the encoding settings tab have been configured in the setup dialog before .
opens the file manager so that an already selected file is selected for encoding rather than a full &amp; CD ; read and encoding .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pic@@ s ) for program events ( such as read out the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
open the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audio@@ Creator ; with different card flash@@ cards ( such as En@@ co@@ der , setting up the encoder ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly any commercially available commercial devices that can play these files .
among audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on your psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in audio quality at lower bit rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit rate , the differences become less important as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open licensing issues
+ High to very high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) , but slightly lower quality compared to O@@ GG with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG voting machines exists .
MP3 - if music should also be listened to on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression ratio around 5.5 . requires 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 kb@@ ps for all tracks of a song . good enough for music from you@@ ths , portable devices and car park facilities . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or retri@@ eved by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ audio@@ Creator ; and the encoding program to generate folder and file names as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here . the manual or the help of the encoder explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ Creator ; parameters needed ( = button lab@@ eling in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter information , so that all others can download the information instead of yourself . it is important to note that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal but I ( note of the translator ) is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent that you from the &amp; CD ; information published on the CD ; more or less worth@@ less so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained anyway with a bum@@ ble@@ bee through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ Creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems that the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( but this can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ Creator ; used to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; . alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know it more precisely , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CDs ; see note is that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed first from the appropriate distribution if this has not yet happened .
for saving the read wa@@ v files , the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected . at first opening there are predefined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set the encoder . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the package must be installed from the related Linux distribution before the encoder can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . for more information on Ko@@ di@@ erer , refer to the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a encoder , more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and reading rights on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not work !
there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 keywords ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution , for example , a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found with a search engine as it is considered non @-@ completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write privileges on it ( eg by trying to copy something in it ) .
the first section covers the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audio@@ Firmware ; , something that is likely to be done only once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD .
here we define the enco@@ ders for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change it every time you read a &amp; CD ; change if once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is handed over to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries present on the device desig@@ nations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card card General Settings . here there is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be left as shown / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
please select only for incomplete information , so that you will be informed if information on creating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the card CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and allow the &amp; CD ; download data automatically via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection field is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; . this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filen@@ ames or tag records , they can easily be changed . the directory and file name will be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ aming and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you download the database before . however , this is over 6@@ 20 MB , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . put everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
they both function equivalent to the server , since many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 , because the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example we don &apos;t want to transfer data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice .
simply take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure that the / tmp folder exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously reading pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try it yourself .
CD ; disc@@ ard after reading the last piece : check this to the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget that folder if you want to do something yourself with the wa@@ v files .
enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is average about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression ratio is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if needed . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of subsequent change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneous to enco@@ ded wa@@ v files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be attempted to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ Creator ; finished . this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
in this section it describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk runs out . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was described in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is structured , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b must be picked up . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each reading &amp; CD ;
since we use a &amp; CD ; use that is not yet in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look somewhat different than those obtained for a CD ; with successfully fet@@ ched data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually enter data instead of fet@@ ching them from the internet . comments will point to the differences .
do not try the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; can be identified as an audio CD ; and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , look for the help section in the Questions and Ans@@ wers section or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there , a window appears , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ;
if you did not select the check box for the automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the toolbar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the &apos; Album &apos; input field .
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the &apos; Current title &apos; input field unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the bottom comment field can be used for each commentary volume individual per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply common to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album names ( e.g. whether all words with upper@@ case letters begin or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece , and only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you will have unlimited field length , at least for what &amp; audio @-@ Creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set to the &apos; Basic Settings &apos; tab .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all coding or file formats . see the help of the encoder to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously complies with the style of the read @-@ out CD ; in this example , this is not important as we don &apos;t provide the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after choosing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece in any case and any other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the song data of the &amp; CD ;
note : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button on the toolbar . note that the artist and the album will be shown above the parts list .
note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece one or off . make sure that all pieces are selected , or press the All items button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at a time .
when you click on the selection button to read the selection process , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what &apos;s going on .
click on the tab Or@@ ders to switch to the order window . it is located in the left upper half of the window , just below the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to control the jobs . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
you will see this error message if you try to work with a encoder that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the job list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error oc@@ cured immediately after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the job 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : contract 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into MP3 format . thus , read out and encoding at the same time . note the status message at the bottom of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that appears to be configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and encoding . the resulting machine with an AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have any problem at simultaneous reading and encoding ( of though two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is placed in the queue of the encoder . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window is displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio@@ Firmware ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . res@@ p . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoder of your choice .
if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , there &amp; k@@ audio@@ Creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you are reading this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is directed to people who compile from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be customized to your needs , then the following is true for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many settings . it &apos;s best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the different tabs of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any clu@@ e as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program start ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it all about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is the first version for a manual for &amp; k@@ audio@@ Creator ; thought . whoever wants to add or change something useful , may it . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore in agreement with this suggestion .
strange if you managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; beside others it has real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of lyrics also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players have not .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs on &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and k@@ de ; support also the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is involved as soon as it supports a sequence .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphic representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window on k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards for storing text in MIDI files ( song events or tex@@ tual events ) . k@@ mid automatically calcul@@ ates the process used .
session Support . when you quit &amp; k@@ de ; when playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song the next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button on the toolbar , select the entry Remove from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid window . ( for several pieces , you will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
once you play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and moving back and forth with the controller .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows left and right of the template and change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double @-@ click the template LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a play is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the pause button or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item , so interrup@@ ts the play .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text events , others use song tex@@ tures and others . some songs don &apos;t have any text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type will automatically determine which one song is used , so that you do not need to manually adjust the selected kar@@ aoke text , but you still have the option to change it if you want to see the other type .
if you want to set an event type , select the menu events and / or songs from the Settings menu . the same function also has the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summari@@ ze . these are played back in series . in this section you can find how you can efficiently use collections .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find it in the menu item under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specifying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired size in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be saved . keep in mind when you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song with the Add button . it appears in turn the file dialog , with which help you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Add to Collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection while opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
if automatic add @-@ on to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . the collection will then be added to the remaining pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you have to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu Ab@@ play sequence of the menu items , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the select list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump one song further , select the next song &apos;s button next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to jump reverse a song , select the button Item number , the entry Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter since it is not stored when leaving .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesi@@ zers , which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI map is transl@@ ating general MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in the events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and always lets you sound a trumpet when a piano was originally to play .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all the sound cards GM are compatible ( including A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM radio devices and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all required settings for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as many times as you wish . but the requirement is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ... EN@@ D
you can see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email so that I can offer in future releases of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
in this section , you specify how General MIDI cartridges are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general usage looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equals sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you can &apos;t change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument need to put on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) which sounds similar to a gun .
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( bul@@ let ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is the term drum @-@ patch of the patch , where each sound represents another percussion instrument ( drum , bas@@ ins , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify how tones are m@@ apped on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of rows is very important , as well as their presence .
you can define several key maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key maps are used above all to map the sounds on the perc@@ ussions channel . see , for example , the provided Key@@ maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swa@@ p the first and second channel , simply do this in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map with the name name for this channel will be used . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will try to change the patch on this channel .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if so , a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , this is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file no decim@@ al comm@@ a is standing ) .
this setting is needed because GM gives a keyboard that is supposed to play a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , to play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two sounds up to one oc@@ tave up . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog , which can be found in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole string of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a select list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button does not light green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view the View menu under the point channel view : settings
the pace LCD indicates the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 K@@ b while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer , you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid . this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; compiled without AW@@ E support . to remove the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; Drag &amp; Drop . simply open the folder that you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
be sure to activate Automatic Add to Collection . otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the standard tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or tack@@ ed ( when I play a kar@@ aoke file ) or I want to play a file , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding it to a collection , turn on the Automati@@ cally add to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . First you just want to play the first file . so set the setting Automatic Add to the collection and open A.@@ id@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file .
then decide to play B@@ mid and C.@@ M@@ ID and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , that anim@@ ates me to further write to &amp; k@@ mid .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . at the moment I am in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
they make me really happy when sending me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will count among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; however , before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me , since I may already have the file .
I &apos;ve written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and won &apos;t get money from anyone . I would therefore like to emphasize that I &apos;m only programming it because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .

a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , because the sound quality depends much on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile it and compile with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course not hear music .

the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called do@@ cking windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned .
it is possible to save preferred links under the Book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category permanent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you select an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the selected record .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , television and permanent play@@ lists can also be changed by direct editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do this if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / S@@ MB / , can be changed by an editor , and next edit mode . by clicking on a sub @-@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to select the playlist from the menu list and select either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without using the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player ; some features can only be enabled by changing XML configuration files .
the animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ last option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / S@@ Player / intro@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / S@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , this would be disturbing at the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; In@@ g dur &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / lt ; / \ ; / \ ; / \ ; / \ ; / \ ; / \ ; / \ ; / \ ; / \ ; / \ ; \ \ ; \ ; \ ; \ ; \ ; \ ; \ ; \ ; \ ; \ ; \ ; \ ;
there is a tab to configure M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for debu@@ gging is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the toolbar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of m@@ player visible .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , like setting up the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example how a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even include the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
in order for the &amp; KM@@ Player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player must be specified as a service provider for the Mim@@ e type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file Zu@@ orders of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library . the started process is called kn@@ p@@ player . if no errors occur here , the back@@ end issue is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
in order to always use a given back@@ end for a particular mim@@ e type ( of course only if it has been determined ) , this must be done by manual modification of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; KM@@ Player ; can play cards from TV , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be st@@ owed , the device to use and the TV channels must be configured . to do so , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog in Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port is to be used . there should be identified ports from which one is selected . the encoding must be found ( for example , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably contains a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support for S@@ MB can only be used by X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . therefore , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , S@@ MB uses different names for the sources . at the time of creating this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ asset , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ resource , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ one . when enabled , they start playing the playlist .
are there indications how to qui@@ eter my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter if I play it off ( not on the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be run as a user root after the device is plug@@ ged in . it is essential to ensure that / dev / c@@ drom is shown on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts slow , why does my CPU have to be tested for performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ l. k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically takes the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; Ki@@ le ; requires .
L@@ ate@@ x ; : a professional typ@@ ing application . under Unix @-@ like systems , probably the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) is used .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution should be included in the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; -@@ website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users probably don &apos;t have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the Ki@@ le ; -@@ Website .
if you have any questions regarding the compilation of &amp; Ki@@ le , or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides the ability to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and customized access to all &amp; latex ; programs . furthermore , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; latex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project administration need to be called .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and learn about its possibilities , the manual can be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working directly with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate directly with reading the chapter .
for &amp; latex ; is the proper pron@@ unciation : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is very difficult to use , a lay@@ man can also use latex ; a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while only a good overview of &amp; latex is given , it is not the ultimate book . to be able to properly control , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
just like other mark@@ up languages includes &amp; latex ; an introduction with which the general characteristics like paper format , page number@@ ing and text size are specified as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class , the body begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick @-@ En@@ try Wizard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for spe@@ edy preparation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; selecting the Assistant ( Men@@ tion ) offers some possibilities for creating the document . there may also be some settings related to the document .
document classes : this includes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : this defines the encoding of the system . modern systems increasingly use U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; latex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for &amp; latex ; for integration they only have to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with the German DIN regulations ) .
new users now don &apos;t have to worry about it . this is just a brief description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you want to see greater areas of a green text on the screen , it is quite lik@@ el@@ ihood that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , you will be spar@@ ed by the modest appearance of the output file .
with automatic execution of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically generates an empty line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line to the position of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set up in the menu Set@@ ting ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are normally divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph of the bottom element ) :
with the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; latex ; files can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; close to D e V ice I n@@ dependent file &#93; &#93; was created , jumps &amp; Ki@@ le ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; latex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of format@@ ted document and also other information such as font and is next to PDF the digital output tray of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices .
when troubleshooting the elements of the DVI ; file with the editor , and once cli@@ cked on an element in the DVI ; file , the corresponding section in the &amp; latex ; source code is j@@ umped . once cli@@ cked on a section in the &amp; latex ; source code is j@@ umped to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer .
master document : this feature is used for working with multiple files . with a master document , work with other embedded .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set over project project settings .
quick Construction : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there is no error in the source code ) .
video surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is on the ton@@ n@@ der@@ ung@@ â and it is not called up &amp; oc@@ ular ; after the quick @-@ construction .
when viewing the Edit tool bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for fast insertion of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the quick classification of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; latex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection field Other is for inser@@ ting items such as tags , foot@@ notes or references . the available options include :
name : with this command a name for a section , a picture or different element is created .
cover : used for reference to a specified term ( selection possible via a selection field ) .
using quotation marks a selection list with literary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files are appropriate editors necessary . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box labeled Gr@@ Ã ¶ BE@@ e is used for the definition of the font . the fonts can be specified for the main text , the description notes , etc . the following fonts are available :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and legend of settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch by hand .
the brackets after the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font width . if the font is not specified at the beginning , this can also happen in the text .
once you have entered the above source code , the &amp; latex must be compiled ; the simplest way to do this is to use the Start Building or the Quick Construction Button .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically exec@@ utes the storage .
if the compilation of the document fails , it should be looked for in the logging of the errors . when using quick @-@ construction , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be followed .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font name 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will allow the ann@@ ot@@ ation of the fonts within the environment as well as &quot; Ries@@ ling &quot; ( English Hu@@ ge ) .
changes are only carried out within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } until \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fonts , bold type , ital@@ ics , sub@@ stro@@ kes , etc . , can be added . these commands end with the \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the ital@@ ics pressure and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } in ital@@ ics .
\ \ quot@@ a : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background for writing the source text was presented with the &amp; latex ; mark@@ up language , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
as soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard , some adap@@ tations should be made for better read@@ ability of the document . this should include a quotation , a few passages in bold and ital@@ ics , and a poem to the application to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , Editor View or C@@ trl E can be returned to the editor ( for the internal viewer ) . in an external viewer , the window has to be closed .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; post@@ script ; / PDF file . simply try it and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( English D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps are necessary as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can be printed ( in the viewer ) by file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; latex ; source code , the conversion into desired formats can start using the buttons in the toolbar .
the preview search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; -@@ Bin@@ ding files . to do this , just set up Modern under Settings Box ... Building tools can be balanced .
to run the preview search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be cli@@ cked in a line of the source text and then cli@@ cked on the previous search . the jump to the corresponding point in the DVI ; viewer will then take place .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; latex ; document from &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and j@@ umped to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; set up as text editor ( Set up ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if there is no error in using the Quick Building of the &amp; DVI ; the viewer may have an error . if there is an error , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the logging file explains the source of errors in the source code . in the editor you can then use the Rel@@ ative La@@ Te@@ X error and N@@ Ã ¤ d@@ First La@@ Te@@ X error for jumps between the errors . in order to view the faulty line , the error in the logging must be cli@@ cked and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the faulty line .
once clicking on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template to use for the document . the default options include :
when selecting an empty document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document . more information is included in the section .
height users of &amp; latex ; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; Ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be open or create a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document ... create .
when creating a new document from a template by file New , some strings will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings Box ... Settings can be set in general .
when creating your own template it is necessary to know which strings will be replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entry into document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ &#93; { items } .
the simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be executed :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard one .
a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files are created . if a simple way to create a template is scann@@ ed , it should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below are searched .
&amp; k@@ ate ; used as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; can be made in the menu directly from &amp; Ki@@ le ; out .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to learn about its possibilities , the manual must be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start reading the chapter &apos;s work with the Editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; begin .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference which can be called via the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains a detailed description of nearly all the commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; use as well as their syntax .
double click with pressed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that by clicking on \ \ par the \ \ par \ \ big@@ skip is only \ \ par .
when dra@@ gging the text with a left mouse button , the selected text will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with the Shift key pressed , parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse most different kinds of source code and highlight these . for example , the &amp; latex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands differ from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color .
many assistants can hold additional jump marks . this is a separate type of book@@ mark within the text . the menu items Edit jumping brands or the corresponding ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes allow the jump to the next or last jump stamp . this is also highlighted by this jump stamp so that it is automatically detected at the first input of a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already excellent options include , were included in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; source text added . &amp; latex ; frequently supports many environments and groups and therefore supports &amp; Ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection .
select a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only explo@@ iting thing in &amp; Ki@@ le is that the text is separated by two empty lines .
choose the word from the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also includes &amp; latex ; commands with a return string ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , nat@@ ally it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ate ; offers the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with its own commands for faster possibility . under Edit Removal the following commands are included to delete the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is contained in the description to edit select paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore offers &amp; Ki@@ le ; for other commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with &amp; latex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the surroundings of the environment .
if the cursor is located before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , j@@ umped to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many ne@@ sted environment commands , the overview can quickly be lost . this command will close the last opened environment so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also provides special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups which are determined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from edit environment .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the opened bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closed clamp .
if the cursor is on or behind the cur@@ ly bracket of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , j@@ umped to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted groups bra@@ ces , the overview can quickly be lost . this command will close the last opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple reference marks are used as a device . for the practical implementation , the character is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; is used for two simple reference marks . &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and supports two closing quotes for &amp; latex ; one .
this automatic insertion of the double quotes can be set up under Settings Box ... Let La@@ Te@@ X be switched on and off .
it can also be used to customize specific settings ( e.g. French or french ) and there@@ with German or French quotes . there are also many other languages available .
when pressing Shift ; Enter key for &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line breaks but also the \ \ item command .
enter the current line with \ \ \ \ with a close line break in a table environment .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or custom environments . you can set up under Settings Box ; Set Up ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
some users would like to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thus all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to make this possible . when pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab , add &amp; Ki@@ le ; some space for the columns position of the current tab .
although &amp; k@@ ate ; already a good source code distribution offers , this in &amp; Ki@@ le ; to include special commands ( mostly for &amp; latex ; ) . there are three different modes installed . three of them work according to need and the other two are designed for automatic execution . all of these modes can be set up for different modes of work under Settings Box ...
at the beginning a new environment is added using the command \ \ begin { surrounding } &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { Environment } to an empty line ( for text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and possibly the default list is removed . on the other hand , the list may also shrink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed by selecting a command . alternatively , from &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps can also be included , so that a jump to these positions is possible by the Edit jumping mark Next jump stamp , and the desired parameters can then be included .
under Pre@@ ferences Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; can be done settings to these lists . there may be different list lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands as well as wi@@ per books of the general language used .
the command mode is not useful for the execution of environments . always a few letters with \ \ begin are entered and the calling of the default mode will result in a large list with environment commands . on the other hand , the surroundings are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for the completion of the environments .
the command to open the environment is automatically folded and it appears \ \ begin { . thereafter , the ambient support can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button .
once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once you know that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be added .
under Settings Box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; can be done settings to these lists . this mode uses the W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ List of the full @-@ state mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of clip@@ boards , which can be replaced immediately by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings Box ... Ki@@ le can be set up . as an example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X entry is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word finishes on the Edit menu , the character L is replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
great offices are not helpful for automatic execution . however , it has been established that many more offices are written more than once in a document . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the complete termination for all previously written books .
this mode can be set up in the menu Set@@ ting ... Ki@@ le can be disabled . here also the threshold for displaying the default is specified .
the default files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / of the local home folder . mode stands for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation , dictionary ( dictionary ) or tex .
the dialog graphics display the import of graphics as simple as possible . to the overview of the basics of the graphic formats , the sections should be considered and followed .
PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files but offer an excellent basis for changes and new arrangements of pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
in order to examine the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the form of compilation , creating conversion and creating view .
for comp@@ iling the source text for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by pressing Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI ; file can be viewed in the standard viewer by means of old ; 3 , by means of old ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file and viewed by means of Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the quick @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will be opened each time .
a new project is about the project New Project .... This involves asking the following information for the project :
when defining the filen@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the Script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows to execute EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed by scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be changed in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) with the following methods :
&amp; latex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help for support of users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; supplied with many documents . included are a documentation for the included packages and a further &amp; latex ; -@@ reference .
it is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete manual for the &amp; latex ; commands contain and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc , which contains a database with all documents and boxes ; delivered documents and there@@ for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or banners . from &amp; Ki@@ le ; then only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer to the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; source text editor that can be installed on all systems with an installed &amp; k@@ de ; desktop environment . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , which &amp; Ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; with OS X installed .
many thanks to those who strive for the continued existence of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project aiming and sacrific@@ ing many hours for the development of tools which we all can use under observ@@ ance of the &amp; GNU ; license .

anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows my pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s raise it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer depends on a terminal ; just click the icon for the XML processor and done !
this application requires a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is located in the ear@@ thy working folder , let the current working folder be selected . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the other folder .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted each time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
as already said , anyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , its file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply cli@@ cked . if not , delete the file from the current file and select the file to be reviewed by other file - file selection .
if you just want to know if the file well @-@ formed is formed , click the Well @-@ formed review option .
to use an &amp; DT@@ D ; , which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition @-@ UR@@ I ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG review is specifying the Defini@@ tions @-@ UR@@ I ; in the file selection required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; -@@ processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is already selected , then the current file is simply selected . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed by the other file selection .
enter the name of the file as the result should have named . the file is normally stored in its home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , have a lot to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can immediately profit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone uses the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . you can find the plug @-@ ins in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start with the Edit but@@ s menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all contained plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a location , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , this path leads to the search of the plug @-@ in .
many people often work on one project in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves as a unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as sub@@ project leaders .
the user can look for himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the button called S@@ etze . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears in bold as they are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important with regard to messages and notes . see for further information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
besides an overview of their team there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see in for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone was working on or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that enters a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the event configuration page of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog can create , edit and delete events .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the address can be a team or sub@@ project manager .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
to enter comments is simple . it can be either the re@@ mark entry from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword can be entered in a comment field followed by comment text .
comments can be sent to a designated member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , whereby nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the team member is , role played in the project from the following possibilities :
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper@@ case or lower@@ case , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus but specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in .
the settings can be set up using Qu@@ anta settings ... This dialog extends over some pages that are treated one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , regarding tags including code completion can be changed with this . the entries are :
large / Low Description of tags : large / lower case of automatically inserted tags . normal size / lower@@ case means the tags are inserted as described in the tag XML files .
large / lower@@ case attributes : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal size / lower@@ case means the attributes are inserted as described in the tag XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if attached , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not include optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
automatically update the start and end tag : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding coding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for det@@ ecting various types of files . by pressing the Standard button , the default settings can be restored .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening of open files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting is removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected . however , this setting is displayed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , periodic@@ ally created backup copies so that the document can be recovered from this backup during a power ou@@ tage or crash . this is not the same as saving the file .
previ@@ ewing and documentation can be displayed either in the editor pane or in your own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
reset window def@@ aults to default when the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by modi@@ fying M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the alert area is used to control the display of warnings by enabling non @-@ poll@@ s .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL . it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL and the source text view in shared mode . see the different modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree representing the figure of the par@@ ser nodes in the document can be set in detail .
in the area of the mouse click on the structure tree the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree .
in the Struc@@ ture Tree pane , the visibility of nodes in the tree , the frequency of updating of the tree during processing and how deep in a change in the structure tree should be automatically opened . empty nodes are the empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
the range for setting short@@ cuts ( a kind of templates ) which is un@@ folded when editing to larger text . abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means that there can be a valid group for PHP where the C@@ HER@@ E clause means something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug@@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are part @-@ applications from third site , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ enabled application , the most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
loading a component in the &quot; Read @-@ only &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only read @-@ up parts usually refuse the load if this option is not selected .
check the plugin : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , if the entered information is correct . select allows saving of the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from version 3.3 , troubleshooting has been completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer required built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) debu@@ gger has been adjusted , as well as the support for the DB@@ G debu@@ gger . instead of this a debu@@ gger plugin concept has been implemented that allows different implem@@ entations via plug@@ ins .
currently only one plug @-@ in is available , the support for using &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inserts .
using the Deb@@ ug@@ ger for a project starts with selecting a suitable debu@@ gger plug @-@ in in project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ in sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed .
if a debu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left D@@ ock .
a view in which all holding points are listed , with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the debu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the debu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action the connection to the debu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it shares the plugin to listen to de@@ bug demands . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened which uses a debu@@ gger , so that you don &apos;t have to pay attention to it normally .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ ger session starts the session . closes the connection to the debu@@ gger or ends the listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to de@@ bug a debu@@ gging requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
instruc@@ ts the debu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens , while the script is hal@@ ted , the execution will continue . if the script is started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the debu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without inform@@ ing variables and the current line number . if this happens , while a script is hal@@ ted , the execution continues . if it happens before a debu@@ gger request is given , the execution starts as soon as a request is made .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include in the script .
instruc@@ ts the Deb@@ ug@@ ger to skip the instruction and go to the next one as if the current one is not .
opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .

this chapter describes how you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can adapt to your needs and how you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can help to become better .
document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . used to provide support for mark@@ up and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS . their simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folder includes two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folder are handy , symbol @-@ oriented led@@ ges of image buttons ( above the editing pane ) that insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever have .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion .

Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for the tag . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without a risk of writing error .
tag folder are nothing but folders . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder bears the name of the description language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the tag XML and declares if they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better view and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but an element type about itself otherwise nothing .
the type of the tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . specifies the name of the class to which this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
when yes , the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to any other day . ( only Family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of the attribute . additionally it contains additional tags describing how to display this attribute , etc ; This is a single element type element .
specifies the source code used to fill in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to reach source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to reach the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface name and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current day .
a container tag that groups the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
sets the attribute text of a tag within a dialog box . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a single element type .
specifies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a only element type .
all tag XML files must begin with one &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; replace . this will not cause a leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is in the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to choose another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions will follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check takes place only when loading the Tag@@ ged XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in the following an example for a family 1 tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ schema . the filen@@ ame for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 tags XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the filen@@ ame of this tag@@ XML file will be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor available for editing via DT@@ D Edit DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should create a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = U@@ sed 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... to be created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
the key short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the User Defin@@ ed button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 the current short@@ cut is removable .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when the action is executed , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) , which change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , even are the Schnell@@ start dialog or the various See in ... actions for ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , try to find the script in the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . if from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . if only one instance is running , the text will be unique to the PID # . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the parameters for this event , usually the filen@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script input of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is available ; in the input field input can be determined what to send to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only meaningful with this setting .
the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages sent to the standard output . it can be specified , what should be done with the text written on the default output by setting the value to the output field output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group . in any given case , there are not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar .
complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan to use them , enable &quot; Edit tag &quot; dialogue if available so that entering the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels as default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created icon does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the day launch , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user is sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ gt ; -@@ tag will insert in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it still has to be connected with the action . this happens through the menu with settings set actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags , so there are still some , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , functions to the toolbar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separ@@ ators . open the toolbar settings dialog via Settings Tool@@ bar . make sure that the desired toolbar is selected .
after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the toolbar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar has to be tested by absorbing all the icons in order to make sure everything works .
if new XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust your file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that your toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( will ) when a file is opened by the corresponding folder .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or format@@ ting language that you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory if someone has already done that for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you have to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . we &apos;ll leave the first part to you , the second we will treat here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , for documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the Main Index Top Element = your description for these documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 documentation section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html tag 2 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see the PHP manual now ; documentation like this :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Intro@@ duction , ... Intro@@ duction = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except through reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it out yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; Fol@@ der is displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files are replaced .
the contents section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file that is used for creating context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing one &amp; PHP ; scripts to display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by marking the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context menu ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of text @-@ separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your doc@@ r@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as specified in your doc@@ r@@ c file ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure they are good and worthy to be shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the failing resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , toolbar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners , or anyone else . there is an email @-@ sending menu item such as DT@@ D DT@@ D @-@ Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , Tool@@ bar Tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the Scrip@@ ts tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive from where any other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , users can download it . the contributions will be checked and made available only if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication . to make a significant contribution we recommend to sign the resources , for which there is a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of resources is guaranteed for both our team and the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for your private g@@ p@@ g key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have several keys , you can select one . in the Add New Resource dialog you have to fill in the input fields ( URL preview may remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be up@@ loading from the menus of the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , up@@ loading tool bar toolbar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the template and script tree .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in case of problems , it warns and it can then be cancelled . if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed , a message appears with the statement of the source of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . however , the creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files in XML format could be necessary . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the menu DT@@ D Load and Con@@ vert a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . then the following dialog appears :
destination directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folders .
! Doc@@ type Definition line : the string that appears in ! Doc@@ type Day , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand these and to draw full advantage of them , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring these concepts closer to them without their understanding &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , local and project related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . all that is globally marked is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this enables the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use the user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project . simply put , this is the most constra@@ ined size . all elements are stored in the project tree of the project , resulting in the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree view , the index tabs with information and the tool@@ bars .
you can click on the tabs with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current document , such as closing , del@@ eting , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or exec@@ uting CVS commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the editor pane will lead to another context menu with regard to the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , editing the tag under the mouse poin@@ ter , or opening the file , when the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top end of the editor window is the tool bar of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of toolbar buttons is really easy . if you want to insert a simple tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . now , you can insert the data for this precisely inserted tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill out different fields in a dialog .
the Bau@@ man@@ tura ( Q@@ IT ; ) makes it possible to navigate in the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to navigate them and ro@@ am . in the presentation with tabs are available for files , project , templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be executed with the contex@@ tual menu then displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website , etc ; There are all possibilities open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . global templates are always available ; local templates are available only for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of spin @-@ off in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking on an element , a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears under the other tree views . with it can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces quickly . the application system aligned with the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D will be shown .
this tab shows all faults in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the appropriate command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is the ability to send a tool bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , sends the tool bar as compressed tar archive over &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool bar in an email , they can save and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this is why auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems starting with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 is located in the PAT@@ H in front of its bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is a web development tool for the K@@ DE desktop . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , was optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while the effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , an independent , exten@@ sible mark@@ up language editor would ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer confined to pure &amp; HTML ; constra@@ ined , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML , then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for this purpose , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
well , to the aforementioned claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of Why does anyone else develop ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only this all possible , but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ painted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more detailed documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either enter this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; currently being developed and managed by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest record being taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . check the section about templates . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project default folder , only one error is reported .
converted when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ write , so that they appear correctly and are not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction .
converts the text from the clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; sp@@ elling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
turn on the block selection . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script outputs error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and predefined expression to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scrip@@ tions and debu@@ gger .
starting and switching of the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as one changes to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the cursor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents are group@@ ed in the menu based on the filen@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
search through the project directory for new files that could be there . this enables , for example , to copy graphics files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the project manages the project . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you will find the details .
loads a project toolbar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : locally or Project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this only creates the name . actions must be set by setting actions ... are saved . toolbar buttons are stored on toolbar toolbar or you will be asked whether you want to save the toolbar .
removes a toolbar from the field of view . it does not delete it from the disk . if you have not saved the toolbar , you will be asked if you would like to do that .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( maybe the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team for the toolbar to be available in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment .
allows up@@ loading of toolbar to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
download &amp; DT@@ D ; which you or someone else has made and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . your own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P should be refres@@ hed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission is not present in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails .
this menu provides a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar . if the default ( HTML ; ) Tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu item in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current Tag Settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
activates or de@@ activates the intelligent insertion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , refuses to insert using tool bar when this tag contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plug@@ ins menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the menu items above . click on them .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the k@@ ate ; version .
select the type of line identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching may sometimes need time or cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub @-@ window . by selecting an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
activates the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . main window .
the changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
set the Edi@@ tor@@ f@@ enst@@ ers behavior . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate you will find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar , or which add and modify the sequences .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and licensed free , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , because , for example , after completing the project name , the entire directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties Properties .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name file , file is filled in automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower@@ case letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exam@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates for the project are saved . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set rather than the standard .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set rather than the standard .
this allows you to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. , PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be hoo@@ ked up . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook up .
with this option , all files and folders within the folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to good @-@ value .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the files you want by hooks or by removing the check@@ mark from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded using Project Properties menu in the menu tree in the Profile menu or Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) , which are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to above , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read in more about project views .
this means that the desired debu@@ gger can be selected . currently only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set with the Options button . in this case , troubleshooting is described .
in the sub@@ window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by pointing an own tree view for each profile .
in the Team Configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration window , you can turn on event actions and add , change or delete actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ defined event occurs , such as backing up a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus opens ; the last project that was opened . you can &apos;t influence this behavior at this time .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Project or the Project icon Open Project from the toolbar . the Open Di@@ alogue Project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives you free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders do likewise behave , but the entries are missing open and open with ... in context menu , which can be accessed with the right mouse button :
here different profiles can be chosen . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
enables removal of the current profile . if only one profile exists , the button will be removed to prevent the removal .
this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ safe password saved on disk is not in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply exit the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ loading profiles can be created to upload the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk concealed so that it can not be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can give many views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted from the Project or Project toolbar , accessible via the toolbar &apos;s toolbar project toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do the most . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
as mentioned above , tool bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus are best designed using the tool@@ bars menu . use and addition differ . adding of tool@@ bars is treated below in the addition of tool@@ bars .
the toolbar and the icons can be set using context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) in which new action , a new toolbar can be created , other actions such as tool@@ bars can be removed , toolbar can be renamed or tool@@ bars are executed , which can be displayed in the dialog where it can be specified , which actions should be visible on this or other toolbar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the actions will be removed and action processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings Tool@@ bars ... and set Settings . set .
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code @-@ cut@@ lets and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , uses templates basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or associate each existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specific documents will be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates . see in for more information on the template tree .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be included in the documents . you can find everything from a comment about a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl @-@ based . some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As Tem@@ plate Save As Local Tem@@ plate ....
once this is done , you will notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As a template save selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply be dra@@ gged with dra@@ gging and dropping onto the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied into a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or in the project file and select site template , enter and secure a name for the template . by default , it can be saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can pre @-@ give he@@ aders or foot@@ ers or dynamically combine with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . additionally , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the Sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above .
in order to specify the behavior of a folder , click on the folder with the right mouse button and select Properties in the Properties menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is bl@@ ended when par@@ ental attributes are cra@@ cked .
this is enabled by default and is suitable for everything except for the regular folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set in such a way , it would basically disable templates in this path unless it is explicitly enabled . if nothing appears , it will probably be in a root folder .
allows previous or copied text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers by copying table content templates into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
additionally you have a context menu ( show right mouse button ) over a full command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source Editor , which can be accessed via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; Editor and the second editor spl@@ its the editor window into two parts : the Source Editor and the V@@ PL ; Editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cursor appears . then , you can edit and rever@@ t to the source code editor if necessary , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document that contains &amp; PHP , a small green symbol shows the default of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit &amp; PHP ; it is still necessary to edit the source code editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that simultaneously the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; Editor synchron@@ ously . pressing F@@ 9 , this mode is already active , at the touch of a button the active cursor moves from one window to the other , whereby the position in the document is maintained .
the synchronization gap between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source editor can be set up using Qu@@ anta settings .... After choosing V@@ PL , you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in general , the recommendation is : a small gap for fast calcul@@ ators and a large span for slow ones .
let &apos;s assume that you want to change the title of the website , so editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor is also called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used to reduce the manual encoding .
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating the appearance of pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is not currently supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style sheet by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the corresponding file .
the cursor is as in a word processor , by moving the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor beha@@ ves strange . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and del@@ eting by means of a button or removal key .
the insertion of tags is done in the same way via the toolbar , as in the source editor . note that the insertion of tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted , surrounded with text , any other ar@@ mature tag must be removed .
some toolbar functions such as the T@@ ables Assistant or the Listen Assistant are disabled . they will work later in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and execution of style sheets can be tra@@ cked .
to successfully compile and install x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; still need lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml libraries that are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .
support in a template , at a point in a style or x@@ ml file loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g or the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , or@@ phan@@ ed holding points can be set in a specific file and line number and later enabled .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the complete path from a file name without path input . file names in the same folder as the top loaded still file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l loaded , the following entry is possible :
this command will examine a partial or total compliance with a template named QNAP or a given model name . &amp; eg ; template matches any QNA@@ P@@ cloud that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP NAS &quot; is expanded to the rules specified by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file : test@@ 1 will be test@@ 1 &amp; eg ; extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a raised stop point must be resolved for the appropriate UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically executed when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . holding points are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each run .
break -@@ l &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; nbsp ; nbsp ; ( Sets a break@@ point in the specified file and line number )

if a value is specified for the search@@ results option , all output files are stored in this folder . otherwise , the folder of the style template is used . by default , search@@ results are processed by search@@ .x@@ s@@ l , with the option &quot; pre@@ fre@@ eware &quot; search@@ ht@@ m@@ l@@ .x@@ s@@ l is used .
if the command &quot; search &quot; is executed , a x@@ ml file named search@@ results .x@@ ml will be created . this file can then be edited with a user @-@ defined style template to display the data in other form , If the option &quot; prefer@@ ential &quot; is not set , the search@@ .@@ txt file will be displayed .

on systems with the re@@ ad@@ line library installed , you can scroll up / down with the arrow keys to the previously executed commands .

there are many graphical tools for comparing . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was a lot of conflicts during mer@@ ging .
the program used by me showed only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no clu@@ e to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . bringing these changes was a small night@@ mare .
so that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , any number of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it in one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
3 @-@ way merge is also fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the merge editor under the Differ@@ ences windows enables resol@@ ving conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge the complete folder . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and resist@@ s the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check codes , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different .
if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , you can ease the typ@@ ing by simply typ@@ ing the file name of the first file . example :
diff@@ user Fol@@ der 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 -@@ o Dest@@ ner@@ 2 Share folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 -@@ o target folder
the Open dialog allows manual typ@@ ing of file names , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog recognizes your selection and displays them again next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences is performed with two files .
with the Fol@@ der button ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the comparing and / or mer@@ ging of folders is initiated . if a file is selected for A , however , a folder will be used for B and C , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the filen@@ ame from A in the other two folders .
when inter@@ cep@@ ting is enabled , the input field is active and can be edited . however , it is not absolutely necessary to specify an output file immediately . you can do this step later when saving .
the Setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in the opening dialog you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it drop over a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes , a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively large expense . you would need to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you cannot remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 . only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and past@@ ing ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data might be lost .
the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the filen@@ ame and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Each info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse over the line for a while . then a small help window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed using the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , you can see the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) good to see .
when differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . with some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare cases . )
the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line breaks are activated , the line is dotted with broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the wording appearing : , the filen@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you have processed the result . usually , it already contains text by automatic merge , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the jumps to the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the row will be marked in all windows and the first row of the group will be displayed . ( this will also make a jump of the position in the windows where the start of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will then be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merge or by manual editing ; this is only a plac@@ eholder in the case that you change your mind and perhaps again choose another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marking that you may copy and paste elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : if the options are ignored when selecting the sources , ignor@@ ing Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters .
navigate mainly with the image sequence and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side on , page beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
in the output window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . using the insertion button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the sum@@ m@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge and edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / C@@ trl @-@ picture ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ picture out@@ wards / C@@ trl @-@ picture Ab@@ forward ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict . therefore , there must be a distinction between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts .
to copy the marker to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . there is also the option Automati@@ cally Copy . if this is enabled , whatever you mark will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board and the manual copying is om@@ itted . however , be careful with this option because you could over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board accidentally .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix variants use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ AB@@ 3 does not maintain the line @-@ ends of the source files , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically during loading and restored at the next start . ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ AB@@ 3 Set up ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the selected script does not support this display , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be displayed straight . on these systems , the Pre@@ ferences button automatically adju@@ sts an un@@ just colour .
if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when the Tab key is pressed . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted .
when you press Enter or Return , the recur@@ r@@ ence of the previous line will be used automatically for the next line .
if this option is checked , every selection will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical rows in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . in this step , white characters will not be ignored . even when mer@@ ging , white characters will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only store a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . if this option is checked , carriage return signs could be made visible , however like a white mark . while mer@@ ging , this option must be disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
inten@@ sely for even smaller differences . the option is enabled by default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in automatic sequ@@ ential mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is progres@@ sed .
automatically dis@@ solves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) That &apos;s useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you need this only from time to time , then use the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments .
these options are treated in the chapter to scan folders and execute a merge . see for details under Docum@@ entation to Com@@ par@@ ison and Mer@@ ge .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you must &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart to make the change active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally over the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if enabled , the upper setting is used for all entries .
over the encoding fields for coding a short notice of what the local encoding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has an informal character for you . )
customize the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually configurable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding to use for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the default command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn on this to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in text or view columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded Excel column . but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . by selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will be shown next to the normal yet another polic@@ ing column with the required information .
sometimes you &apos;d like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply fill out the less important windows . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
arran@@ ges the comparison window next to each other or above . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
sometimes consider the differences and then un@@ expect@@ edly decide to merge the files . current file mer@@ ging in the merge menu works even if you only compare two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the filen@@ ame of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file it will first hand it to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your needs . you can use this function e.g. to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first given to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command . the output of the command is used only for line offset . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases , sed or per@@ l are sufficient .
use this command @-@ command for line reconciliation to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is a gra@@ ul@@ ary expression that matches any string and in this context refers to the found text in the first cl@@ amps . the \ \ U converts the found text into capital letters .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords for inser@@ ting automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all of them follow the same pattern $ keyword generated text $ . so , a pre @-@ processing command for line reconciliation is needed . the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for line reconciliation . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every line between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so basically deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at a time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like e.@@ g per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for displaying and mer@@ ging . other operations only change the data that the line @-@ off algorithm looks like .
note : in rare cases , if you are using a normal pre@@ processor , the line scanning pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal Pre@@ processor as input .
the pre @-@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hi@@ des differences , you may accidentally fail to notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often programmers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge , you can customize the proposal before the start ,
... can simulate the merge and displays the simul@@ ated changes without actually carrying out it ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the File dialog .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 will be used as a base . if no destination folder was specified , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will be used as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you have to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . )
while scanning the folders , a small message window informs you about the current progress . if you ab@@ ort the scan of the folders , only the files that have been compared until then are listed .
when scanning the folders is finished , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 shows a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is normally folded up . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the symbol in the name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge operation cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type again .
as seen in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
in identical entries the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . for folders , age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow will be yellow and later when it is old , red becomes red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the mode for syn@@ cing is active if only two folders and no explicit destination folder were specified and if the option synchron@@ ize dir@@ s . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; select the necessary action so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees only B as the visible file name ; copied directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and the option to select a new file instead of merge ( un@@ safe ) , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and hits the newer file for copying . if the files are different but the date is identical . if such errors are not fixed , the merge of the folders cannot be started .
while mer@@ ging , one file will be executed after the other . you will see the status column finished when the merge succe@@ eds , and accordingly other messages if something unexpected happened . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if the file comparison method is selected for full analysis in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display other columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the coupling actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you do not have a destination folder , then C will be used as the target in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der Mer@@ ge mode , B will be selected as the target for two folder mer@@ ging , A and / or B will be used when syn@@ cing .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that might skip certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select Start / Continu@@ e Directory Access / Continu@@ e in the Fol@@ der menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut key ) . to perform just the current entry : select Action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears that points to the faulty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box will appear with the options performing , simul@@ ating and Cancel .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
if you are finished with a file , select Rest@@ art@@ ing / Continu@@ e Directory Access / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog will appear . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; encountered a mistake , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you fix the cause of the problem . if you continue mer@@ ging ( F@@ 7 key ) , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in other way before proceeding with the merge .
if a number of entries have been merged individually , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them when they later merge . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered finished . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Set up menu Settings - &gt; K@@ AB@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignore files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the great advantage is that this folder can be set to a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hidden attribute . in other file systems , a previous point is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree or not . this option is turned on in default .
for links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
for links to folders : if the option is disabled , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ) will not check for possible recur@@ ren@@ ces . ( note that a link to a folder containing a link to itself would result in a continuous loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statisti@@ c columns . ( the number of resolved , un@@ solved , non@@ - white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and essentially slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it might be faster to compare only the modification date and file size . however , this speed advantage costs you a certain amount of security . please use caution . this option is switched off by default .
similar to confidentiality of the modification date . there is no real comparison . the files will be regarded as identical if they are equal . for example , this can be useful when copying the modification date . please use caution . this option is switched off by default .
activate the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected so that both folders are identical . also the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging the later file will be proposed as an action . ( this is considered un@@ safe because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is renamed and gets the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension is already existing , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of individual files , not only the mer@@ ging of entire folders . this option is enabled in default .
normally the folder mer@@ ging view is visible during the merge of individual files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want , you can switch off the option directory and text window in the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory and text window .
most likely you prefer to easily compare a file by double @-@ clicking . however , in the directory menu there is also a corresponding menu entry . you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder mer@@ ging . once you save the result , the status will be set to the filen@@ ame and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder merge .
however , this status is lost when you read the directory again : directory -@@ Menu : re@@ enter
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ AB@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders to open on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . you should consider a few things :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contained . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , Space &gt; &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link shows a file or folder . then a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permissions or modification dates . therefore , permissions or modification dates devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Trust of Size . ) ( This is possible only for local files . )
the main purpose is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always launches the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ AB@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In K@@ DE@@ 3 Part from the context menu .
normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is applied as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then dec@@ lines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program will start to restore the missing file .
in Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select From the Con@@ text@@ Menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ user Part . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is not reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; executed as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the play mode .
there are already tools called K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ AB@@ 2 ( now the name K@@ AB@@ 2 ) . in addition , the name K@@ AB@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the diff@@ 3 program from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to go that way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in default , configure installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will first be treated as iden@@ tically ; but if only one non @-@ white character is different , the line will not be treated as iden@@ tically . i@@ F similar lines are more often to each other , this is more often the case .
the editor notic@@ ises any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . it is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the A / B / C button . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could save this information .
the effort for this has been too big so far . you can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to edit larger quantities of text , a different editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly healed ; no sr@@ c turns ; appeared and the text cannot be extingu@@ ished . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use a different editor for this purpose .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how you can use K@@ AB@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the latest changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to compile and install ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir is the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . if you still encounter difficulties , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of them .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift ) copied to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift ) insert the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position or replace the current marker .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , after changes to these options , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function . )
this will also cause identical files to be copied to the destination folder while mer@@ ging . if the destination folder does not already contain those files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be modified in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the let@@ tering A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines will be app@@ ended from the corresponding window to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a miniature preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work surfaces , change their size , end them or move them . this works both within a desktop as well as multiple .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button window can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; motion is possible both within a desktop as well as on other work areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when you click on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only the two entries of p@@ ager ... and termin@@ ating . if however on an application inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , there will also appear the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ izing , Maxim@@ izing , On Desktop and Finish .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when clicking on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when the application has been cli@@ cked .
if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work surfaces .
when this field is enabled , the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
cross this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is enabled along with name , the names are provided with folder numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop .
if this field is enabled , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is enabled , the running programs will be shown as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty working areas will be displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple displays simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with their default icon and pixel map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classic lets &amp; p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , as known from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontally displays all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal and vertical line in a vertical line , which is very good for representation on the side on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be modified in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with their content . besides , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up a selection of switches ... the Settings dialog will pop up .
at the moment this can &apos;t be changed in the dialog box . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator .
since &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you need a working installation of the K@@ DE base pack@@ ets .

you can use &amp; k@@ mag ; enlarge a part of the screen , as if you were reading a lou@@ pe for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag ; its .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance machines .
when you start &amp; k@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the magni@@ fied area of the screen . below , this window is called a magni@@ fying window .
the area around the mouse poin@@ ter looks like a moving magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can set up a selected screen area in the magni@@ fier window ( selection window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the position of the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that the mouse cursor is currently unable to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can customize the selection box to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fier window and hold down the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fier window . this also works with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift ; button or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can shift the selection box .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection screen . note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of features . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
start or stop the display update . stopping the update causes the needed CPU time to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Low , Medium , High , Very high ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection box will be shown . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; C@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , open a new window , print , new@@ bie ( with the button again load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlarge and size , etc ; .
also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to make use of a pane of the screen , as if you would use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual han@@ dicap .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter per@@ si@@ sts on the same spot . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) Syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate the dra@@ gging with the mouse . this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helping so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , even by simply moving the mouse , pain may be caused . if you suffer from pain that is related to your computer &apos;s use , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet .
to make it clear : even though &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , helps to avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click away as soon as you stop the movement .
the smart move is enabled , power &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can drag the dra@@ gging with pressed mouse button . the intelligent shifting requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this dwell time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click navi@@ gates .
if Intel@@ li@@ gent@@ es Move is enabled , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is activated . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing down the mouse button wait , before releasing the mouse button again , if there is no moving of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking through mouse shift . if this function is enabled , a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements will be started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . to do this , go to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the General tab . there is a sli@@ der adjusting sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten response times .
when this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this function is currently only available in &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to start a program there automatically .
set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the Apply button , the settings will be reset to the stand after the last application is pressed .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the smart move should be switched off at first . if you have become accustomed to the automatic mouse click , you can later push the smart post@@ p@@ one .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; with sounds .
first you should be aware at which places a mouse @-@ click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not display a link doesn &apos;t lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again .
if your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick is that you will not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you need to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse is different from the mouse , but it should be clear when you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you &apos;d have to see the reels . these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can easily scra@@ pe the dirt and dirt with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using smart post@@ p@@ one in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer stop by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you have a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try and k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and puts the cursor somewhere else .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want it . however , you can use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to use a ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke . this way , an accidental moving of mouse clicks can cause un@@ desired reactions . secure zones for the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the toolbar and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with smart post@@ p@@ one , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the smart move is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely to mark text , copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it again or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice about it :
do not use the smart move if you just start using it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , use a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . the mouse button pus@@ hes a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the shift time starts when smart post@@ p@@ one . later , you can use the smart move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window must be installed . this should be the case on most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker and these are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressed the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter per@@ si@@ sts . this program was developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and causing pain to be afflicted .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in such a way that a drag action begins before the mouse button is released . in this way , dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging can be done with the mouse .

&amp; mouth ; is a program that allows dum@@ b users to speak to their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history that should be spoken again .
on the first page of the assistant ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the speech output of text . for more details , see the description of the Setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text passage book . from the text passages you can choose frequently used text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you define the dictionary for word tran@@ scription . &amp; K@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . additionally , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so only correctly sp@@ elled words can be added to the word processor .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth is clearly arranged and essentially contains an input field for the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a volume memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
when you have set up mouth , you can enter the sentences that you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select phrases that you want to talk again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings k@@ mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu entry ... open the settings dialog from &amp; mouth ; this dialog contains two card cards , voice output and settings , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wor@@ ds &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; page and the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the input field of the Language Output box , enter the command to enter the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , specify the character encoding which will pass the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text on . select the check box if the text is to be passed unchanged to the language generator as the default input .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
the kt@@ ts@@ d voice service is a &amp; k@@ de ; the kt@@ ts@@ d voice service is a &amp; k@@ de ; the kt@@ ts@@ d voice service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ emon , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standardized interface for voice output is available and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action following the selection of a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by keyboard short@@ cuts or by choosing a text passage in the Text Pass@@ enger Name menu or in the toolbar for text adjusting books .
with the selection of So@@ fort@@ über@@ weisung , the selected text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the loading memory . by selecting into the input field , the selected text passage will first only be entered in the input field .
the second drop @-@ down box closing the editing window for Text@@ Pass@@ enger allows you to determine whether the text passage book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
save the book with the selection of Text Pas@@ sive Book . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text passage book will not be saved . select Before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text match should be saved .
the word completion page contains a list of word @-@ related dic@@ tion@@ aries . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; mouth ; a selection field where this list contains more than one dictionary .
using the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field and in the selection box .
select the desired language for this source ; and mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply retri@@ eved by counting the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; mouth ; ask then what dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . since &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically inserts into the dictionary , you generate a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main window of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are shown as tree structure .
in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you selected a text passage , you can change the passage of text or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
add actions like new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books either by selecting the menu bar , toolbar or drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the sequence of text passages or passages by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; alt key .
the selected text will be cut and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the loading memory .
the selected text will be copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the loading memory .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding toolbar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the toolbar is located above the editing pane directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the toolbar can be moved to another location .
if this menu item is checked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar is displayed for text adjusting books with entries . by default , the bar is located above the editing pane directly under the toolbar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the toolbar can be moved to another location .
most likely you did not enter the command for the voice output properly or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the card board voice output . ( see settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer for further details . )
Festival is a language edition system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use the festival for free without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . then the command to voice output is :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ ett . the voice output is then possible with one of the following commands :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into one line . the option to send data as default input must be turned on .
the voice output da@@ emon of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the setting of the voice generator is only made in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use the possibility to use kt@@ ts@@ d as voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use it successfully , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but this depends on your computer and its configuration .
mouth ; is an application with which people who can &apos;t speak can issue text by the calcul@@ ator . a list of already spoken sentences is stored , which the user can always re @-@ write .
note that &amp; mouth ; not a speech syn@@ thesizer . on the computer , a speech syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

before you can use it , you need to install the speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher and set it right . see also
on the first launch of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card board speaker is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker installed , the card card is displayed in general . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thesi@@ zers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ops ; use since the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker .
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
when you click on the flash@@ card tra@@ cker speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card board speaker will appear . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is yet set up .
all pre @-@ set speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not require a speaker .
with a mouse click select a speaker from the list , and click this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list at a click of the mouse and click this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click select a speaker from the list , and click this button to move the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; t@@ ts ; system .
select a voting type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boy and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
when you click here , the new speaker will appear on the board . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use it . go back to the tab General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is ti@@ cked to allow the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the map files to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have at least one speaker installed , you can start the language selection system from &amp; k@@ de . click on the General tab General to open this card . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to activate the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service . this will start the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card board will be displayed , and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marker , K@@ TT@@ SD will stop and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is termin@@ ated , runs &amp; kt@@ ops ; next , if the field of speech output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the pre @-@ reading is completed .
with the buttons in this series , you can start , cancel , pause and resume text orders .
with the buttons in this series you can pre @-@ read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be applied to all pages .
the credit card orders will only be shown when K@@ TT@@ SD has been started . to launch K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the General tab and check the voice output on the map ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check the text you want to read and select the text to read in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should start .
it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; he@@ aders and other invisible stamps will also be read .
in &amp; k@@ ate ; the extended text editor from &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . first check if the text is to be read . then select the text you want to read and select the Text text from the main menu . then the voice output should start .
this also works if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ No@@ tify is the news system from &amp; k@@ de ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; noti@@ fies you about the events you have set . you can also read the text from &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . you can set up &amp; conversation ; for example , to be notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel when your nick@@ name appears . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
a menu entry will appear in the Settings menu in the Settings menu of this program . depending on the application , the No@@ tify option differs depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; belongs , is a good example . it removes tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since it can be assumed in most cases as presum@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in filters , text is edited before being sent to the speech @-@ talk program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation to replace wrong@@ ly spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain f@@ laws of voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their voices .
to understand how filters work , it is important to know how the &quot; speech @-@ pat@@ cher &quot; program works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; distinguishes four types of texts .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other applications and stops these jobs . if the output of the screen readers is read , the retained orders will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after issuing the warning .
News have the next highest priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; read a long text on a web page , you can welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also messages . read more .
the rest are simple text orders . each order that you send from the box is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any special ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queue , except for the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ t ; just one such read , this issue will be stopped and termin@@ ated .
first , you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal al@@ erts , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently , there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can still be further types of filters .
string replaced parts replace parts of a text by other text . you can specify the parts to be replaced either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is supplied with predefined string plac@@ eable filters , which enable the replacement of chat @-@ emo@@ ti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for re @-@ format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better comprehensible form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . within the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ S@@ LT files for the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ML .
with Spe@@ aker selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; send to a speaker . for example , if you have a female voice on the speaker map speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules to which it is applied to a speech output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , it continues the text to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ No@@ tification is sent to &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is processed by all activated filters arranged on the bottom of the page . processing by the filters is carried out in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are turned down from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the following setup di@@ alogs are displayed below .
for setting up string translation filters you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text will be exchanged for the associated substitute text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it must only be distinguished from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is executed from top to bottom in the order shown .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file that app@@ ends the entries from the file to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is applied only if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ trl ; button at the mouse click .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID of running programs is available with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example , &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application id copy @-@ 34@@ 32 shows , you are only allowed to type in .
the string replace filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if they agree . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string replace filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. so the words must be limited on both sides by del@@ im@@ iters .
in this manual , you will find no guide to write regular expressions . but if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ x .
XML ; Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ S@@ LT files from a format to a different format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is available via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the Spe@@ aker selection filter you can send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card board speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that texts should be read by k@@ mail from a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; pass a text to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected on the basis of the speaker properties , which dict@@ ates the program , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the characteristics of the speakers created on the card board . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ ride the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . if it is installed on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can enter it by clicking on the button to get help in entering .
to achieve faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text ful@@ fills the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected to best meet the desired requirements . click the button on the right to display the Spe@@ aking Sel@@ ection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your voice settings or delete all settings .
the Spe@@ aker selection filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .

none of the mentioned speech syn@@ thesi@@ zers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my speech ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Converter filter , but when using the module for festival sites , websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able works at all . you must do that even if you do not use this voice for reading websites . also make sure that the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is installed and located above the PAT@@ H environment variable .
certain signs or punc@@ tu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only Kau@@ b @-@ W@@ ish is spent . what can I do about it ?
first make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string replace filter . see .

the voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license , which you can find in the related documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the set @-@ down with &amp; kt@@ it ; from this , download it . you can also find the source code of k@@ not accessibility at ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page htt@@ p : / / espe@@ ak@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ d .
K@@ T@@ TS works with any speech syn@@ thesizer that can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . look also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , after information that is not yet included in this manual .
the &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers . if you want to expand &amp; t@@ ts ; for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile and des@@ kt@@ t ; you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the c@@ deli@@ bs packages and the development files for the &quot; speech @-@ pat@@ cher &quot; program .
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts , or downloaded from the source code archive or downloaded the tar@@ ball that is currently created every night , install and install the program with the following commands :
before using your speech syn@@ thesizer , check first if speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is working properly with your speech syn@@ thesizer . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of speech . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr@@ is to be developed so that the setup of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is possible directly and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is divided into individual sentences . the user can return pro@@ posi@@ tional or paragraph style , repeat , pause or cancel the output .
if an application passes text on &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output . for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female , it will be used , otherwise the best matching speaker is selected automatically . if you want to learn more about how to select a speaker , look in .
when you click Add to add a speaker to the list or click Edit in order to insert a speaker into the list or click Edit , the box Map Setup will be displayed . as an example , the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . details on the modules can be found under .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PAT@@ H , you just have to enter the festival .
select the encoding for text that is passed to the festival . in the case of voices that are comm@@ uted to the festival , this setting is done automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some controls and show this gray , the voice you selected does not allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices like multi @-@ sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first set is syn@@ thesi@@ zed more quickly ( with greater memory consumption ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to click Apply ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be displayed at the start of the program window . otherwise , only the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr can be seen in the system section after the start , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t run yet , it will appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this gives you the option to stop reading or otherwise control it .
here all orders are listed in queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently processed proposition . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column on the card board speaker .
with the buttons in this row , you can proceed or return in the list on the order selected in the list below . ( but not every job consists of several sets ) .
with a click on the OK button , all settings of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
here only text orders are listed and managed . output of screen readers , warnings and messages will not be displayed . for more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts , please refer to .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ it ; either compiled or st@@ atically compiled without support for the corresponding audio module ; cannot load the necessary libraries .
if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the talk speed here . 50@@ 5 ; % equals about half and 200@@ x@@ ; % about double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to take the new settings for the running &amp; t@@ ts ; -@@ system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you .
on this map , you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other applications and stops these jobs . after the output of the screen readers has been read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; mouth ; is an example of an application that sends messages . if you read &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless greet someone who just enters the room .
a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , al@@ erts and the output of screen readers , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a higher priority message .
to be able to read K@@ No@@ tify messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click al@@ erts . the map noti@@ fications appear .
select this check box to disable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ops ; do not read al@@ erts .
when this setting is selected , al@@ erts when a sound is played are deleted from &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog will appear where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone is mentioned in an I@@ RC message your nick@@ name .
all events for which nothing else is specified in the list are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use this sel@@ ector to specify what and kt@@ it should do ; when an event occurs , you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the properties of the speaker you want . the standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed as the top entry in the list on the Map tab . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application , the action will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . as a final option , the action will be used which has been specified by default ( all other events ) .
the All noti@@ fications for the default application ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this purpose , you can set the noti@@ fications to be submitted as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the al@@ erts into a file . use the Load button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard contains marks for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also , brands for controlling the pron@@ unciation of for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently it supports and kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the standard voice , the festival uses in the issue of SS@@ ML .
if the speed or key settings in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 % , the SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide the text into single phrases . this way , you can start or stop the first set more quickly , since only the first set does not have to be syn@@ thesi@@ zed , even if the speech syn@@ thesizer does not support this directly .
here you see the set limits recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; t@@ ts , a set limits recognition filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add more pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filters , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged from it .
the easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker selection by trying out . switch on the speaker selection and enter text to read . switch on the box selection , change some features and check how the speaker selection changes . of course , you need to have more than one speaker installed , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then start faster with the reading , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can pause or ab@@ ort text orders on the card board , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set @-@ level detection filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing .
pro@@ posi@@ tional Identi@@ fication Fil@@ ters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional phrases and insert a tab character ( decim@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tabs are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the default set @-@ level detection filter retains the punc@@ tu@@ ation .
S@@ BD filters will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , al@@ erts , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal sentence filtering filter from default , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
on the card box choice you can over@@ ride the speaker settings for the application . the card box will be displayed when
use of the default speaker ( the top one on the card reader ) . in other words : no speaker features are specified .
use of the most appropriate speaker with all characteristics of an equipped speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ t ; select this speaker . otherwise , select the speaker that matches the originally set properties .
select the method to enter desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the speaker you want . if this property does not play a part , do not give anything .
select this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set multiple markers here .
since language is a critical factor in the output of output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is before , if you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than that posted in the working environment .
to delete all the properties in the range of speakers that corresponds best to the following , click on the Standard Spe@@ aker button and then click on the speaker that best meets the following .
in this case 0 stands for the last word order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( no order number is required to enter 0 ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get back tracking .
G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed . you can try to update or uninstall any Stre@@ amer .
the audio output over AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . when I receive a text order , it freezes &amp; kt@@ ops ; one . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message stating : un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
on your system , there is a problem that conflicts occur with AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions please visit the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I loaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t show this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / vocal / vocal . as a guide , you can use the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the URL ; on which you have found the voice , to the developers .
on the Audio Card Audio there is a setting speed . for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able by the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thesi@@ zers such as Festival Interactive also offer a setting for speed on the card for speaking device . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for speaking speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) En@@ able either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are very bold , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML conversion filter , and set up the talk speed .
I don &apos;t make it possible for websites to be read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival or@@ ator , but &amp; kt@@ ams ; read the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 , the Tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that festival does not produce errors , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER tags for converting SS@@ ML . the same goes for the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a own string repair filter and now I can proceed in &amp; kt@@ t ; no more set @-@ up or return . on the tab . orders will be displayed , the job consists only of one sentence . what do I do wrong ?
you must not filter punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , ex@@ clamation point , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead use a filter for the punc@@ tu@@ ality detection .

some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts during the audio output . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ it ; freezes if you hold a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ t , the current set is still read .
the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the talk speed , but is otherwise not necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs already .

before using the syn@@ thesizer , first check if your voice syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesi@@ zers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported .
you must install at least one language . help is provided in the instructions provided with Festival . if you want to read websites , you must install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in the festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter the voice MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore search the festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; Syn@@ thesizer . then , Festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generated from it the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from

the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any speech syn@@ thesizer , which can be controlled in a &amp; console ; on the command line .
it is best to use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device
this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; to manage network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the ranges of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user :
after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Set@@ ting in &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to enable &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the device at all shows and allows setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed and set up while installing &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the option Network Set@@ ting is selected at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index . when starting the module network settings , this attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be identified , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which best meets the distribution and release status . by marking the setting non @-@ re @-@ questions , the definition can be made permanently . at the next start of the network settings then this selection will be set automatically .
changing the network settings is possible only in system management mode . previously , all options are shown in grey , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . enter the system management mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tabs :
the Network interfaces tab is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the tab Network interfaces :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button of the button ... to be edited in the Device Dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to open the dialog with further options .
automatic mode sel@@ ects TCP / IP settings from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out simultaneously with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server will send all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further setting is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , can be selected .
with the option manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be done without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address input field , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the net@@ mask input field , the sub@@ net mask must be set .
if this option is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface while bo@@ oting . if initi@@ alization is un@@ desirable , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog are shown as the characteristics of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked if the desired address is already in use .
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switching off an out@@ dated network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be turned on or off depending on the need . turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and de@@ activating the interface .
specifies the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net that communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain extension by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine is calling htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS records this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution calcul@@ ator allows for easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be re@@ arranged by selecting an entry or down@@ gra@@ ding or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with buttons Hin@@ auf or Her@@ on in priority .
by clicking on the Add button ... from the Batch Calcul@@ ator group to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . the Add Name Server dialog will be displayed .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select one entry and then click the Edit ... button is displayed in the Edit dialog .
the list of names known by name describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the list includes some well @-@ known hosts some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv@@ 6 addresses support . this version of IP still in the test will replace version 4 in future .
enter the IP address of the familiar computer and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the well @-@ known host and click the Add button . if the known host has several alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a particular known machine from the list and select Edit .... The dialog Def@@ ault Calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the Network Settings module are not effective immediately in the system . to enable the changes , you need to set the following command in a &amp; Con@@ sole .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphical interface like k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended to experienced users only . however , it is not difficult to compile your net@@ work@@ .@@ conf . the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information is given about basic network technology , in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; modi@@ fiable configuration files are discussed .
this area cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this attachment , only basic information about the integration of the PC is medi@@ ated into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 6 has never found widespread use . IPv@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future , which is why this description is currently concentr@@ ating on the widespread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing the IP address of a network interface . in other networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace the network administrator is the contact point , which is a valid IP address or , if available , can be used DH@@ CP . in any case , the IP address cannot be simply chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a particular area reserved specifically for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 machines .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . the default route is required for the IP forwarding .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to a so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .

it appears the standard k@@ de ; printing dialog . if you choose to fold out , you will see there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the printing dialog .
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have advanced permissions .
cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the time schedules of the users .
a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which additionally offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packing .
before a tape can be used , it must be mounted by &amp; k@@ dat . this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; P@@ ut the tape back and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t recognize the pre @-@ tension@@ er on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ cursor , searches it for the right index on your disk . if this cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index should be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the icon will change for the tape drive to indicate that the tape was mounted . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched for the tape by folding the entry .
before throwing the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; indicates through a change of the symbol to the band that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be ki@@ cked out without danger .
before a band can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a tape type must be format@@ ted before you can use it for saving data . this procedure does not conform to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; this procedure does not conform to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat . if your tape drive requires that a tape can be format@@ ted before use , it must be format@@ ted before using the tape from &amp; k@@ dat . floppy disks usually do not require format@@ ting the tape , DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and the capac@@ it@@ ance drives &amp; k@@ dat , proceed with the format of the tape . all data on the tape are lost ! after completing the format@@ ting process the tape is automatically included and is ready for use .
before you start the backup process , you must select the files you want to backup , which can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only backup this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a check box . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save In the Save ...
once the backup has been initiated , the Settings dialog opens . in this dialog you can again check the selected files and change the backup settings .
if you have confirmed the settings , the Backup dialog will appear . the dialog will show the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the time remaining .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder is checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a check box . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select In@@ sert menu item ....
once the test process has been started , the dialog will appear for checking . in this dialog you can check your selection once more and change the working folder for verification .
if you have confirmed the verification settings , the dialog pop@@ s up . this dialog displays the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
before re@@ building , the files to be recovered must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive entry . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a check box . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ...
once the restore process has been started , the Pre@@ ferences dialog will appear . in this dialog you can check your selection once more and change the restore job folder .
once you have confirmed the restore settings dialog , the Rest@@ ore dialog will appear . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file using the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the currently selected working folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files located therein will be backed up on the same file system as the folder . folders that lie on other file systems can be placed separately under backup files . each entry is viewed from tar regardless of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file from tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the K@@ nu@@ ck@@ les files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; files were not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape device .
this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; dat ; before the tape is involved , the command mt load is loaded onto the drive . on some drives this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , you try to lock the tape . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , when mounting &amp; k@@ dat , the band will be ki@@ cked off automatically . do not use this option for Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is turned on , you will try to change the hardware block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must notify &amp; dat ; in any case you need to tell the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat , a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where the name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time the tape has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup band . this icon is only active when a tape is mounted .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files . moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access , for example , on information about problems appearing on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system bases the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log enables experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , try to provide some advanced features which can be filtered and evaluated using the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shots , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the main protocol file of the system - the system log - will open . if this is not shown to you , and it opens up instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most likely do not start with system administrator privileges . the protocol files usually do not have permission to read under Linux in the / var / log folder for normal users .
you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criteria or character strings . the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically so that only log lines will be displayed to fit the selected filter . in the default setting , the selection field contains the All . then , a record line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included .
of course , you can also select another entry . for example , in the log file system log , select the process column , and in addition , in the log file system log , select the process name , and write in the fil@@ ter@@ strip the name of a process , so it will show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all log lines sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the stage errors are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color as the protocol lines of the level critic . the colored representation of protocol lines can be turned off setup dialog .
if you want to show only certain processes ( e.g. in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can check the Add to new lines button in the main window context menu to display all new log lines added .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to display multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own web page on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. There you can find further information about the supply sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archives : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and named in the following as well ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
system V In@@ it is rapidly becoming standard for the control of the program start when starting the system in the &amp; Linux ; this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re @-@ format@@ ting . the Linux kernel looks first under / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you must make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there , if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs also from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for each system service that you want to start when you run the system or switch to another round level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file even if you don &apos;t have much use for it . you can also get a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to execute something with the serial port .
the kernel looks in@@ it at different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one that it finds .
the default runtime is in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see in the initial area a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably state that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up , then you can fix it by rest@@ art@@ ing the system and doing the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written so that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line like this :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server run level that runs only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; in addition , I could also have a user @-@ run level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; using a mouse or other pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : just drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six runtime levels to launch it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ modes or modify the position within a level by dra@@ gging it somewhere else . the entry will be removed from its original runtime ( or its position ) . this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the field of dispos@@ able system services .
note : entries are moved if you drag them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new level , you must explicitly choose Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry existed previously in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : there is currently no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the Tab key to activate the different work ranges ( Available System Services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry to another round level , move it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and paste it into the desired runtime with insert ( using C@@ trl ; V ) .
to manually change the sorting number or the name of an entry , press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of loss of data , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . def@@ aults are retri@@ eved from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard runtime levels , and now the machine is constantly running . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt line lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default runtime to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; running under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services can be started in these distri@@ butions simplifies the configuration of the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to a standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check that all configuration files are available that are needed by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply end without a message if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly arranged .
the Import@@ ance of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the runtime to be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter custom@@ ization of &amp; k@@ user .
after you have made changes , you need to save them . you can either use the corresponding toolbar icon or the Save In the File menu .
the main window consists of two card cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . the dialog appears for the user / group properties dialog .
some cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings . other cards may appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD @-@ Unix .
the card password management board appears if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD @-@ Unix .
this card box only appears if there is at least one built @-@ in fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quot@@ a ) activated and initi@@ alized ( identi@@ fiable at the file quot@@ a user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with the space limitations provided in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the File System field with space limitation .
the management board groups inform about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary group . furthermore , the user can become a member of other groups by marking them in the large field .
the Properties dialog box contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group will work an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO System Manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot from the default operating system , add the default operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more .
