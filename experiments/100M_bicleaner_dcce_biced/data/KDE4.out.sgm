<seg id="1">The module website can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras Website. select the starting and target language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated at the location of the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, translations don't make important decisions, without checking the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages can be translated. other texts should be translated into the Babelfish website itself, where you can insert texts to be translated.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains different modules for & konqueror;. despite their small size, they offer some extra features and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by making them available easier.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the Guide to & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Setting Extensions.... Check the Tools tab and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard Settings modules from the box kde; addons. please note that possibly more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on the & konqueror; on extras crashes. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; to crash, or the list of crashes, if present.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module Angle Filter (also called Ordinary Filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; Menu bar under Extras address filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use DOM tree view in & konqueror; select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with DOM of the currently displayed page. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: documentItem, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides an additional view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory with local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different toolbar and text views to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The feature of & FSView; consists of graphically represented nested order hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree-Map. each object is represented by a rectangle whose area is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the size of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView, the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily detected even if it is far below in the folder hierarchy. consequently, & FSView may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView, an entry in the Treemap is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your file system. for easier navigation, the rectangles possess meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can either display depth for easy recognition of the nesting depth or image of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify if it is displayed at all, only if there is enough room for representation or whether the area of subordinate rectangles is to be used (whereby therefore display errors may occur due to constraints on the mark of the Treemap). furthermore, you can set the relative position of the label in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">With Treemap in & FSView, it should be observed that the area is proportionally related to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always observed. frames need space, which is no longer available to subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">The implementation of the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. in this case, it is always advantageous for the labeling and avoidance of space losses by frame to create rectangles that are as square as possible. the best methods in this respect are rows, columns or recursive division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimum displayed area for an entry via the menu entry View View on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally was & FSView; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap Widgets developed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Image Gallery module can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras picture gallery... or by Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the Picture Gallery module, a dialog opens, allowing you to specify the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The option title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The images per line option has a slider and a rotational field to set the number of thumbnails of each line in the gallery.</seg>

<seg id="32">To include the subfolder check box, you can set up with a slider or a script to which level the subfolders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">With the check box to copy original images, specify whether the original images should be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">The check box in the comment file allows you to specify a comment file for caption of images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box own color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Module & HTML; Settings provides easy access to general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The Module & HTML; Settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">You can find the media playback for the navigation pane in the & konqueror; Display menu under Windows Navigation Pane or using the F9 keyboard shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the & konqueror's navigation pane and drag the music files you want to listen to the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser identifier adds a menu entry in & konqueror; in addition, with which you can change browser and operating system identifiers for individual domains. this is helpful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser identifier of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser, change the browser identifier into one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the password in MSIE for pages that reject access to browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need MSIE browser recognition to access the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identifier of this outdated browser.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into digital cameras. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, every medium and every card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digitizing; working together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digitized; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, rate and correct your photos. editing capabilities can easily be expanded with KDE Image Plugins Configuration interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digitized; easy to use, dozens of professional capabilities are available. it works complete in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; over the camera or lens to be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also & digitized; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. you should therefore report any problems and opportunities for improvement.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digitized; try to report any problems or suggestions for them as easily as possible. wherever you are in the program, the help menu contains an entry problems or wishes.... This opens a dialog with a underlined linkage. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system. all required information is already registered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that means, the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we encourage you to answer questions to other users of & digikam; ask and hopefully soon even answer questions of other users. in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digikam; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to join & digiplug; to participate, registration is in the developer mailing list. instruction to report in the developer mailing list by & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & Edit; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database. you can enter here a local, remote or removable folder. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you will need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data is saved. this path will be the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you would like to add. & Edit; will additionally be used as an Albenbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains images as the base folder. & Edit; looks at each subfolder as an album. no image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& Edit; Endures recursively the library path in its full depth. you can't close any subfolders unless it iste in hidden folder. this can be done by setting a point before the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Altilist do not have any photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put this on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, it can be edited and digitized; possibly also bypassing it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported Rohcameras in the Help menu support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the section Roh-Decoder Options and Roh workflows.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into digital cameras. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, every medium and every card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digitizing; working together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digikam; uses the program gPhoto2 to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras supporting an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos generally are large files and transfers over the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digitized; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images using gPhoto2. see this link for a complete list of supported cameras.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support so that the thumbnails of digiKam can be read reliably. the Exif support is needed by some libgphoto2 camera operators to read the thumbnails. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may not be able to see preview images or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the nicest things to digitize is how easy it is to extend its functionality through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE image plugin interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digitizing;, KPhotos Album, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphic programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digitized; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes came in & digitised; self-made.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode using F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop images works everywhere: you can place an image in another part of the tree, using the horizontal divider line or in another application window. the only restriction is that you can't put a picture in keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to choose the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. so the filter functions on the filename only if it is displayed in the symbol view. which fields are displayed you can configure in the dialog of the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos edited by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders where they were stored on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the Albenistics tab or after the date on which the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. just select Import Photos to record album. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the destination album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. you can also move or copy several photos in the same way. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection. to access the album properties, right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album- Collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can group under a common name. the collection you use will be used to sort your photos, if you want to select Home collection from the toolbar or view albums After the collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums By date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The Elder, Average, New Year's buttons: these set the date to the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. this first attempts to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file in this folder is used instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first have an album in & digikam, the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this should help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, you have to click the image with the right mouse button and in the context menu & quot; When album preview appenquot; select. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be contained in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digiplug; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list at the bottom left of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images will be displayed in this album in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of these thumbnails with the two loupe buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When opening an album for the first time, you need to wait a bit while the preview images are generated. you can avoid this by using the Tools Show all thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image will be displayed below the associated preview. what information is, you can edit and customize settings. select the Albums tab here and customize the preview images to suit your needs.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear, when you let the mouse pointer rest a moment over a picture. the help shows the most important features including all keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the section Introduction to the main window displays such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all about it & digikam; works. albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. the image processing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these. you can view all the features that came with & digitizing; you can choose between viewing images, slide show or editing images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by right-clicking on F4 Image... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and selecting Edit.... in the Edit menu, you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & Edit; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by right-clicking the context menu and selecting the program from the File Type submenu. to do this, and how to customize it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image editing programs, there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& Edit; provides two options for rotation. the simplest one is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select Rotate. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right click on the preview and select F2 rename from the context menu. note that you will retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you have a photo taken from & Edit; Delete, it is moved to the trash bin of & kde; moved. F8 Image Delete or Del if you rather want to delete it, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The View & quot; My Datumelistequot; organizes your photos according to the data. & Edit; uses either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month are displayed in the image view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date screen so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a cue is assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search again.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to logically organize your keywords. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keyworlistequot; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and allocated key word in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. you can also use your tags in other programs as well. in addition, the keywords are re-imported when the database is lost, as soon as & digitized; the pictures are noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either on & quot; My keyword quot; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this will be the substitch of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by right-clicking on the keyword and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and leaving there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to shift the keyword. a keyword can be only once in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by right-clicking it and selecting keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree & quot; My keywords.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, you have to click the image with the right mouse button and select as the album title in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To make use of the functionality with keywords, you first need to add keywords. this can be done in two ways: once you select the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keywords. alternatively, you can also right-click on the thumbnails of the images and select keyword alphabetically from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can select a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the key words assigned to him. in this way you can give a cue for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, this is displayed under the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can right-click the context menu of the photos and select Remove from the Tags menu. the menu only shows the keywords that have been assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view displays a time-dependent readability histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection box can be moved over this histogram. to select a time frame, you just have to click on the bottom rectangle of the selection frame indicating the time unit. this will display all the associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. this will then appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Next to the search box is a small lamp the green is displayed when the search finds matches. if you click here, the filter will be deleted and all images are displayed again. if the search has found nothing, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this you will see a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search that always filters what you entered as search criteria. after you have saved it, it appears filter in the list.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press OK and the search will be executed. the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window. the Text box Save search is used to assign your request a name to my search list. if you want to change your selection after searching again, you just need to select the corresponding entry from the My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">When you select Search Edit, the search form will appear again with the previously entered search information. if you select Expanded Search, the Advanced Search dialog appears to change your previous search. you will find more information in the Advanced Search tool section.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete Search in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">Advanced Search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the AlbenDatabase. all rules are displayed time-wise, separated by operators. an option can be added to this list using the logical operations All..., One..., No..., No... or At least... You can search for Type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digitized; characterized every picture by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this makes it possible to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two signatures, the more they correspond to each other. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop any image to find a similar one. by using a sponge, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand-drawn sketch: draw a quick sketch and toast; finds the matching pics. here too, a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it. move it while you press the left mouse button. press Ctrl; left mouse button to draw a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo-filter. this will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a Live Geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digitized; provides a lamp table in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Add the lamp table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the lamp table and its window opened. if you are back in & digitised; main window, you can quickly open the lamp table with L Extras illuminated table.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right corner of the window. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you select Preview from the toolbar and perform a zoo or move operations on one of the pictures, then you will compare the same area of the two images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of pictures. if you navigate pairing mode from the toolbar, the first two images will be automatically loaded into the areas to compare. use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to view it in the right pane. this simplifies working through a series of similar pictures.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal soldering actions work directly from the light table like e.g. F4 file processing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the illuminated table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows. to pivot the visible range of the image, you have to click it and press the & LMB; hold down. in Mode Preview both images will display the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zoom works just like in other views. just use the zoom slider under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this is done in both pictures if you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital inventory management - away from the fashion? digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been made until final output and permanent storage. each of the photos absorbs, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips how to back up your pictures, find, protect and use photos again. we focus on the procedures for digital photographer the & digikam; use. we review the download, rename, remove, convert, group, backup, evaluate, duplicate, archive, optimize, maintain and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management records, indexes, categorizes, secures, searches, transforms, confection and exports contents which have a monetary or cultural value quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is, according to your definition, data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you need no longer to find a specific photo. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then use not & digitite;. the approach can save metadata both in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving, which you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">First thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you have to decide if you want to have other access to your photos, whether you want to save them to a private drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure that you have to switch to a bigger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">You might be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can quickly be found about your location unless you were in a year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then export. then export a folder for images you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new ones from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and work files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know whether you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend that you save metadata in the Metadata Settings page. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently store the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding item in the Album View menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change them? set & Edit; give them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you should now assign keywords, labels and a rating to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then. this makes sense, as you can focus on the best photos when further work is done.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's talk with keywords, keywords, as you often refer to other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam; automatically set up the tree for you or insert images to the right place. converting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by moving a sub-tree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graph shows how different metadata is overlapping. this is a very crude representation as each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most people don't want to let anybody see your photos just, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start dreaming to have associations, memories, the historical time span is once again present, you may even hear the silence. so the inscription has changed your perception of this panorama completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to generate an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help him about the subject you moved has to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is alright if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & Edit, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as a label. KDE even provides you with a spell checker. if you export your images in web galleries, then these labels will be exported to your wishes in the label and / or the title of the web gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the move of the spatial presentation already drives with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to utilise geolocation are countless and will become deeper in the future. I'm sure that someday, in the near future, you can virtually replicate your travels by images with geographical indications. & digitized; can also export cml files you can open with GoogleEarth. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the Google Maps Viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all modified versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information on the setup page of & digikam; should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for producers and authors): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the photographer's name, e.g. to protect the photographer's identity, the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title: linked to the author. this field contains the photographer's work description. examples for this can be title as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others. if the image is a stock photo, then here the group / agency that offers the image here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to populate the author and copyright sections although they do not offer protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or change this image embedded in the image. for private persons, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">Digital watermark is unique in each image. & digitized; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: plate error, disk failure, current collisions, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of the storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire. these types of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it's about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery firm, has some interesting statistics, which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, they need to be treated carefully and you can no longer trust them than a couple of years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archival quality which last longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and storing them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write a lot more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if you have just written. that's why they use a checksum mechanism to protect yourself. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs, there is a convenient program called IsoBuster which apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to capture the format warfare against HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs is also true for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Slow down with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-propriate format. then read the data again to verify you. likewise, you should copy the media with a description, date & author and then copy to a clean, dark dry and protected spot. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves. their manufacturers' warranties include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives: disk error study</seg>
<seg id="187">The most common error reason, SMART, is the most common error reason, SMART cannot detect these errors. some of the errors identified by SMART show the imminent failure. this is in particular read errors and publisher counters. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the total losses due to overvoltage. of course, you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can usually be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices do not make a lot of power, it looks different from devices with computer chips and high speed processes. these can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause serious damage. protect yourself from the unavoidable loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against power spikes is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar. remember, however, that not every male connector also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection then you should make sure that it complies with the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also be careful that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system should also be protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage contactors, which also have a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a wearable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are especially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem. thus, you are ideal for on the go.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in uninterrupted power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically supply battery energy when a power failure occurs. some models allow you to save your data and run the system in order. if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the cost of avoiding these. a high-quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to 6 euro; a low price difference if you consider how well your computer is using it. at the end, you should always remember to clean all the cables before going into the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can mount it as a drive on & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offering you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">You are in comparison to the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data over the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important pictures. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are available on photos. their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures at full resolution online. for $25 per year you get unlimited storage, which should be checked in reality first.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very safe. transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory in the offer.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the calculator. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the ZFS and btrfs file system ensure at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. all of these disruptions remain undiscovered until you someday open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of data transfer losses, as they create interferences inside the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates that can deal with disk errors at low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon also be available for Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms used by ZFS and is also available for Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% on the workstation systems.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it causes less damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and Linux; no longer has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFs and XFS to name the broadest file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file has not been fully saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: false, theft, and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are located 1-2 stops of aperture from fundamental physical boundaries. it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result more deteriorated. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolution you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk drive you today for 100 & euro; so make no anyone responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are often affected by a data loss. so, backup your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous as the reinstallation of your operating system, changing disks or resizing disks.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make daily your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash hit you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget the aircraft gap: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or something like that.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as already said above, a common reason for a data loss despite back up the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Full backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Diffuser protection: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot of two times: the complete backup and the last difference security.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original state at any time on which such a backup was made. this backup comes with a version system closest to the exception that is only scanned and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that were really changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Save important pictures directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other visual media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach lets you get enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time you come up for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, IPTC stored in the image file, retain associated XMP files, retain memory, scalability, media, recover images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">In order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you need to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate while time is passing. unfortunately, there is no other possibility than to leave a certain vigilance. the less variants you used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document. do not use or change to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and fuses, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist expression for the ability to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have included the scalability with the plan and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems such as & Linux, you can copy this area and relocate it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the dmesg command if your new disk was detected by the system, but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # Source is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; disk size works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; reside / dev / sdc1 # change the size of the disk if needed</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can read it, you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG is designed as an open source standard that should replace GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can recommend gamma and chromaticity data for improved color assignments in heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF has been widely used as a picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (default). however, with some cameras you can save your images in this format. however, a problem is that this format is adapted by many people. therefore, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a license-free and open frame format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG was developed based on the TIFF / EP format and required to use meta data. a handful of camera manufacturers are already available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Image Resource block quot; technology of the 1990s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot; it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data into a file themselves. the file information is saved with the extension & quot; .xmquot; stores the XML / RDF file.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format. XMP works as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, there can be problems with the link between the metadata file and the image file and as mentioned above, the raw format is old. therefore, you should consider whether you are using DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. the activities of DCMI include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to reach a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera edium, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them to your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine-layered editing you can use external programs. if you edited the images again with & Edit, then you should add the metadata again. these were possibly truncated by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. only export them in web galleries, encoding in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digitized; see section Add a photo to an album you will be able to add a description on how to add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your AlbenDatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; connect it to the computer, turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on. you can find another description in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it attempts to connect to your camera. for some cameras it can take a while. if the connection is made, a heel indicator appears at the bottom end and thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the sidebars features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Metadata tab displays internal metadata such as Exif, Manufacturer notices, GPS etc. of the image. this information is the same as the metadata page bar from the main window of & digikam; or image editing. note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of All. this invites all photos from their camera to a single album in & digikam;. when downloading, the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can only select the desired ones using the default selection methods from & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and download Selected. the Selected button is extracted until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New Download is available. these images have not been edited by & digikam. in this case the new images are marked with an asterisk in the preview window. if you select this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you use the All Download or Selected buttons, a dialog will appear where you can select the destination album in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Albums section. then select the destination album from the list and click OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & Edit; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at one time by using the Delete All Delete button. if you just want to delete some, you have to select them first and then delete the selected ones.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera. the photos will not be moved to the garbage dump of & kde; you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded in a & digitized album before you delete them from the camera. if you want to delete the camera system completely, you should do so via the camera mount, since this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">The file names are normally recycled after the photos were deleted from the camera. this can lead to double file names, if you load photos from different recording galleries into the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for date-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created per day automatically.</seg>
<seg id="263">The first two relate the data about the author in the section Standard car identity. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information to the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you prefer a different date format than the standard format, you can use the prefix photo-% Y-% d% d:% M:% S for example in the edit field. to do so, turn on the option Date & Time. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera filename, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters when you download them. or in uppercase, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digikam; used for a photo is displayed below the name the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitized; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic turn while downloading. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is normally switched on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, it can be digitised; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the Advanced button and select the Automatic rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made, it can be used to automatically create sub albums in the target album. all images with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information. in the Meta data section you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off and digitised in this case; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn on this option. to do so, use the Advanced button and select the date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file using the Standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, & digitized; you where the images should be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select here the desired folder and press OK to start uploading. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position specified in longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the identification of the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatically recording the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was made, you can click on a browser to display the area. if you want to send a postcard to another, user who can localize the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to store the positional data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction, semitrailing and map references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the correct hardware, via a reworking of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical allocation (manual) and last via the manual entry of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Download the GPS data from one device can be done using gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to save these data in gpx format as this is the only format supported by the geographic allocation module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are several programs for Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same on & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the Exiftool by Phil Harvey. it uses the delimited co-ordinates that are generated by maps.google for example.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& Edit; tries to give you as much control over its workflows as possible. there are many settings that have the behavior of & digikam. to access these settings, you must select setting up. the settings dialog is subdivided into eight pages. you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select Action can be set to a saved preview or start image editing. you set the default behavior of & digikam; determine if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright information. these data are automatically written to the corresponding IPTC data fields if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for author's line: this field should include the photographer's professional name. this may be a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a closer description of the author, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for vendors: use this field to specify the one that the photo offers. this does not have to be the author, if it works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the appropriate IPTC field. this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the data base of & digikam; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited and edited without getting lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image captions as embedded labels (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the images. thus, your captions can also be read by other picture viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information appearing when the mouse cursor is placed in the main window above a file. depending on the option selected, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; Edit; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam, then you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. any file in one & digikam; album folders that will not have any of these extensions, by & digikam; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset by pressing the Update button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">These settings can be set to the default values on this page. however, every time you open the illuminated table these settings are switched on. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. the option & quot; In all image size ladenquot; you should only use on fast computers. if you have one then you can get better viewing results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can switch off the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture. these colors are set here. in image processing, this View Mode can be switched on and off using F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-Subsampling it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for more information.</seg>
<seg id="297">With PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality, since PNG requires a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option to compress TIFF files, you can turn on the default compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no effect on image quality, since the default algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the Loss-free JPEG 2000 files, you can save loss-free. even if you select the lossy setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is much better than at normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In earlier versions of & digikam, image editing was just a picture viewer for photos. currently, it is quickly evolving into a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard assumption is that all green pixels are the same. if the upright green pixels of the CCD sensor respond more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels with odd rows, this difference creates a lattice pattern in the output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option draws the image a bit soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard is a fixed color balance based on a white card photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed pictures get more details in four steps. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the pointed-lights, so the parts of your images that are burned-in, because of the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights as perpendicular white. use the setting colors create some unusual results as they show the pointed lights in various roses. finally, you can attempt to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast saturate as green and red. & dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When choosing the option of reconstructing, you get the possibility to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be adjusted separately for each picture.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to set it a bit higher than the default 1. this can also be done later in the frame options of the & digikam; Image editing. to keep the time for the demo icing small, you should go conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo-icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA-interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provide you with three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests, it looks like this. VNG-Interpolation (variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, it produces color artefacts on the edges. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method of color grading, since it is performed during the pipe conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the colour information and gives instructions how to return it. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information like the colour information of a color space can be translated into the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions, when an image is opened in image editing / Color management module with raw files start.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile folder Set here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC where you can save all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have here the option & quot; default squot; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed later when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your images color managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should match the camera operator and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, like e.g. Canon, which does not contain any color-mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma doesn't correct for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to change the color-mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft Proof profile, with which you can emulate how your image would be returned from one device. this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors are therefore very satiated. this could you manually correct instead of rely on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for. unfortunately, not on the models of Canon. therefore, here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is of course inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the goal: F for an exact style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by providing this interface can & digikam; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use, and these are then edited by & Edit. these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition, you will also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short instructions for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project at http: / / www.kipi-plugin.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The slide show settings should be easy to understand. the upper regulator adjusts the time between the image transitions, normally 4-5 seconds are good. the other check boxes turn the metadata into or out which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features on the left hand side a list of all currently supported cameras. on the right-hand side a button auto detection exists which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, turned on and in image display mode. below are the port settings. currently, serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / box where you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digikam, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & edit; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the main window of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog box for moving &gt; Images in the Mülbins, you can set the dialog from & Edit; when deleting a photo in an album, you can find more details in the deleting a photo and deleting an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right side bar can be silently edited by & Edit; if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without any queries, otherwise you need to save the changes with the button Changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also add the display of the welcome screen of & Edit; prevent when starting. this may hasten the start process of & digitite;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting When starting to search for new photos forces & digitizes; scan the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos. this lengthens the start time of & digikam;. if anything was deleted from the base folder, & digitised; you see if it should delete them from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be edited in & Out; used to customize the main window to suit your taste. these settings can be selected from the toolbar settings. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam, you will find more information about it in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& Edit; includes fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the thumbnail preview and selecting the item Display / Edit button.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam; so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules, please refer to Setting up the Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and among them the toolbar for quick access to most required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image editing change your photos. none of the functions will however change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you might want to make a copy of your image before you change it. you can save this with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by recreating from the File menu or using the Recover button Restore the image editing in the toolbar. you then lose any change you've done on the photo since last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually every action of image editing can be reversed or restored. the last action you can undo by selecting Edit / Restore, by selecting Edit Recover from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should take the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and remember Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you select the & LMB; press the Recover or Restore button on the toolbar for a moment, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by moving the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, picture down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can zoom in and out in the photo by using Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button on the toolbar: automatically choose the magnifying factor</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you come to the normal view where you use the Edit button. if you do not want this, you can edit this in the dialog from & Edit. you can view this from the Edit Pane dialog. see the section for setting up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select the image from the File menu and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or entire sentences. entire image preview pages can be printed from your selection. you just need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Album Export Print Assist. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digiplug; main window has a sidebar on the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is also available in image editing without the navigation file. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear again.</seg>
<seg id="355">You can enter or paste labels with unlimited size in the label view. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the labels are copied to the EXIF- and IPTC fields so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted. if you want to use the IPTC label field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on it, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, the labels will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Next to the application button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a valuation scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and sorting. it can be used either with a single click of the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select them and use the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written to the urgency IPTC field. the code follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used before in this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the input keyword, so you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful if you have a lot of keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further simplification in the input of keywords in a series of images. if you have entered different keywords, they are saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword in the IPTC field.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection, if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please refer to the keyword Filters section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The Keyword keyword filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. usually, the left side bar is used with their Album, - Date, keyword and search views. if additional one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two will be displayed. all generated keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop tags. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and put it on the selection. then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the top example, the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is based on no words, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected with Ctrl + a, and then a keyword has been drawn from the right-hand-tree to the selection and stored there. a dialogue asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be switched off under Settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and state that it should be one or its, you can easily change it by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the record searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already placed in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an Advanced Search on all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the grouping button. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why weren't Picasaweb respectively Flickr listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I did it mainly to & digikam; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that the colors that you print or publish on the web that are from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the topic comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons it has to press for the results they want. unfortunately, color management means that you have informed decisions at each point of image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide links with deeper information allowing you to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your picture workflow fulfils all six criteria listed below, you do not need to worry about color administration.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor calibrated to the sRGB color space. (for more information see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image issues are per email or Web where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if so sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should one use another color space and thus have to worry about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all the colors we can see, the horseshoe region, and the colors in the sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to calliate my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in the sRGB color space or not, you need to sound your monitor as sRGB is based on sRGB so that your; onitor closes the circle. if you work as a color space of sRGB, you either need to callibricate your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve one image in most cases. therefore, use it before trying any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, offset, automatic adjustment and contrast extend from the menu Correcting Automatic correction try automatically from your colors to make the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the leukscrew values over the entire image, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Similar: this method adjusts the brightness value factor of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. thus nearly every brightness area has the same number of pixels. sometimes, the comparison achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Enlarge contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the highest possible range and a re-jib of all values in between. this is only visible with balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly limited since a colour space with 8-bit per color is worked. so if you can move too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu entry Colors White Balance of Image Processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview will dynamically customize the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target picture has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right up, a histogram is shown that changes dynamically as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve or dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play with the above controls, use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The Overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel is overexposed. you will see the combined result displayed in white balance. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons make exactly this. any setting of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button returns all filter values to their default values and neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in another picture than your original. if you save these settings, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality images. however, this coding needs more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color-mapping can be done through the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu under colors sound correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to use them for more photos. this is useful when your camera or your scanner always make the same mistake and you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure issues is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">Die & digikam; tool colour effects provide you with four colour effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canister filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that emerged when you replaced a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photo paper from the additional light. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls solar arisation. at about 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further upliftment finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar energy efficiency. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simply, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a colour film that is optimized for daylight by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia's strongly saturated colours are too much for some photographers, especially those who have hardly any landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sliders reps the strength of the neon light. for large images, the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and luminous intensity of the photos. you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the reverse problem: one too big saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous thickness / contrast / gamma the tool is set to improve exposure. even if the dialog with this tool works very complicated, you only need the area of the slider for the application intended here. concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected range. under the graph, three sliders are clicked into and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate is to shift the controller and take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be updated dynamically, using the settings of the image. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box can be used to determine whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic y-axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear representation is often the most useful. in images, the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controllers: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinpoints can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, middle and bright tones. furthermore, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers which can be used to change the output values as interactively as with the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a blank image as background while something else in the foreground is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and Load: using these buttons, the set values can be saved in the filesystem and loaded later. for that purpose, the Gimp Levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipette, the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of adjusting entry values to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and Alpha Channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">The left side shows half of the original and the target image. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. the following options are available on the right:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that changes from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most useful. for images with large areas of a constant color, linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode continues.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you shift a curve to the right, e.g. the bright tones, you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output stages and that the corresponding pixel pixels get darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos, a red marker is to be seen. if you want to change this mark to the area you want to change, a suitable line will be displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and Load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three color pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, medium and sun tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if overexposed pixels are found in more than one channel, you get the combined result displayed. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of & digikam; image processing is a tool to improve color channels or change color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The Channel Mixer is another advanced tool to mix the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by looking at relative distribution and rash. the left part of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed as compared to your own tab.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position this in the image a vertical line in the histogram will appear to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are below: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you enable Luminance, the picture will retain the general brightness as well. if you activate luminance, this is particularly convenient if you also activate the option Monochrome, since the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space. color-space consists of small noise artefacts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose pattern patterns in each channel look different. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color of the color first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and load buttons are used for this purpose. any mixer setup allows you to save and load for later. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the Blue channel has been readjusted. the Luminance option is activated. the original image is available under (1) and the processed image under (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of its abstract capability. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, since color images can be easily converted on the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford DELF Plus, Ilford BJP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene pictures and fits particularly well with portraits of the sky.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate lunar scenes at daylight times. so similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Squiaton: creates warm, bright and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of bleaching a pressure and redevelopment in a sampatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) sampafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & digikam, tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and the modified under (2) to see. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digitool; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the scattering eye. under picture frameworks the module can be started from image editing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, set the desired frame type for your image. throughout, the image borders with a colored line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), bordered it with a nice three-dimensional frame that is ideal for a buttoneffect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the range for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be greater than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have previously used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture anywhere. this can also be done at several locations if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type the text and place it with the mouse. use text execution, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." after the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digikam; tool templates you can put a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image Template menu can be applied in image editing can be used to create templates on an image.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions on size and orientation. however, you need to use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your stencil of & digikam, send an email in English to the & digikam; mailing list digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to put your stencil folder with the base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the stencil files. these settings are scheduled for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the stencil folder. selecting a folder automatically updates the thumbnail of the templates automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button decreases the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole image, you need to zoom in accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the picture below the template. to do so, take the picture and place it in the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be automatically adapted to thumbnail size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digitized; provides three different sharpening tools. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional sharpening tool. it is very fast and simple, but generates grainy pictures especially in dark areas.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurring mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. in fact it sharpens no bit, it works rather psychoacoustically. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digital images require a correction of sharpness. this is due to the fact that the digitization process must combine colors with only minimal differences to a color point. this in turn causes sharp edges to be printed together. SLR cameras typically need more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">Images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners already turn a sharpening filter while reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with sharpening work. you can use the menu entry Correcer sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="487">They should be careful, however, as the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also increases the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image refocus the tool. you can refocus more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the image a little softly is much easier than sharpen it. use the soft sign tool with the Conducer softness and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Filter Unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove slipper from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview will help you to edit the image. the preview window will display the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount amplifies the effect. if you make the blurring mask too strong, rustling and the impression of grats will produce close to sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore sharpen images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image that is added to the original. this will set the strength of the focus.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applied difference amount. thus, you can define a minimum difference with it for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft alternation between the tones are excluded from sharper and therefore beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image the (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocus a picture by improving sharpness. it used the copyrighted removal filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is using a blurring mask. refocus mostly reaches better results than blurred mask. you can start it from the menu by refocusing on colors in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß 'fold. the Gauß'sche folding has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixles that are far from the original quellpixel. in most cases, the FIR Vienna Inverse of the Gauß' Fitting is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular hotness: this is the radius of the circular fission. it is the most important parameter to use this module. for most images, the default value should result in 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very blurred then pay attention to halo notes.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise Filters: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. the filter can accept values of 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad. a usable value is 0.03. a high value will further mitigate the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's focus: this is the radius for the palate. use this parameter if your blurring is Gauß '. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 in order to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value nonzero then you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size of the die can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular hotness or the gauss's edge. note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load buttons are used for this purpose. any refocused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to correct all the cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress pictures, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, Unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by blurring masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, impartial masking must always produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions, it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Vienna filter one can show that it is the optimal linear filter. the result of the FIR Vienna filter is always at least as good as the blurring mask. the FIR Vienna filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of focussing in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">"" "the regulator" "" "Glätte" "" "sets the blurring of the area darkened in order to create a more natural pupil." ""</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various pre-settings as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available pre-settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to fine adjust the filter settings, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothness above the picture. whereas larger values tend to smooth homogenous regions and detail. a value of 0.9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpening is needed afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 is only smoothed in one direction. if you have a movie granulator or CCD noise, a high value will produce wavy pattern. JPEG Artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing rate over allel. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, put this value corresponding to the degree of smoking in your picture.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbula effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: specifies how often the algorithm is going to go through. usually this is enough for 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle Exposure da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is small, it should also be chosen small. make sure that small angles generate a long term. therefore, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never taller than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Using linear interpolation: the more the quality you receive by selecting this option is low, but it doubles the running time. we therefore recommend it to leave it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load Buttons do exactly this. correct any setting of pixel errors can be saved into a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting errors is comparatively fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small artefacts. the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a strange black Artefact in the foreground that caused by a bad movie shift during the trip. the original image is available under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">Die & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, only the subwindow details and the subwindow Advanced Settings can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is needed per pixel and can wipe the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller errors.</seg>
<seg id="536">Focus: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to detect luminance changes. if it is increased, noise spikes will be removed. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise can be removed or noise spikes can occur. set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change color or luminance to improve one image. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change color or luminance to improve one image. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamemance tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically smoked more strongly. however, it also lubricates the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Attenuation: controls the adjustment of the phase jitter damping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter range reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is increased, smokers and phase jitter appear at the edges.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all the noise reduction parameters you set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied using the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little softly is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use this tool to soften the softness with the menu entry Correct softness and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This restoration method gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film granularity, scratches, compression artefacts and local faults that occur in digital, original or subsequently digitized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration has been developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away from it. as a lossy compression algorithm it produces some compressions & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save As and Load buttons make exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce how a photo is reduced with uniformity noise.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Minolta (tm) HP-5 movie has been recorded with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious filmmaking on the faces. the original image is available under (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures were applied to an old color photograph that was scanned using a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by scanner illumination and photo paper. the original image is available under (1) and the corrected image under (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">Die & digikam; tool HotPixels allows you to remove Hotpixels from photos that have been captured with a CCD camera gem. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, protected by copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw mode, as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels quot; and 'quot; bright pixelquot; on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file in the wizard with the button darkscreen. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these will be highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you start the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD failures.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic dark image processing will detect the bad pixels. note that the wizard shows the last dark image and recharges it automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview will help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are uplifted in all previews.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the broken pixels on the preview and see the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">During: an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to compute a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of quadratic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compute a bi-cubic surface (2 dim) or a group of cubic curves (1 dim) which is then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">Die & digikam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor area equally. instead, & quot; vignetostenquot; (shady) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by lowering the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 for aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances, which makes it impossible to hold the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller because there are otherwise blurred effects caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of today's filters and the color and grayscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by using an equivalent transformation on a frame filter made without this filter. the tool VignettierungsSurgery applies the transformation with a Centerfilter to an image. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controls, you can control the Vignettierungscorrection filter and with three more exposure of the target picture.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light amplification at the point of the largest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or accidentally a luminous intensity of 2, reduce the density to compensate a small degree of vignetting.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, since you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of exposure of the finish image, leave the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the Edit menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignettierungscorrection on a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. an adjustment and contrast correction have also been done with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">Die & digikam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colorless distortion can not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree deals with the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex shape of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect, but flattens off the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficients fourth degree corrects the remote corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion second degree. with negative values tonal distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth degree. this value is stronger at the margins than in the middle of the image. for most lenses the 'Corner parameter has the inverted mark of the parameter generel.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and thus leads to a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image resize.</seg>
<seg id="583">Lighten: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The spherical or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before any trimming or size changes. the best result is that you perform this correction as the first. in case you re-cut a picture and then perform a spherical correction, the effect is apparently the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal guide line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to display dotted lines. move it to an important location, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the sound / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove it using the cutting tool in the menu Transforming trimming from image editing or using the Zoom slider of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs such as shots from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. keep in mind that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the spherical correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is shown in (1) and the corrected image under (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate the infra-red film of the Gimpanza.org web site which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduced the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters of film granularity and film sensitivity (ISO). turn on the Insert Filmcourge option if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO-controller changes the amount of the film granularity and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows become white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels for producing infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared film effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is available under (1) and the processed image under (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a type of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digikam; filter movie granularity is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce movie granularity on your pictures. this is known from classical high-speed films like the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the movies, the makers mix big silver grains of photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film body effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated image acquires a timeless atmosphere loose from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street-photo, granular view especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, set to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film-grained effect on a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digikam; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digikam; filter oil paintings give your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controllers to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brush is better for large images. smoothing the smoothness or, viewed from the other side, the hinge.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the editing is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and Glätte 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & Edit filter; Filter carbon drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal sketch. images whose gradients change slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine the scene you have chosen to sketch. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controller selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digikam; filter Gravure shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digikam; filter engravings is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works especially well in images with a simple structure, where color is not the most important at the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monotonous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the depth used is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortions. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave Block 1: splits the image into cells and makes it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the shaft blocks 1, the picture is distorted with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time for calculation and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects anytime with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom blurring: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a central point. this simulates the blurring of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: blurred the image by turning the pixels around a central point. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurring: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurring: blurred the image through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: camera shooting from a car or train.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening blurred: blurred the image softly into the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamor photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpen blur: blurred the image by a random shift of the pixels and simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the colour basins in the picture and wipes them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time for calculation and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button end.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look. it uses a protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digikam; image processing to hold an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can get it in the right direction by mirroring or rotating. the tools can be found in the menu Transforming Rotating or transforming mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo in case of minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture if the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you find the missing information again or guess? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change transforming size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Change the size of the tool using a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, try to inflate the tool.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to magnify an image. & digitised; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbine effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Load Knobs are used exactly for this purpose. enlarge each stables for photo, can be saved as a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo bubbles by enlarging a small picture on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear default magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cropping a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to assemble a picture. to cut a photo you have to create with the mouse just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle while moving the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the photo is cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging on the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can be created by dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The cutting button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo is trimmed (Ctrl; + X). use the Save file or Save file under the File menu to save the newly-cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">You can change the size of the rectangle in the preview area by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">Trimming in the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in the portrait aspect, the greater value is always assigned to the height and in the transverse width of the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">Cutting the tool after aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches, inches or any other physical size. you can e.g. see below a list of traditional dimensions for photo paper and its aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog two buttons exist to center the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog box, you can set the area for cutting to the maximum possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">Trimming the tool after aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (horizontal or vertical). if you use the trimming tool the next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF data, so that the EXIF data reflects the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The setup help settings allow you to insert aids in order to better assemble your pictures. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-party rule, harmonious triangles are a way of dividing a rectangle in a similarly harmonious triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division which is based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spirals of a Nautilus shell or the flower leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it has been used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who thus constructed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden graduation at all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition which follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid help lines when you put together an image. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal for your photos. compared to the third elbow, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition conducts the gaze of the beholder along the line of the spiral and creates on this kind a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. there should be something that distracts the eye into the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above. their vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal angles. diagonals to these lines can make a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break your frame create an effect called dynamic symmetry. try to place your image focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal and Vertical Options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the guides can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it is easy that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated by an angle. you can fix this with the & digikam; image editing and the tool free rotation. choose to move free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slide angle. the values on this slide are given in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider to 0 °. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right corner.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After turning a picture you will find undesired triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix it is to use the function Transforming trimming from image editing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to crop the image is the Automatically cutting function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option leaves the picture a bit after the turn. but keep in mind the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are performed by a fixed point to the so-called point of reference. this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will be recalculated automatically. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle links below: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle Right below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is blurred. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you've adapted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. a possibility to clean it is to cut the picture with transforming cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shading tool is used to move part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. a horizontal shift e.g. will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left. this is not a rotation, the image is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transforming scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Shear your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. you can shift both horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press presets, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">Move the mouse to an important point, like the lake, a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the shading tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you've done the shearing, the picture gets a bit blurred. for a single shearing this effect is mostly negligible, but two sets are generating twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shearing, the image has unsightly triangular holes in the corners. a way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transforming cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& Edit; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries have been compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digitizing.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency on other libraries it is impossible at this point to give a list of all file formats that are available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& Edit; shows only files in formats that are familiar with. this happens by file extension and comparing it with a pre-defined list. if the extension is listed in the list, it will edit & edit the file in image editing. you can change this list of file extensions and edit them. see the Configuration section for more information.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & Edit; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images. this reduces redundant information in order to save image data in a more efficient way.</seg>

<seg id="731">Additional required software: & kalliViewer; is a & kde; program which requires the & graphviz; -tool & dot; for representation of graphs. required are in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own sub-window. initially, if you start a graphic viewer; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the file icon and the (empty) list of last opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot; files, the main window looks like in the lower screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview in the corner is displayed if the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Using the mouse wheel (up and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt + button);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming in both directions is limited by a factor of 10. below is the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. & kGraphiviewer; can also memorize your decision, so that later will proceed as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can use the menu item SetScaleviewer; set up... see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">When you open a graph file outside a running & kGraphiviewer; instance, & eg; in the file browser or on the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new or knot viewer; instance or want to display the graphs to be loaded in a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice durably, but also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">Upon program start, you can open all graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice both save as well as later.</seg>

<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the default for uncoated graphs. it produces representations according to the jump spring model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is equivalent to statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a springsprint model for uncoated graphs. it uses the Fruchterman-Reingold Heuristics tab, and includes a multi-purpose trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm classifies the nodes in a circle according to the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is executed by a shell. the command should accept the graph file as a parameter, and output the computed layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can specify & eg; s & graphviz; algorithms change special options, or even change the graph with a filter before drawing.</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools for locating images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data, you need a GPS track as an XML file in the gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical Localization Korrelator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and go to the menu. the above-to-see dialog appears then. to load a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. this file contains of course data recorded at the same locations as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed that indicates the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera's time must be converted with GMT. this can be done using the time zone. set your camera time zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The adjustment for the maximum time deviation indicates the upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation is included, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from a location for pictures you can manually edit the gpx file and add it to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The interpolation and difference in min can be used if you have no matching data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog box addresses the coordinates of one call to the next, you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set up with the displayed map. to do so, select the region in question and enlarge it. repeat this time and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be manually selected. the card can be changed between card mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to attach GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Module Picture Gallery is a tool for exporting a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab selection allows you to select all the albums you want to export to HTML. you only need to select these albums. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums.</seg>
<seg id="824">The Appearance Appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. if you click on a picture a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default picture viewer, & eg; ickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The Rider Album defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all your associated images. select a folder where you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLSuite containing everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG File Format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">You can change the standard color depth with Other color depth, which of course also influences the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnails will allow you to customize some of the settings from the Album Reiter for thumbnails, which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors have occurred during production. the web browser will be started automatically at the end to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI Viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations like turns, zooming or postpone. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons. he has been developed for quick image display and quick access to his functions.</seg>

<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then open the file selection dialog with which you can select the destination image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write to any target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please look at exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodiver module is a tool for converting a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodiver module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. you can also add a base image transfer between the individual images. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV of the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slideshow. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. you can finally use the K3b program to burn the medium.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG Diashau. after that you can create the module via extras MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected are then listed under image files in the Portfolio. there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high, very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should leave it black. you can set the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG output file. if possible, keep the extension mpg.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after adjusting all settings to your wishes, you can use the encoding button to start generating the movie. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now quickly or quickly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow once you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages using the Settings icon on the bottom right corner.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image Gimp. this is useful e.g. to improve or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw of Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: do not expect from dcraw that it generates the same results as the software from your camera maker. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file to convert and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image. with the preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings are to be used for the white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A Four Color RGBG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG using a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you intend to edit your images often or otherwise continue using JPEG format, you should not select the JPEG format, as it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG File in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">The batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are certain, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing files automatically. this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar indicates how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the score and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or enlarge the image. for this purpose, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportionally (2 Dim.): change in size in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. for example, you can use this option to customize your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional size changes in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-press: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, border size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred E-Mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the images will be displayed with the selected images. by adding images, you can add more images with a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview is displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the list of images to add you to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">The button Images will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After selecting all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the OK button. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. the images you have selected are attached as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't mind to send too many pictures at once. most email accounts have restrictions on the size of emails sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration will be saved and used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments to the images will be added to a text file and the mail is attached.</seg>
<seg id="882">PNG format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG to image file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original exposure data will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages on the search for errors. your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau, a window will appear with questions like you want to display your slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album here.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL passes in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions by OpenGL. however, you will need to have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slideshow will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The Display file name option ensures that the file name of the images in the lower left corner is displayed during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The Loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop. you can then manually cancel it with Esc; Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used to order the images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The temporal distance between the images can be set between the pictures. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect. you should check this out before presenting your presentation to your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly, each transition between the images chooses a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can pause and restart the presentation, jump to the previous and next image and stop the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date has not yet been documented. if you are interested in writing it, please contact the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. attention: participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool for setting an image as a background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected submenu option, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations, you can use & kphotoalbum; browsing through these pictures. as you can see by comparing them with the image, there are now entries in each group, so in people, locations and in group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with comments. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course see the current preview images.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse over the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images on which both persons are shown. by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the persons, locations and other settings, you can display thumbnails to view the images of your area of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the image, each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can use & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own thumbnail, which is of course also true for places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the names, select the button located on the right of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, you can choose which view you want to use for each category. this has the advantage that you can display symbols with pictures of persons and a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must decide for yourself which image to display for each individual person. to do this, you need to open the image preview window (described in more detail) and select the categories editor in the context menu. here you can select the image for the respective person. in the view window, you can customize the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you enter the Find entry in the main window, a dialog will appear to show you a dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog once more.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the field of inscription or description, the captions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to be searched; the date can be either part of the total date, i.e., for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all the images according to certain names as you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the User Manual for & kphotoalbum; if you do not like to read manuals, but rather want to try the same features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the home page of & kphotoalbum; and watch the fast entry, screenshots and introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and select in the first dialog the demo, if you & kphotoalbum; launch for the first time, or select in the Help menu entry kphotoalbum; demo. then some sample images are loaded and you can try the features of & kphotoalbum; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you can find it on the Homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this bar displays you date statistics on the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different time units. each bar then displays another unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10 minutes sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed items preview view from the database (when you select a date, the first image of that date will appear in the preview window) and the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of timeline by holding down the mouse button and dragging the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, you will only see images of that period in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML web pages with your pictures. the one is integrated in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other available as a module (see). in the following part of the user manual is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version that you can create via the File menu...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages are created, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and target. in the following, each section is described in more detail.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the song and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; export file should be created which is visible on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can choose which information to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information appears, which are obvious to the viewer without description. for example, that all images are from a party. note that & kphotoalbum; therefore, you can't use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look. most settings are unique, which is why it is not specifically discussed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set various resolutions for the images. this means those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no more download images that have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you specified. so it can browse your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transfer time. if you want to get an image bigger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Please select a base folder for all of your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you must select the main folder in which all your pictures are saved. this folder will be saved and automatically completed next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can choose either a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if they are really visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created. the URL you specify here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files you created are not yet in the final destination folder, you have to manually copy them to it. so that the import function, see, properly works, you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder where all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings described above have related all three to base folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder will be created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; coming together, you might want to create your pictures with these. however, if you have spent a lot of time applying the image information, persons on the pictures, recording location, etc. then you have to work with & kphotoalbum; do not make this work again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kin file. these can import others into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file contains only a link to images. the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you have all the pictures together and that you can share this file as independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kin file directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kin file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in a twofold manner. first, it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kin file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can view from the File menu...</seg>
<seg id="937">The main option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. there are three choices available:</seg>
<seg id="938">If you want to copy the manual to the .kim file, you must copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically option to copy to the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu... select, it will import & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for import consists of four steps. first, you must select which images you want to import, then, in which folders you want to copy the imported pictures.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category of persons of the file to be imported (if you are a Dane), while this category is called people. therefore, in the third dialog box, you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories correspond to your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. for example, see the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It just has to be easy to browse and look at pictures: if you see pictures, you often want to jump inside of different picture groups. for example, if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pictured.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will pass the various steps from (1) to determine the information about your images, about (2) the browsing and viewing, to (3) advanced themes and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program for managing your pictures. however, it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; saves all of its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of your images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, to a disk or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; remembers the folder in which your pictures are stored and automatically restores them on future starts. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum; you can start a different folder tree with pictures, you can start & kphotoalbum; with option -c. as example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; set up... you can go to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual we will explain the different settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call by pressing a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can set different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups like objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog used to edit already existing groups. for each existing group you can select an inscription and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">Subcategories were already mentioned in the section. in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group, rather than all groups of a single member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the left panel of the list you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares its module system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this modular system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface. next information can be found on the Homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the Module menu. modules can and will not be described in this manual, since they are not part of & knot album; however, most modules have a help page that you can call via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by several applications together, it may be that the modules with & kphotoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database before you use them on your own pictures. demo database can be called either using the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use via KIPI are very different, whereby it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications can arrange their images in albums: this is an album simply a folder. even though & kphotoalbum; this type of order is not supported, it simulates order for albums so that you can use the features with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulated & kphotoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, i.e. all images that show you the picture preview right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album & kphotoalbum; the modules also have to pass a list of albums. here's & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, if you use the category people for example, you will do so, so do if you have selected people to view and share it with the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules are with & kphotoalbum; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do so, start the settings dialog and select the modules you want to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a starting screen when you start & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to by any other KDE application, you can see a menu bar at the top. under the toolbar, you will see the window with which you can browse your image database. in the section we will not find much information about your pictures yet. in the section we will display pictures that show you an overview of all available pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to provide any image with annotations. this includes information about the persons appearing in the image, etc. you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures simultaneously. if for example, on all pictures Jesper is mapped and all pictures recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these notes can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see these comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">Here you can see three lists with a text field by specifying people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; since you will always be using them whenever you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on shifting the images within the list: if you have a family celebration, for example, and on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons are shown, you can, so that the names used are moved upwards, the persons find and arrange them faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the sort by date icon on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected comments for each image individually, you may still want to edit all the selected images and add comments. in this case, simply click on the above and back buttons that are under the thumbnail of the image above.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have taken several images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the US. San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window showing the USA as an overprint. to show you that it is an overboard, a special icon will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the Comment dialog's context menu, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. in addition, you can also simply drag and drop an entry to a category to make it a subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can shift the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the buttons that form the top edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it outside the pane.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options... button that offers you the option to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also hide a frame completely. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then hide windows. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">When you select the images in your browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all images if you don't have filters. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of the thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be created as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will appear in the picture viewer. if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the Image preview. simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or choose Delete from the Edit menu. now the window that you can see in the picture will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; it offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphotoalbum; namely, you can have saved images anywhere, so that you can record the pictures anywhere, so that & kphotoalbum; you can view the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all needed pictures can be downloaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is clipped is not stored on the hard drive. however, for the images 5-9, the thumbnails are available, so that & kphotoalbum; you can also view these images with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy and copy files from the folders. & kphotoalbum; if you want to avoid trouble on how to avoid the jumble of your pictures, please buy a larger hard drive to save all the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the Image menu, you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end those remain that you want to make for others inaccessible and click on current view in the privacy menu. alternatively, you can also use all the pictures that your little sister can see, control and unlock the menu entry All other than current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">So you have set which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case. if you give your laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry pictures, which will fade out all the images you have locked. if you want to get the pictures displayed again, click Locking.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this image protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all images on the disk and on the other hand, anyone who can access the index.xml file can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is used only to deny the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason, & kphotoalbum features an image _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. of course, it shows the picture, but additional all the information you have entered about the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where has it been made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If you want to see the infobox on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag and drop it. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether any information is to be displayed. all of these options are available after a right-click on the viewer. the then appearing context menu can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here on the browser, see the matching entries to this. if you click on Anne Herein, the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Herein. as if you selected persons from the browser and then Anne Herene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have several images loaded in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the image up and down the image. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and End. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can let them run as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete room on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can zoom in and zoom in. to zoom in, you can simply pull out a rectangle with the mouse. with the minus key, you can zoom out the plus button zooming in the center of the image. shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zoom.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point key, you can reset your zoom, so that the image will not be zoomed. with the power button, the zoom starts, so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work in videos are that they come in and out with the plus and key key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">The rotation functions from the context menu allow you to rotate the image. this does not work with videos. you can make comments to the current image using the menu item Comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you look at pictures it can happen that you will find an image with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can browse the view and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter those names. however, you may prefer to mark only the image and view more images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see which photos you want, you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad, while you look one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to add pictures with features while you look at them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in the picture you can see a picture in which the marks A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your pictures, these are available in your browser. so if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, you can easily tag them all at once. this is described in. then you can use a module to copy the selected images onto a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in preview view. if you view categories in the particular preview view, you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the picture was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case allows you to paint photo album; on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image, but in the database. in this way, you can undo your painted one later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In the picture you can see a picture on which it was painted. to turn on the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; select View on the image from the context menu. to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovray; you need to use the program & Povray; not fully dominate, but the documentation to & Povray; should be read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire-model views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the object of an already selected object, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on either the toolbar icon or select a menu entry in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed so that you can select the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Delete selected objects from the scene using Delete either from the Edit menu or from the right mouse button context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to take those changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or reject the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; input the user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; -reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press Preview in the Properties view and a small example of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture. as default the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a sub-arranged element (for example, a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), tick the box locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a level of visibility as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher-level object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only when they are selected or their Visibility level is smaller or equal to the Visibility level selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it arbitrarily. you can also store multiple window orders and switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a view, drag the beginning to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view. the new view will then be anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange several views on top of each other, drag the beginner right in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the index tabs at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement is pending views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from anchoring, drag the beginning to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left at the beginning bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view click on the small cross at the beginning. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views to the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="1034">You can save the current window view with the window arrangement... Save. a dialog will appear where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render them. & kpovray; uses & Povray; 3.1g to render, this program must be properly installed. when this manual is written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the Rendering Symbol icon in the toolbar or select the menu entry View scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in View Render modes... select the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, useful is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box subsection and enter the image section for rendering in the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the combination field quality you can select the properties that & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of render properties can be found in the User's Manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">When a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn on anti-aliasing, compute and combine & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling includes the neighbouring pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is continuously divided and adapted because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels are calculated by pursuing a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4 x 5 (25) additional rays per pixel will be calculated.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are further pursued and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. when you turn on Jittering, changed & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray;, the diffuse light reflection calculates. it takes very long to let a scene calculate with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays didn't hit any object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; Import scene, select Import menu item... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command set by & Povray;. if error messages or warnings appear when importing, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two particular comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray. this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and pasting in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the Properties view, & kpovray; the & Povray; User Documentation to the displayed object. set the path to your document and the version. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (such as high-field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The colour for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type marks.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can adjust the grid separately for shifts, scaling and spins.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the level of detail separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high detail fidelity for advanced projections, all wire-model views will be further divided if the camera uses an advanced projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this property results in a better approach to projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you cross the wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">If you cross the floor, a floor underneath the objects is rendered. the floor is displayed in a chessboard pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the edge smoothing method, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering scenes. you can set the depth and threshold values in the Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window classifications. in the window arrangement, it will explain how to create and store window classifications.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The standard window arrangement: displays all existing window arrangement. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders shows all existing window configurations. you can create a new arrangement using the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement. new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">New column. create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with Unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with tab card you get a map view together with the previous view and floats the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, very popular among beginners: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen. if you are using a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules for rendering can be applied, as a result you will get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you just get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything without errors, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following preset window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the icons of the toolbar. please read the documentation to get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will often have to use these menus and symbols, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit menu entry. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire-model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the namespace camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the target position of the camera. just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the Apply button or the Enter key, the wire-model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, you see the scene from the perspective of the camera here.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the bottom for the scene. for example, you could insert a box (insert End Body Quader) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method of solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; offers actually a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as a floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply icon or the Enter key. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model view now also displays the plane, albeit at the moment only as a finite level. if you render the scene, the plane extends to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look closely at the object tree, you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor when you click on the + in front of the object. in this case you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. choose one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. choose a shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but select something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens, in which you can choose how to insert the object. please select first sub-object. the pigment is then displayed in the property tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = ground pigments), click on the preview button to see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigments preview only shows a matte black material, because you have to re-enter settings for the pigments. therefore always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time by clicking on preview. also, there are many possibilities, but now take the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the header and the ball in the preview, just click on the Apply button and then click on the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your picture with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you expected. here are other settings necessary. in the color list, you need to enter two new attributes, called one-color. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, choose one-color every time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should be able to perform this step already, since you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the sphere can be created just as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to push the input button or the application button), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground, since you moved the floor around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering now results in a strange result: as you can see before, the spherical surface appears like a matte black material. in the following step, place a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Once you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already on the floor, give the sphere a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first sub-object and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on Pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the following screenshots and click Apply or press the Enter key.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of the possibilities offered by you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you've learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracing is a render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracen, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders scenes) by each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this ray is reflected and broken by the objects, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog effect. thus the scene pixels are processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you also don't see anything, the image is simply black. obviously, every scene that should be rendered need some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file that you have previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since last storage will be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you haven't saved any saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last retracted command. you can only select this menu entry if you have used Edit / Undo.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, shortcuts and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change keyboard shortcuts. you can use this option to change short commands for & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog for setting up toolbars. using this option, you can add and remove tool icons for & kpovmodeler; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is a way to preheat rough surfaces without having to model each diffraction on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a dump map and texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic geometries are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& incubator; is a convenient image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & cubic show; is very easy. the file browser lists files that you can click on & LMBs, or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, just type the first character of the file name in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching filename is found, the file will be highlighted. you can exit the input field by pressing Return or Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the Setup - & Skills show; there are five card flashcards. in three of them, general and editing and slide show, you can set the mode of operation of & incubator; in the two other, short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser, the keyboard shortcuts can be set for each window.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images will be opened in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can set down further down. default is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">If this point is activated, the next image in the folder, while you still look at the current image. this reduces the delay if you select the next image and is especially suitable for a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option, & kuebelshow; when you finish the name of the last opened folder. at the next start, opens and displays the game; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored bar to select a background color. this is used in to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if the window is larger than the image in the window mode, the background is filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can set up & kick show; set up that only some of the file types can be displayed, which can also display the program.</seg>
<seg id="1140">This option increases the display window to the full screen for large images. this option is turned on as default.</seg>
<seg id="1141">Specify whether the slideshow will start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image.</seg>
<seg id="1142">To change the value, you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field. the default is 3 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1143">The number of repetitions. if this value is set to 0, the slideshow will be repeated until it is aborted by the user. to change the value, you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows right next to the input field.</seg>

<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script to see if all the required modules are present and use kdialog so that the user knows why a script does not run.</seg>

<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required features. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is using the dcop command; any KDE installation should be included.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow executing external programs and commands. for this purpose, the function exec () is usually used. this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively simple. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this reason strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should continuously monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore the events even if it has no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Run the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok places the working folder to the folder where all data should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange Signalizes that a new piece is being played. the script could now query & zb; with DCOP functions, you can query more information about the new track (for example, the metadata or the unit length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customizing menuClicked: submenu itemTitle Paths Includes the path to the selected files of the playlist, if a custom menu entry is clicked. to add a custom entry, you can use the dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle) to remove an entry. to remove an entry you can use dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the SIGTERM signal to the script. this signal should be processed, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that the user and zb has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend an archive name such as me skript.amarokscript.tar.bz2, so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept scripting packages with the amarokscript deployment. for this reason, you should name your script parcels right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the -p Tar parameter -p to obtain the file permissions:</seg>

<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and no other KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs installed (including the included programs, because & Amarok; requires some to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small tutorial on how to compile kdelibs minimally.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features such as the OSD presuppose that your window manager will keep the relevant standards from freedesktop.org. Gnome will thus work, but fluxbox will help for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Taglib library for days. you can locate the file by using ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developers at bugs.kde.org and also hang the broken file causing the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly this is because Taglib crashes while reading the meta-information from this file. please report this bug to the Taglib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database then try SQLite. support for this in & Amarok; is somewhat mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all libraries used by & Amarok are compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & Amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, Taglib but GCC 3.3.X then this leads to crash when editing the Meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable auto. turn off when inactive for... in adjusting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail opens automatically at a crash). if this is a common crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta-information, but do not mark it as Unicode. the following perl script fixes the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1326">Creating a playlist is very easy. drag and drop items from the collection browser to the playlist. the small text box to filter the collection makes it easier for you to search for certain pieces. if you are satisfied with the playlist, you can save them using the playlist's button under saving. you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1327">If you have your own playlists, you can add them to the playlist browser. if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection, and you have enabled the playlist to import playlists, then these playlists are already in the tree view. by right-clicking on a playlist, you will find various ways to load the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1331">& Amarok; presupposes the installation of some software packages. the required packages are listed below. additionally, some extra packages are listed that make the work with & Amarok; more enjoyable.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you must also install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player has also & Amarok; a player window with the most important features. additionally, & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to all others. the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & Amarok; Control Center. at the top of the window is a run text display showing the current running piece or the current stream. just below is the area, the playing time, bit rate and sample rate of the current piece. a click on this area changes the display of the previously expired playing time to the remaining time of play.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, even under the drive text display. you can switch from the available analyzer by right-clicking on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current Analyzer is displayed in an independent, magnifying window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are also included under the running text display. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlists window, while the EQ button is used to set up Equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the piece-position slider. use the sliders to adjust the play position or volume. with the playback buttons you can start / stop playing and change to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">Using the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own default settings.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer, use Extras Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the equalizer check box, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The & Amarok playlist; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players. it has many features that are not available in any other player. but don't let the wealth of features deter you, they're all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left is the navigation pane. in the navigation pane, you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist, such as the context browser. on the right you find the playlist itself.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays various information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be adapted with context browser design. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, Text and Interpret. these three subwindows will be explained in detail later.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you might notice that the subwindow is dropped off. the information presented there are now distributed in other parts of & Amarok. in addition, the information can be viewed in the statistics window (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first area in this sub-window displays information about the piece. in the title you will find the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you can see the cover image of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to recreate the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Below the MusicBrainz symbol you will find more information about the current piece. you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in the context browser, the covers must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the images can have any name but pictures with the word front in the name are treated preferentially. the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on any of these pieces, it will play immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the pieces recommended are the favourite pieces of this artist. this area shows the five highest scores of the current artist.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information to display in the music subwindow. to do so, right-click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums from the current artist you have in your collection. when you click on an album, it will work up and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately. you can also right click on it and then select one of the possibilities to add the play or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is yet running, you can choose which one to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version will then be saved in & Amarok's collection database. no running text script is needed to do so.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Group interprets - only group the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Group Interpret / Album - First the pieces are sorted by artist and among them will be a further division according to the respective album. if you want to see compilations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums will be shown at the beginning of the list under different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Group Interpret / Year - Album - Sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the latest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default is 0 - Albumname related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are arranged alphabetically by each other. the artist will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - Your pieces are displayed first by genre and among them by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the artist.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the remaining buttons you can customize and combine grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically recount your collection once you change something on the selected folders. if you own many pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located directly under the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. notes on how to use this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter there is a selector with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. there are different time windows available, starting from the last 24 hours up to a year. in addition, you can also choose your complete collection, which makes the filter practically switched off.</seg>
<seg id="1368">Clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser gives you the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This empties the current playlist and adds the selected pieces to playback in the current order.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to Playlist - Adjust the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on one entry you will get the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue. this will be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name to save the list.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to media player - Add the pieces to the queues for the media player. more details can be found in the section on the Media Player Browser.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / Burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces are sent to K3b and either burned as data or as audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Opens the piece information dialog and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) Move the files into the trash bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark the compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears under different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Picking up a compilation - Changes a album marked as a compilation back into a normal album. after that, the album will no longer be displayed under different interprets, but again under the corresponding performer.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The Playlists browser makes it easy to deal with many playlists. among other things, it also includes Intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. they use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click Smart Playlist to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The subwindow Media Player is used for the connection of & Amarok; using your portable media player (e.g. iPod). to be able to use your iPod with & Amarok; if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist sorted in the top list view of the media player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list performer. when you're done, click Apply. by doing that, the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod. if the commit completes, quit & Amarok; and solve the drive commitment to your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar, there is a search area that allows you to search for a file. the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from an entered URL. if you want to tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz and press Enter, you can drag and drop music from there to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">When the playlist is longer than it is in the window, it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping it. in that case, holding down the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply drag and drop the entries with the mouse to the desired location. as soon as you enter letters there are only the pieces that contain the letters. to reset the filter, press the back button for as long as the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter search terms separated by spaces, & Amarok; search for entries containing all search terms. for example, if you enter one or two, the search will find all entries containing one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter OR between the search terms, search for entries containing either one or the other search term. for example, one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces containing one or two or three are found (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain spaces, then enclose the search term with goose bumps: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that include Mike Oldfield, but not by entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you can also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: review: &gt; 50. This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific keyword, set a minus sign before the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this search for all pieces that contain either Mike Oldfield or a higher rating than 50 and not include the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key, and then right-click in the desired order to click the entries. the entries then receive a mark with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist. it includes buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left you will find the Add button to add pieces to the playlist. to the right, you will find playlists, empty playlists and Randomph mixing.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow undo and restore, so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar there is a unique, magnified analyzer. the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as what you see in the player window using the right mouse button. via this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more buttons available for the toolbar, such as playback control and volume control. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbar buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it shows the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and retrieval, a slider for the play position and the playing time of the current play will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do this, disable the status bar option in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the playlist in the playlist. via this menu you can click the Options of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1404">A click on this entry opens the visualization plugin window. there you can select the visualizations of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1405">This entry contains a sub-menu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The Cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images. you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover administration includes a list view of all albums in your collection. you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu you can choose what to display in the cover administration. select from:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue management received your big entry in & Amarok; 1.3. with this feature, you have even more control over the playlist. after you have set a piece in the queue, the playlist will appear next to the title. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces will play: 1 is played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">When you want to add a piece to the queue, select the piece in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces to the playlist or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue administration.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, two of which have already been pre-set (the details on how to set up these later).</seg>
<seg id="1412">Fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds further random pieces while playing.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Add pieces based on Last.fm recommendations (formerly: Audioscrobbler). this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist. you don't need a load .fm profile for this dynamic playlist to work.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Double click on the playlist you want, drag it to the playlist window or click with the right mouse button and then select Load. so, your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1415">The two preset modes Random mix and playlist mix instantly populate your playlist and you can start playing directly. the list of recommended pieces begins with an empty playlist and you have to add at least one piece by yourself from your collection. the recommended pieces are added at the next piece change, so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1416">If you want to keep the current playlist, enable the last possible dynamic mode: settings Dynamic Mode. this will use your existing playlist as starting point. using the same menu entry, the dynamic mode can also be disabled again.</seg>
<seg id="1417">The New button automatically populates the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode. editing a playlist opens a dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Right-clicking on a dynamic playlist gives you the option to click Edit. after that, the dialog box will open to edit the playlist's settings.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Enter any name for the playlist here. however, the name should be unique to avoid confusion.</seg>
<seg id="1420">If this setting is not active, your playlist will be continually growing, the setting for future pieces will be skipped and you will not hear a piece duplicate in this playlist. if the setting is active, the already played pieces will be removed in observance of the settings.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist, so you can easily see which pieces were recently played.</seg>
<seg id="1422">This is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played piece. if you set more than 1, then the playlist will grow continuously, because only one piece can be played and removed.</seg>
<seg id="1423">The right side settings have already been described in the previous section. on the left side of the dialog, you can select existing playlists or smart playlists. if you cross multiple playlists, & Amarok will add random items from each of the playlists you have crossed.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Some scripts enable your own settings. you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click on Setting.</seg>
<seg id="1425">You can install new & Amarok; scripts by clicking on the install script. a selection dialog will open in which a script package can be selected for installation. after you have installed the script, a new script will appear in the list. you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="1453">Normalize: this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level. this can e.g. make sense to create mixed CD's and Mp3 collections; without normalize, the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unattractive effect that the music pieces play differently.</seg>
<seg id="1454">EMovix: this is a very small Linux distribution. it contains the necessary software to be able to start from CD and to automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1455">This is a convenient way to recharge recently opened projects. the associated sub-menu contains a list of these projects. click on an entry to open the project.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Save the current project. once the project has been saved, the previously created file will be overwritten, otherwise it will be asked for a new filename.</seg>
<seg id="1457">Save the current project under a new filename. KDE's Dialogue Save As appears to allow you to choose folder and file name for the project file.</seg>
<seg id="1458">Saves all opened projects. this is the same as if you were going to save file for each project file.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Closes the current project. if a project has been modified and not yet saved, ask & k3b. you can then choose between saving and changes. you can also abort the closing and keep the project open.</seg>
<seg id="1460">Closes all opened projects. & k3b; will enquire for any unsaved project that is supposed to happen, just as if you had called for each project file close.</seg>
<seg id="1461">Closes all opened projects and terminates & k3b;. for any unsaved project will be asked what to do with it as if you had called file closing.</seg>
<seg id="1462">When you access this entry, you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog. this will have the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the Project View. if the current project is a data CD, the files added will appear in the CD's base folder.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Opens the dialog "Burn" for the current project. this dialog is basically the same as the project's properties dialog. the only difference is the additional button burning, the & k3b; to burn the medium. the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of which are described by the What is the? remedy described (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it causes & k3b to import files from a previous session into the current project. this is useful when you merge files for a multi-session CD. the data from the previous session will always be included even if this feature is not used. it is intended for you rather than help to view the files and folders that already exist on the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this feature causes & k3b to remove imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project. this function does not remove files from the media, it only discloses the previously imported files.</seg>
<seg id="1467">This allows you to copy a CD to another medium without project file. alternatively, you can only create an image from a CD which you can then burn later on. you should also prefer cloning instead of the normal copy. you should prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Open the DVD Copy dialog. this allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without project file. alternatively, you can only create an image of a DVD which you can then burn later. besides, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of the normal copy. furthermore, the target medium must be large enough to record the entire (video) data of the source media in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog to delete a CD-RW. this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Open the dialog to format a DVD. with this dialog you can format a DVD + R (W), whereby the content is completely deleted. & k3b; lets you choose between the writing modes review and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Burn a previously created CD image. the dialog will prompt you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button. (Nero * .nrg files are currently not supported yet, you have to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burn a previously created DVD image. the dialog will ask you for a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burn button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A previously used DVD video can be converted. this dialog window will usually appear after reading a DVD in the content view, but can also be used alone. it contains information about the selected video, encoding settings, and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the inserted medium. this information is displayed in the content view and contains features of the medium, such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Displays a list of the toolbar of & k3b; if an entry is checked, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">When this is enabled, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, their content is displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media Info, Locking and Unlocking the disk or ejecting the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view allows selecting and dragging files into the project view. the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs, if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow area that is only visible when the projection screen contains open projects. the header has no real function, it only looks nice and separates the project view from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box to change key assignments for & k3b;. after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, the key assignment can be adjusted further below.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; Setup Wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs. for this purpose system administrator privileges are required, so you must enter the password for the system administrator (root) at the start of the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b should work right away. this dialog is intended to personalize and fine-tune the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also, equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled, for example, via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can use either the command line program dcop, or the somewhat more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and type of task is crucial, which of the included programs will give you the default.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you use the dcop command line program. to be able to use the & DCOP, you must first make sure that & k3b; then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions common to all & kde; -program in common, support & k3b; mainly two more parts which are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The & k3b standard DCOP interface provides functions such as copyCD, formatted DVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createActivate CDProject () DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () void burnCdrw () void burnCd () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage () void burndvdImage (KURL url) void burndvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively, you can create a project via the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project by using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above-listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder void createFolder (QString name, QString parent) void url (KURL:: list urls, QString parent) void renameItem (QString path, QString parent) void setVolumeID (QString path) void setVolumeID (QString)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then inserts files into the new folders:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudioCreator; is an audio CD; Audio CD; it can easily be read and stored in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudioCreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard disk) and by many encoders that encode these wav files (these encoders are still being installed from the Linux distribution). other encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these wav files (usually one per title) are compressed into mp3 or OGG format or other formats like the lossy FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudioCreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, it must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all of these programs are usually installed for any Linux distributions, so it is probably not necessary to compile something yourself. however, if FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">What encoding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compressing factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & audio-creator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device prevents the protection, it is not possible to circumvent protected audio CD; even avoid the mechanisms of copy protection. just avoid purchasing copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up has to be done only once (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found), afterwards the daily usage for reading a & CD; on the hard drive explains. this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the user interface, which you will frequently stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert to many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; fetch information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without a network, where everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. in the step by step example, you will find more information about how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">CDDB Enquiry into CD data according to the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this may be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if an encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup Catalog - encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Open a sub-menu with a list of encoders available, so that the selection can be read with another encoder than the default. note that the encoding settings in the encoding settings tab have been configured in the setup dialog before.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already selected file is selected for encoding rather than a full & CD; read and encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as protocols, pics) for program events (such as read out the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Open the main setup dialog of & kaudioCreator; with different card flashcards (such as Encoder, setting up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a loss-free audio format is required. besides FLAC, there are other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly any commercially available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on your psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in audio quality at lower bit rates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate, the differences become less important as both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame will still be supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open licensing issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high sound quality (at high bit rates), but slightly lower quality compared to OGG with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG voting machines exists.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be listened to on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto-stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression ratio around 5.5. requires 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all tracks of a song. good enough for music from youths, portable devices and car park facilities. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or retrieved by the program automatically from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / use with & kaudioCreator; and the encoding program to generate folder and file names as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help of the encoder explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; title to keywords (English: tag) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioCreator; parameters needed (= button labeling in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter information, so that all others can download the information instead of yourself. it is important to note that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal but I (note of the translator) is not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent that you from the & CD; information published on the CD; more or less worthless so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can be obtained anyway with a bumblebee through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudioCreator; is active to select a check box (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it seems that the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (but this can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudioCreator; used to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD;. alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know it more precisely, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CDs; see note is that the cdparanoia package must be installed first from the appropriate distribution if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For saving the read wav files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at first opening there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (lossless compression for audio data) on the tab to set the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The package must be installed from the related Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the pre-defined encoders. for more information on Kodierer, refer to the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and reading rights on it and whether both cdparanoia and audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy-protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; this will not work!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with one step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you'll get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution, for example, a suitable package for lame can be found with a search engine as it is considered non-completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write privileges on it (eg by trying to copy something in it).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set-up of & kaudioFirmware;, something that is likely to be done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each reading & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we define the encoders for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not change it every time you read a & CD; change if once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is handed over to the reading program so that it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look at the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries present on the device designations for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card card General Settings. here there is not much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything will be left as shown / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Please select only for incomplete information, so that you will be informed if information on creating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card CD; -Settings. simply select both entries. we are convenient and allow the & CD; download data automatically via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, becomes a & CD; entry found, immediately starts reading the & CD;. this is associated with low risk, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag records, they can easily be changed. the directory and file name will be changed with Konqueror &gt; renaming and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to manually enter everything manually, deactivate the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you download the database before. however, this is over 620 MB, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for calling the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section about freedb. put everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this way, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">They both function equivalent to the server, since many firewalls boot the protocol 8880 by default, there might be more luck with the protocol 80, because the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we don't want to transfer data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure that the / tmp folder exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously reading pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, therefore simply try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; discard after reading the last piece: check this to the & CD; discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must be specified the path / folder where the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget that folder if you want to do something yourself with the wav files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something has to be browsed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bit rate is average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression ratio is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the creation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if needed. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of subsequent change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneous to encoded wav files: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be attempted to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudioCreator; finished. this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a & CD; used. if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it describes how the process of reading the & CD; on the hard disk runs out. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, was described in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is structured, since we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb must be picked up. the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each reading & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD; use that is not yet in freedb, the screenshots look somewhat different than those obtained for a CD; with successfully fetched data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; manually enter data instead of fetching them from the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Do not try the & CD; this example can be found. it is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, the & CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; can be identified as an audio CD; and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, look for the help section in the Questions and Answers section or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully picked up by the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; there, a window appears, and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you did not select the check box for the automatic retrieval of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD-Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current Title', the rest of the data in the 'Album' input field.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer needs to be entered in the 'Current title' input field unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom comment field can be used for each commentary volume individual per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply common to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album names (e.g. whether all words with uppercase letters begin or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece, and only 28 characters for the commentary box. if you use ID3v2 tags, you will have unlimited field length, at least for what & audio-Creator; maximum allowed. this option is set to the 'Basic Settings' tab.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coding or file formats. see the help of the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously complies with the style of the read-out CD; in this example, this is not important as we don't provide the & CD; for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "after choosing" "" "OK" "" "you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data, which we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece in any case and any other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the song data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Note: this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button on the toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be shown above the parts list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece one or off. make sure that all pieces are selected, or press the All items button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at a time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When you click on the selection button to read the selection process, this window will appear for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what's going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab Orders to switch to the order window. it is located in the left upper half of the window, just below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the jobs. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You will see this error message if you try to work with a encoder that you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red 'X' in the job list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occured immediately after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The job 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: contract 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into MP3 format. thus, read out and encoding at the same time. note the status message at the bottom of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that appears to be configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and encoding. the resulting machine with an AMD64 does not seem to have any problem at simultaneous reading and encoding (of though two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read while another piece is encoded and a third order is placed in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window is displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudioFirmware;, you need & kde; 3.x. resp. 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">If you are familiar with CVS, you can download an anonymous copy from there. however, most distributions already contain a pre-compiled package, there & kaudioCreator; a part of an important & kde; package is. if you are reading this, you probably have already done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is directed to people who compile from source files, and not intended for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help how the program can be customized to your needs, then the following is true for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs has many settings. it's best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it displays screenshots of the different tabs of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still reading? even if only the help menu was clicked after the first start of the program, without any clue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program start), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it all about? who reads this has probably already started the program. it should look something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately, no e-mail. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is the first version for a manual for & kaudioCreator; thought. whoever wants to add or change something useful, may it. and if you read this, he has left this section and is therefore in agreement with this suggestion.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange if you managed to get the source file from the & kde; SVN, then you don't need these informations, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Karaokespieler of & kde; beside others it has real-time graphics and karaoke real-time highlighting of lyrics also some features that other & UNIX; -MIDI players have not.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs on & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so should work on all systems with OSS - and kde; support also the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver, which is needed for GUS cards. ALSA is involved as soon as it supports a sequence.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, so it's easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphic representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag and drop so that you can drag in & kde; any MIDI file from a & konqueror; -window on kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports both existing standards for storing text in MIDI files (song events or textual events). kmid automatically calculates the process used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session Support. when you quit & kde; when playing a song, kmid will start with the same song the next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog, with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; -window into the & kmid; -window. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button on the toolbar, select the entry Remove from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the & kmid window. (for several pieces, you will be added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once you play a piece, you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and moving back and forth with the controller.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click the arrows left and right of the template and change the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double-click the template LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a play is played, a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the pause button or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item, so interrupts the play.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use text events, others use song textures and others. some songs don't have any text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type will automatically determine which one song is used, so that you do not need to manually adjust the selected karaoke text, but you still have the option to change it if you want to see the other type.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type, select the menu events and / or songs from the Settings menu. the same function also has the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. these are played back in series. in this section you can find how you can efficiently use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you can find it in the menu item under the point Organize.... Click New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the desired size in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection will not be saved. keep in mind when you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you have to be selected in the collection manager. there, you can add a song with the Add button. it appears in turn the file dialog, with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Add to Collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection while opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add-on to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when opening a piece. the collection will then be added to the remaining pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you have to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the submenu Abplay sequence of the menu items, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the select list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump one song further, select the next song's button next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump reverse a song, select the button Item number, the entry Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter since it is not stored when leaving.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI map is translating general MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in the events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and always lets you sound a trumpet when a piano was originally to play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need a MIDI map because all the sound cards GM are compatible (including Awe and GUS cards, FM radio devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all required settings for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as many times as you wish. but the requirement is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of the keymap"... END Define keymap "Another Keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You can see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an email so that I can offer in future releases of & kmid; support can be for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, you specify how General MIDI cartridges are mapped to your specific keyboard. general usage looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equals sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you can't change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument need to put on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60) which sounds similar to a gun.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (bullet), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60 regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is the term drum-patch of the patch, where each sound represents another percussion instrument (drum, basins, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how tones are mapped on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of rows is very important, as well as their presence.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several key maps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Key maps are used above all to map the sounds on the percussions channel. see, for example, the provided Keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, simply do this in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap with the name name for this channel will be used. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will try to change the patch on this channel.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if so, a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, this is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file no decimal comma is standing).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM gives a keyboard that is supposed to play a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, to play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two sounds up to one octave up. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog, which can be found in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole string of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a select list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button does not light green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to display the played sounds. view the View menu under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace LCD indicates the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so, for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 Kb while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer, you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid. this happens because & kmid; compiled without AWE support. to remove the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supports & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder that you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Be sure to activate Automatic Add to Collection. otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. to restore the standard tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & kde; -Desktop a & konqueror; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or tacked (when I play a karaoke file) or I want to play a file, just switch to the & konqueror; -window and drag the desired file into the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding it to a collection, turn on the Automatically add to the collection, and the new one; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. First you just want to play the first file. so set the setting Automatic Add to the collection and open A.id. your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play Bmid and C.MID and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, that animates me to further write to & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Malaga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Malaga. at the moment I am in the third year, so I don't have much free time for my hobbies, but I try to take a bit of time.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or if you just want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">They make me really happy when sending me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will count among friends of & kmid; however, before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me, since I may already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I've written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and won't get money from anyone. I would therefore like to emphasize that I'm only programming it because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AWE cards.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also apply to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the AWE support, Ignacio Garcia for testing AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Peter Gritsch, Magnus pepper, Urko Lusa, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, error correction or even a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course, thanks also to all of these excellent musicians on the net, who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, can be found on his homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarcent / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, search information and look at pictures. you will also find links to pages with other karaoke songs, etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends much on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you must compile it and compile with the MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL parameter. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can of course not hear music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple user interface for MPlayer, Phono and FFMPEG. the program is used to play video files created by MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, as well as DVD's, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished as & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called docking windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save preferred links under the Bookmarks menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level. if you select an entry, its group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the selected record.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current pieces', television and permanent playlists can also be changed by direct editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do this if & KMPlayer; not running. the different files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / SMB /, can be changed by an editor, and next edit mode. by clicking on a sub-group, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to select the playlist from the menu list and select either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without using the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some features can only be enabled by changing XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / kmplayerrc and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 oblast option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / SPlayer / introxml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / SPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at startup doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be disturbing at the end-animation, the user can therefore end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; & lt; & lt; img dur = "Ing dur" src = "file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet" / lt; /\; /\; /\; /\; /\; /\; /\; /\; /\; /\;\\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab to configure MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for debugging is the button 'Console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / kmplayerrc, like setting up the backend by mimetype. here's an example how a 'flash' with the module swf dec-mozilla is played:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">In order for the & KMPlayer to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer must be specified as a service provider for the Mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file Zuorders of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library. the started process is called knpplayer. if no errors occur here, the backend issue is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">In order to always use a given backend for a particular mime type (of course only if it has been determined), this must be done by manual modification of the file ~ / .kde / share / kmplayerrc. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play cards from TV, either via MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be stowed, the device to use and the TV channels must be configured. to do so, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (video data recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in Settings - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port is to be used. there should be identified ports from which one is selected. the encoding must be found (for example, it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably contains a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support for SMB can only be used by XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). therefore, the videoforlinux extension for the X server must be functional. therefore, the XFree86 server must contain the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, SMB uses different names for the sources. at the time of creating this documentation, this is dvdnavasset, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlresource, vcdsource and vdrone. when enabled, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there indications how to quieter my CDROM drive quieter if I play it off (not on the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command HDPARM -E 8 / dev / cdrom can be run as a user root after the device is plugged in. it is essential to ensure that / dev / cdrom is shown on the CDROM drive.</seg>

<seg id="1742">Latex;: a professional typing application. under Unix-like systems, probably the package & texlive; or & tetex; (for older systems) is used.</seg>
<seg id="1743">Most of these components can be included in the used & Linux; distribution should be included in the distribution or installation CD; / DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1744">The & Kile; Project contains some pre-compiled packages of & Kile; for various distributions. these allow easy installation without further compiling and are included on the box; -website.</seg>
<seg id="1745">This manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with & latex;, & kde;, & Kile; or & Linux;.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Advanced users probably don't have to read this manual. however, all suggestions for documentation are taken into account. if the support for this project or its documentation is desired, the contact should be made via the Kile; -Website.</seg>
<seg id="1747">If you have any questions regarding the compilation of & Kile, or if extensions are requested, this should be addressed to the mailing list Kile-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net.</seg>
<seg id="1748">& Kile; is an integrated & latex; environment for the & kde; -Desktop. & Kile; provides the ability to use all & latex; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple, immediate and customized access to all & latex; programs. furthermore, the easy-to-use assistant, the & latex; -reference and the powerful project administration need to be called.</seg>
<seg id="1749">To learn more about & kate; and learn about its possibilities, the manual can be consulted to Kate. users of & Kile; can start working directly with the editor of & kate directly with reading the chapter.</seg>
<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the proper pronunciation: Lay-TECH. while the original & tex is very difficult to use, a layman can also use latex; a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it descends from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">While only a good overview of & latex is given, it is not the ultimate book. to be able to properly control, good books should be used e.g. H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1752">Just like other markup languages includes & latex; an introduction with which the general characteristics like paper format, page numbering and text size are specified as well as a body with the text. the introduction contains at least the command\\ documentclass, the body begins with the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quick-Entry Wizard of & Kile; is a useful feature for speedy preparation of a document in & Kile; selecting the Assistant (Mention) offers some possibilities for creating the document. there may also be some settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this includes the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], letter [letter], article (DIN) [scrreprt], book (DIN) [scrreprt], projector [beamer], slides [Prosper] or user-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: this defines the encoding of the system. modern systems increasingly use UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best UTF-8X should be used (for correct processing of the & latex; documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used additional packages for & latex; for integration they only have to be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), report (DIN), letter (DIN): the documentation classes of Koma-Script (to comply with the German DIN regulations).</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users now don't have to worry about it. this is just a brief description of the functions and further information is given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; offers - as well as other source code editors - the highlighting of the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable). by & Kile; if you want to see greater areas of a green text on the screen, it is quite likelihood that some mathematical environment is not closed. however, you will be spared by the modest appearance of the output file.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With automatic execution of the environments, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) of & Kile; automatically generates an empty line (for entering the text) and the corresponding line to the position of the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be set up in the menu Setting... LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are normally divided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document in the following elements (part is the highest and subparagraph of the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">With the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful. as soon as a DVI; file [close to D e V ice I ndependent file]] was created, jumps & Kile; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI; viewer to the corresponding line in & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of formatted document and also other information such as font and is next to PDF the digital output tray of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; -files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When troubleshooting the elements of the DVI; file with the editor, and once clicked on an element in the DVI; file, the corresponding section in the & latex; source code is jumped. once clicked on a section in the & latex; source code is jumped to the appropriate place in the DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this feature is used for working with multiple files. with a master document, work with other embedded .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set over project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick Construction: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless there is no error in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">Video surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file is on the tonnderungâ and it is not called up & ocular; after the quick-construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit tool bar, the three large selection fields should be noticed. the selection fields have been developed for fast insertion of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for the quick classification of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; -Commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection field Other is for inserting items such as tags, footnotes or references. the available options include:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a name for a section, a picture or different element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Cover: used for reference to a specified term (selection possible via a selection field).</seg>
<seg id="1773">Using quotation marks a selection list with literary entries. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. for editing & bibtex; -files are appropriate editors necessary. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; -files can also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box labeled GrÃ ¶ BEe is used for the definition of the font. the fonts can be specified for the main text, the description notes, etc. the following fonts are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and legend of settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] specifies the font width. if the font is not specified at the beginning, this can also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once you have entered the above source code, the & latex must be compiled; the simplest way to do this is to use the Start Building or the Quick Construction Button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling. & Kile; automatically executes the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compilation of the document fails, it should be looked for in the logging of the errors. when using quick-construction, & eyepiece should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be followed.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font name 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} will allow the annotation of the fonts within the environment as well as "Riesling" (English Huge).</seg>
<seg id="1781">Changes are only carried out within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} until\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and ease of use of the document. for example, certain fonts, bold type, italics, substrokes, etc., can be added. these commands end with the\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the italics pressure and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a sentence can be italic with\\ emph {word} in italics.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quota: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {rate} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source text was presented with the & latex; markup language, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard, some adaptations should be made for better readability of the document. this should include a quotation, a few passages in bold and italics, and a poem to the application to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, Editor View or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (for the internal viewer). in an external viewer, the window has to be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into a & postscript; / PDF file. simply try it and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (English D e V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file the same steps are necessary as for creating the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can be printed (in the viewer) by file printing (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI; file was created from the & latex; source code, the conversion into desired formats can start using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preview search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; -Binding files. to do this, just set up Modern under Settings Box... Building tools can be balanced.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To run the preview search, the mouse pointer must be clicked in a line of the source text and then clicked on the previous search. the jump to the corresponding point in the DVI; viewer will then take place.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document from & Kile; open and jumped to the corresponding line. to do this, & Kile; in & Okular; set up as text editor (Set up eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If there is no error in using the Quick Building of the & DVI; the viewer may have an error. if there is an error, this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file explains the source of errors in the source code. in the editor you can then use the Relative LaTeX error and NÃ ¤dFirst LaTeX error for jumps between the errors. in order to view the faulty line, the error in the logging must be clicked and & Kile; jumps to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once clicking on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template to use for the document. the default options include:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document. more information is included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Height users of & latex; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created in & Kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be open or create a new file. & Kile; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document... create.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template by file New, some strings will be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings Box... Settings can be set in general.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template it is necessary to know which strings will be replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is substituted by entry into document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the standard one.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files are created. if a simple way to create a template is scanned, it should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below are searched.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kate; used as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting of many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & kate; can be made in the menu directly from & Kile; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & kate; and to learn about its possibilities, the manual must be consulted to Kate. users of & Kile; can start reading the chapter's work with the Editor of & kate; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference which can be called via the LaTeX reference menu. it contains a detailed description of nearly all the commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double click with pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; this means that by clicking on\\ par the\\ par\\ bigskip is only\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with a left mouse button, the selected text will be automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with the Shift key pressed, parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse most different kinds of source code and highlight these. for example, the & latex; -Commands differ from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can hold additional jump marks. this is a separate type of bookmark within the text. the menu items Edit jumping brands or the corresponding keystrokes allow the jump to the next or last jump stamp. this is also highlighted by this jump stamp so that it is automatically detected at the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as & Kile; although & kate; already excellent options include, were included in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source text added. & latex; frequently supports many environments and groups and therefore supports & Kile; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Select a complete paragraph (group of lines containing an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only exploiting thing in & Kile is that the text is separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Choose the word from the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also includes & latex; commands with a return string (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, natally it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & kate; offers the keystroke Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & Kile; offers with its own commands for faster possibility. under Edit Removal the following commands are included to delete the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is contained in the description to edit select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore offers & Kile; for other commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command will jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the surroundings of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or within the command\\ begin {environment}, jumped to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">In the input of many nested environment commands, the overview can quickly be lost. this command will close the last opened environment so that the nested surrounding structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also provides special commands for the & latex; groups which are determined by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from edit environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opened bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curly closed clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is on or behind the curly bracket of a & tex; -group #, jumped to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested groups braces, the overview can quickly be lost. this command will close the last opened group so that the nested structure of the & tex; -groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple reference marks are used as a device. for the practical implementation, the character is used in & Kile; the sign "is used for two simple reference marks." & Kile; knows this case and supports two closing quotes for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic insertion of the double quotes can be set up under Settings Box... Let LaTeX be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used to customize specific settings (e.g. French or french) and therewith German or French quotes. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When pressing Shift; Enter key for & Kile; an intelligent line break. if the current position is within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not only a line breaks but also the\\ item command.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Enter the current line with\\\\ with a close line break in a table environment.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is intelligent enough to support pre-set & latex; - or custom environments. you can set up under Settings Box; Set Up... LaTeX to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users would like to arrange the columns in tables -environments and thus all Et characters (amp;) to each other. & Kile; tries to make this possible. when pressing Shift; Alt; amp; searches & Kile; after the next tab, add & Kile; some space for the columns position of the current tab.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already a good source code distribution offers, this in & Kile; to include special commands (mostly for & latex;). there are three different modes installed. three of them work according to need and the other two are designed for automatic execution. all of these modes can be set up for different modes of work under Settings Box...</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment is added using the command\\ begin {surrounding} & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {Environment} to an empty line (for text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input will be removed and possibly the default list is removed. on the other hand, the list may also shrink by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions are removed by selecting a command. alternatively, from & Kile; jumps can also be included, so that a jump to these positions is possible by the Edit jumping mark Next jump stamp, and the desired parameters can then be included.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Preferences Kile; set up... Kile; can be done settings to these lists. there may be different list lists for & tex; - and & latex; -Commands as well as wiper books of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for the execution of environments. always a few letters with\\ begin are entered and the calling of the default mode will result in a large list with environment commands. on the other hand, the surroundings are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for the completion of the environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">The command to open the environment is automatically folded and it appears\\ begin {. thereafter, the ambient support can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment is automatically closed again. once you know that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings Box; set up... Kile; can be done settings to these lists. this mode uses the WÃ ¶ rterList of the full-state mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; supports user-defined lists of clipboards, which can be replaced immediately by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings Box... Kile can be set up. as an example, the file example.cwl, in which for example the L =\\ LaTeX entry is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word finishes on the Edit menu, the character L is replaced by the\\ LaTeX string.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Great offices are not helpful for automatic execution. however, it has been established that many more offices are written more than once in a document. thus, & Kile; the complete termination for all previously written books.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the menu Setting... Kile can be disabled. here also the threshold for displaying the default is specified.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The default files can be installed in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / Kile / complete / mode / of the local home folder. mode stands for Abbreviation, dictionary (dictionary) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The dialog graphics display the import of graphics as simple as possible. to the overview of the basics of the graphic formats, the sections should be considered and followed.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well-known as PDF files but offer an excellent basis for changes and new arrangements of pages. if the PDF output is used, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted with ps2pdf into a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">In order to examine the result of the work, the source code must be compiled. all construction tools are grouped in the form of compilation, creating conversion and creating view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source text for viewer such as & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used by pressing Alt; 2. after that, the DVI; file can be viewed in the standard viewer by means of old; 3, by means of old; 4 the DVI; file is converted into a PS file and viewed by means of Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the quick-build command, a viewer is usually called after compiling. if no embedded viewer is used, a new window will be opened each time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project is about the project New Project.... This involves asking the following information for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When defining the filename window, the relative path must be specified from the .kilepr project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The Script function of & Kile; allows to execute ECMAScript code. scripts can be managed by scripts in the vertical bar.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be changed in other versions of & Kile.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in & Kile; a system-wide object (= box) with the following methods:</seg>
<seg id="1862">& latex; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages. & Kile; offers a lot of different help for support of users.</seg>
<seg id="1863">& tetex; and & texlive; supplied with many documents. included are a documentation for the included packages and a further & latex; -reference.</seg>
<seg id="1864">It is not just a description of all programs (but a few important packages are described) but rather is a complete manual for the & latex; commands contain and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific formatting. since this is a very large document, it is divided into three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Due to the amount of documents with which & tetex; / texlive; delivered, finding the right document is not always easy. as possible help provides & tetex; / texlive; the small application texdoc, which contains a database with all documents and boxes; delivered documents and therefor a graphical surface area.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or banners. from & Kile; then only the results are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1867">Double-clicking with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1868">& Kile; is a quelloffener and user-friendly & latex; - / tex; source text editor that can be installed on all systems with an installed & kde; desktop environment. & Kile; is also part of the Fink project, which & Kile; also on & Mac; with OS X installed.</seg>

<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a part, we start with the Edit buts menu. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows you to manage all contained plug-ins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; -element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a location, & quantaplus, this path leads to the search of the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Many people often work on one project in a kind of hierarchical relationship with each other. & quantaplus, supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and serves as a unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders as well as subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can look for himself from the list of team members who he is. this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the button called Setze. the currently selected member (their identity) appears in bold as they are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of your own identity are important with regard to messages and notes. see for further information on annotations.</seg>
<seg id="1938">Besides an overview of their team there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something specific happens. see in for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project, so that later can be seen how much someone was working on or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that enters a file into CVS, as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the event configuration page of the Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog can create, edit and delete events.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email will be sent to the addressee selected in the recipient list. the address can be a team or subproject manager.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Comments are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">To enter comments is simple. it can be either the remark entry from the editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword can be entered in a comment field followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Comments can be sent to a designated member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), whereby nickname is the nickname of the team member is, role played in the project from the following possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are independent of uppercase or lowercase, but spaces around the brackets and the: make the note invalid.</seg>

<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up using Quanta settings... This dialog extends over some pages that are treated one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus, regarding tags including code completion can be changed with this. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / Low Description of tags: large / lower case of automatically inserted tags. normal size / lowercase means the tags are inserted as described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal size / lowercase means the attributes are inserted as described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically include: if attached, for tags for which the closing tag is optional, this immediately after & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags automatically: as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update the start and end tag: if enabled, the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic setting of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding coding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for detecting various types of files. by pressing the Standard button, the default settings can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Default character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening of open files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting is removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD has not been detected. however, this setting is displayed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantaplus, periodically created backup copies so that the document can be recovered from this backup during a power outage or crash. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">Previewing and documentation can be displayed either in the editor pane or in your own view (or the documentation in a tab), which makes it possible to view the documentation, preview and source text at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset window defaults to default when the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by modifying MDI modes and andocking / appending views. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The alert area is used to control the display of warnings by enabling non-polls.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of & VPL. it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL and the source text view in shared mode. see the different modes see.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree representing the figure of the parser nodes in the document can be set in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the area of the mouse click on the structure tree the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Structure Tree pane, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the frequency of updating of the tree during processing and how deep in a change in the structure tree should be automatically opened. empty nodes are the empty spaces in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The range for setting shortcuts (a kind of templates) which is unfolded when editing to larger text. abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s. this means that there can be a valid group for PHP where the CHERE clause means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plugins can be managed. plugins are part-applications from third site, which can be reused by any part-enabled application, the most well-known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Loading a component in the "Read-only" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only read-up parts usually refuse the load if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is enabled, then test & quantaplus, if the entered information is correct. select allows saving of the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus, from version 3.3, troubleshooting has been completely redeveloped. support for the no longer required built-in & PHP; (3) debugger has been adjusted, as well as the support for the DBG debugger. instead of this a debugger plugin concept has been implemented that allows different implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plug-in is available, the support for using & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the Debugger for a project starts with selecting a suitable debugger plug-in in project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plug-in selector, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points are listed, with line numbers and conditions. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action the connection to the debugger, if necessary, is made, or it shares the plugin to listen to debug demands. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened which uses a debugger, so that you don't have to pay attention to it normally.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugger session starts the session. closes the connection to the debugger or ends the listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to debug a debugging requirement. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger issue.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens, while the script is halted, the execution will continue. if the script is started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without informing variables and the current line number. if this happens, while a script is halted, the execution continues. if it happens before a debugger request is given, the execution starts as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The Debugger executes the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The Debugger executes the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and include in the script.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the Debugger to skip the instruction and go to the next one as if the current one is not.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered which should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>

<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS;. & DTEP; s consist of two parts, the tag folder and the toolbars. tag folder includes two file types, the tag folder and the toolbars. tag folder are handy, symbol-oriented ledges of image buttons (above the editing pane) that insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever have.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see for details on conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the descriptionrc; and also toolbars. short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus, for the tag. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without a risk of writing error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folder are nothing but folders. they contain only the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder bears the name of the description language and version, so there. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the tag XML and declares if they are necessary or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better view and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing but an element type about itself otherwise nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of the tag is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for the class class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. specifies the name of the class to which this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">When yes, the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to any other day. (only Family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>

<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus is used to reach the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface name and a method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current day.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that groups the elements of a list. it can only occur once for an attribute description. it is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Sets the attribute text of a tag within a dialog box. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each and lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>

<seg id="2017">All tag XML files must begin with one & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces affect nothing but pay attention to & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; text &gt; replace. this will not cause a leg break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is in the top of the & quantaplus; window to start and check tagXML. to choose another dialog will appear, whose simple instructions will follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check takes place only when loading the Tagged XML files in & quantaplus.</seg>

<seg id="2025">[general] Version = Used 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with settings actions... to be created. click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The key shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking the User Defined button, a shortcut can be assigned; with K1 the current shortcut is removable.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when the action is executed, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited), which change the document or use as input (or parts of the document), are started. examples of & quantaplus, even are the Schnellstart dialog or the various See in... actions for (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way, try to find the script in the following locations: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with PID of the current & quantaplus. if from & quantaplus. if only one instance is running, the text will be unique to the PID #. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & Quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script input of & quantaplus is available; in the input field input can be determined what to send to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected range of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only meaningful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages sent to the standard output. it can be specified, what should be done with the text written on the default output by setting the value to the output field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in any given case, there are not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you plan to use them, enable "Edit tag" dialogue if available so that entering the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let us replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphics Other programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels as default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon does not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the day launch, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually interpreted as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user is signaled that clicking this symbol is a & lt; startgt; -tag will insert in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it still has to be connected with the action. this happens through the menu with settings set actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the saved symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, so there are still some, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus, functions to the toolbar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separators. open the toolbar settings dialog via Settings Toolbar. make sure that the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the item to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror Preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support the grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; -button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar has to be tested by absorbing all the icons in order to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">If new XML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust your file descriptionrc; so that your toolbar (s) will be loaded (will) when a file is opened by the corresponding folder.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus, for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for scripting language or formatting language that you like most. that's why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus. -Repository if someone has already done that for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you have to create the docrc file. we'll leave the first part to you, the second we will treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, for documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the Main Index Top Element = your description for these documentation e.g. & PHP; 4.2 documentation section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.1.html tag 2 = tag2html tag2 = tag2html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag2.html tag3 = tag2.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see the PHP manual now; documentation like this:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Introduction,... Introduction = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except through reason) mdash; but try it out yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; Folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing but pay attention to & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & lt; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The contents section is the area of the docrc file that is used for creating context-sensitive help. for example, when writing one & PHP; scripts to display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by marking the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context menu (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of text-separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as specified in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure they are good and worthy to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -community. they will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the failing resources (DTEP packages, toolbar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners, or anyone else. there is an email-sending menu item such as DTD DTD-Package (DTEP) with email, Toolbar Toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the Scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive from where any other & quantaplus, users can download it. the contributions will be checked and made available only if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication. to make a significant contribution we recommend to sign the resources, for which there is a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of resources is guaranteed for both our team and the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for your private gpg key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the case that you have several keys, you can select one. in the Add New Resource dialog you have to fill in the input fields (URL preview may remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploading from the menus of the DTD DTD package (DTEP), uploading tool bar toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the template and script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, examined & quantaplus. in case of problems, it warns and it can then be cancelled. if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed, a message appears with the statement of the source of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not by & quantaplus. however, the creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files in XML format could be necessary. there is the easier way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the menu DTD Load and Convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description, which should be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folders.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definition line: the string that appears in! Doctype Day, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, & quantaplus, after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand these and to draw full advantage of them, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to bring these concepts closer to them without their understanding & Quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the workspace is divided into three areas: global, local and project related. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus. all that is globally marked is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus. this enables the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use the user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; -patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project. simply put, this is the most constrained size. all elements are stored in the project tree of the project, resulting in the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree view, the index tabs with information and the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click on the tabs with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current document, such as closing, deleting, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or executing CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the editor pane will lead to another context menu with regard to the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), editing the tag under the mouse pointer, or opening the file, when the string is called a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window is the tool bar of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbar buttons is really easy. if you want to insert a simple tag, e.g. & lt; insert into your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. now, you can insert the data for this precisely inserted tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill out different fields in a dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The Baumantura (QIT;) makes it possible to navigate in the information about & quantaplus, to navigate them and roam. in the presentation with tabs are available for files, project, templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage medium can be executed with the contextual menu then displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus, is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website, etc; There are all possibilities open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus. global templates are always available; local templates are available only for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of spin-off in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document to the position of the element. by right-clicking on an element, a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other tree views. with it can change attributes and namespaces quickly. the application system aligned with the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus, from the quantaplus. 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus, two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all faults in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus, scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus, tool bars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the appropriate command. the chocolate side of the toolbars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus is the ability to send a tool bar with EMail. & Quantaplus, sends the tool bar as compressed tar archive over & kmail;. if you receive a tool bar in an email, they can save and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus. this is why autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting with & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 is located in the PATH in front of its bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus, is a web development tool for the KDE desktop. & Quantaplus, was optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While the effort to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus, an independent, extensible markup language editor would? well, this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer confined to pure & HTML; constrained, is & quantaplus, well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML, then & quantaplus, for this purpose, & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the aforementioned claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of Why does anyone else develop? thanks to the & kde; scaffolding is not only this all possible, but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& Quantaplus, enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-painted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task possible.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More detailed documentation is with help: / Quanta (either enter this URL in & konqueror; enter or khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; currently being developed and managed by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, with the oldest record being taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. check the section about templates. if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project default folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converted when inserting from the clipboard there special characters to & HTML; -write, so that they appear correctly and are not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard into & URL; spelling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first and foremost to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Turn on the block selection. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful when your & PHP; -script outputs error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a sort of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expression to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you see the display of scriptions and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Starting and switching of the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus. main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as one changes to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents are grouped in the menu based on the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Search through the project directory for new files that could be there. this enables, for example, to copy graphics files to your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings such as & quantaplus. the project manages the project. in chapter & quantaplus, you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or Project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions must be set by setting actions... are saved. toolbar buttons are stored on toolbar toolbar or you will be asked whether you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. it does not delete it from the disk. if you have not saved the toolbar, you will be asked if you would like to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (maybe the & quantaplus; team for the toolbar to be available in the next publication). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows uploading of toolbar to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download & DTD; which you or someone else has made and convert to & quantaplus. your own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP should be refreshed without the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission is not present in the global KDE folder, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu provides a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar. if the default (HTML;) Toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu item in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current Tag Settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the intelligent insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus, refuses to insert using tool bar when this tag contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plug-ins are listed under the menu items above. click on them.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the kate; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line identifier. very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching may sometimes need time or cause unnice graphics. recommended is the card card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus. 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open sub-window. by selecting an entry, the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Activates the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus. main window.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Set the Editorfensters behavior. in the documentation of & kate you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar, or which add and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the environment of the mouse pointer, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus, is a high-quality product that is freely available and licensed free, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus, development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, because, for example, after completing the project name, the entire directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project. all of these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift; F7 Project Properties Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering the name file, file is filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus. project file. by default it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exam.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the remote host setting, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates for the project are saved. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set rather than the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set rather than the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows you to insert files from the local filesystem into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. for server-side scripts (e.g., PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">If files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be hooked up. if a project is started from scratch, do not hook up.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to good-value.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the files you want by hooks or by removing the checkmark from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded using Project Properties menu in the menu tree in the Profile menu or Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in detail. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders are possible), which are ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to above, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read in more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This means that the desired debugger can be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set with the Options button. in this case, troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles, upload profiles (see in) can be set as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by pointing an own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the Team Configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration window, you can turn on event actions and add, change or delete actions. event actions are executed when a pre-defined event occurs, such as backing up a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus opens; the last project that was opened. you can't influence this behavior at this time.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project or the Project icon Open Project from the toolbar. the Open Dialogue Project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus, closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if & quantaplus. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives you free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders do likewise behave, but the entries are missing open and open with... in context menu, which can be accessed with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here different profiles can be chosen. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Enables removal of the current profile. if only one profile exists, the button will be removed to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">This option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password saved on disk is not in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply exit the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high-loading profiles can be created to upload the project (or parts of the project) to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally, this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk concealed so that it can not be read easily, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. it can give many views in a project, i.e. by simply changing the view various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted from the Project or Project toolbar, accessible via the toolbar's toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has to do the most. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, tool bars in & quantaplus are best designed using the toolbars menu. use and addition differ. adding of toolbars is treated below in the addition of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the icons can be set using context menu (right-click on the toolbar) in which new action, a new toolbar can be created, other actions such as toolbars can be removed, toolbar can be renamed or toolbars are executed, which can be displayed in the dialog where it can be specified, which actions should be visible on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the actions will be removed and action processed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings Toolbars... and set Settings. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeletons, code-cutlets and files for linking. & quantaplus, uses templates basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move, or associate each existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus. supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are included in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more specific documents will be created in appropriate subfolders. some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates. see in for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be included in the documents. you can find everything from a comment about a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl-based. some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for entire websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As Template Save As Local Template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, you will notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As a template save selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can simply be dragged with dragging and dropping onto the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied into a template folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or in the project file and select site template, enter and secure a name for the template. by default, it can be saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very target-oriented approach. you can pre-give headers or footers or dynamically combine with & PHP; design, insert files or link them with them. additionally, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the Subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">In order to specify the behavior of a folder, click on the folder with the right mouse button and select Properties in the Properties menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blended when parental attributes are cracked.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and is suitable for everything except for the regular folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set in such a way, it would basically disable templates in this path unless it is explicitly enabled. if nothing appears, it will probably be in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows previous or copied text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers by copying table content templates into a folder with special headlines / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Additionally you have a context menu (show right mouse button) over a full command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & Source Editor, which can be accessed via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source editor by the VPL; Editor and the second editor splits the editor window into two parts: the Source Editor and the VPL; Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then, you can edit and revert to the source code editor if necessary, in which the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor at a document that contains & PHP, a small green symbol shows the default of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; to edit & PHP; it is still necessary to edit the source code editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that simultaneously the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the VPL; Editor synchronously. pressing F9, this mode is already active, at the touch of a button the active cursor moves from one window to the other, whereby the position in the document is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization gap between the VPL; editor and the source editor can be set up using Quanta settings.... After choosing VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in general, the recommendation is: a small gap for fast calculators and a large span for slow ones.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Let's assume that you want to change the title of the website, so editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the VPL; Editor is also called as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; editor. this is used to reduce the manual encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows to change the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating the appearance of pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the meta elements. editing CSS rules is not currently supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style sheet by pressing the file-open button and selecting the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursor is as in a word processor, by moving the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves strange. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleting by means of a button or removal key.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags is done in the same way via the toolbar, as in the source editor. note that the insertion of tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed, e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted, surrounded with text, any other armature tag must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbar functions such as the Tables Assistant or the Listen Assistant are disabled. they will work later in the & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists must be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the investigation of style sheets. unlike other style sheets, the search for certain elements is possible and execution of style sheets can be tracked.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To successfully compile and install xsldbg; still need libxslt, libexslt and libxml libraries that are already present at a typical installation of & kde.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparing. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was a lot of conflicts during merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me showed only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no clue to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. bringing these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">So that was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, any number of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">3-way merge is also fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. the merge editor under the Differences windows enables resolving conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge the complete folder. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and resists the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently need to check codes, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visibly. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but are in different folders, you can ease the typing by simply typing the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diffuser Folder 2 kdiff3 Folder 2 -o Destner2 Share folder kdiff3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 -o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog allows manual typing of file names, selecting the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog recognizes your selection and displays them again next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences is performed with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">With the Folder button... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparing and / or merging of folders is initiated. if a file is selected for A, however, a folder will be used for B and C, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the other two folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When intercepting is enabled, the input field is active and can be edited. however, it is not absolutely necessary to specify an output file immediately. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in the opening dialog you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it drop over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes, a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively large expense. you would need to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you cannot remove anything from & kdiff3. only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and pasting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data might be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Each info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse over the line for a while. then a small help window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed using the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, you can see the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. that's in the next section (merging) good to see.</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. with some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line breaks are activated, the line is dotted with broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the wording appearing:, the filename and [changes] if you have processed the result. usually, it already contains text by automatic merge, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is deactivated!!! (use the jumps to the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the row will be marked in all windows and the first row of the group will be displayed. (this will also make a jump of the position in the windows where the start of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will then be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merge or by manual editing; this is only a placeholder in the case that you change your mind and perhaps again choose another source. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marking that you may copy and paste elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if the options are ignored when selecting the sources, ignoring Ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the image sequence and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side on, page beginning, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the output window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. using the insertion button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge and editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-picture), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture outwards / Ctrl-picture Abforward) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict. therefore, there must be a distinction between resolved and unresolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). there is also the option Automatically Copy. if this is enabled, whatever you mark will be automatically copied to the clipboard and the manual copying is omitted. however, be careful with this option because you could overwrite the contents of the clipboard accidentally.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix variants use a line feed character\, and Win32-based systems use cart return + line feed\\ r\. KAB3 does not maintain the line-ends of the source files, so you should use & kdiff3; also do not use binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically during loading and restored at the next start. (Menu Settings - &gt; KAB3 Set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences are displayed in italics. if the selected script does not support this display, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be displayed straight. on these systems, the Preferences button automatically adjusts an unjust colour.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when the Tab key is pressed. otherwise, a tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press Enter or Return, the recurrence of the previous line will be used automatically for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is checked, every selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer to save. the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3; first to find all completely identical rows in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. in this step, white characters will not be ignored. even when merging, white characters will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of a line, others only store a line feed '\'. if this option is checked, carriage return signs could be made visible, however like a white mark. while merging, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensely for even smaller differences. the option is enabled by default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic sequential mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict is progressed.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically dissolves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source. (default is manual selection.) That's useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you need this only from time to time, then use the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ignoring numbers or ignoring C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter to scan folders and execute a merge. see for details under Documentation to Comparison and Merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, then the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current program. you must & kdiff3; quit and restart to make the change active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally over the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if enabled, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the encoding fields for coding a short notice of what the local encoding is. (this cannot be changed here and has an informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually configurable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding to use for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the default command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn on this to suppress highlighting of changes in white characters in text or view columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded Excel column. but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files. by selecting A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C will be shown next to the normal yet another policing column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you'd like to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply fill out the less important windows. (this option is in the Windows menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arranges the comparison window next to each other or above. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the Windows menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes consider the differences and then unexpectedly decide to merge the files. current file merging in the merge menu works even if you only compare two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will first hand it to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your needs. you can use this function e.g. to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first given to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this pre-processing command. the output of the command is used only for line offset. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases, sed or perl are sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this command-command for line reconciliation to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is a graulary expression that matches any string and in this context refers to the found text in the first clamps. the\\ U converts the found text into capital letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords for inserting automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). all of them follow the same pattern $keyword generated text $. so, a pre-processing command for line reconciliation is needed. the\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of another pre-processing command for line reconciliation. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every line between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so basically deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at a time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like e.g perl -p -e's / regexp / replace / SCHALTER 'However, perl needs some details different. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be retained for displaying and merging. other operations only change the data that the line-off algorithm looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you are using a normal preprocessor, the line scanning preprocessor will see the output of the normal Preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The pre-processor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally fail to notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit a lot of files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folder recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge, you can customize the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and displays the simulated changes without actually carrying out it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the File dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 will be used as a base. if no destination folder was specified, & kdiff3 will be used as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not merging. to start merging, you have to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While scanning the folders, a small message window informs you about the current progress. if you abort the scan of the folders, only the files that have been compared until then are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folders is finished, & kdiff3 shows a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is normally folded up. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / -, or double-clicking on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge operation cannot be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this type again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical. then folders also have the same color. for folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow will be yellow and later when it is old, red becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for syncing is active if only two folders and no explicit destination folder were specified and if the option synchronize dirs. then select & kdiff3; select the necessary action so that both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees only B as the visible file name; copied directly after merging & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and the option to select a new file instead of merge (unsafe), then examine & kdiff3; the date of the files and hits the newer file for copying. if the files are different but the date is identical. if such errors are not fixed, the merge of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging, one file will be executed after the other. you will see the status column finished when the merge succeeds, and accordingly other messages if something unexpected happened. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the file comparison method is selected for full analysis in the setup dialog, KDiff3 will display other columns. these contain the number of unresolved, resolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the coupling actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not have a destination folder, then C will be used as the target in the Three-Folder Merge mode, B will be selected as the target for two folder merging, A and / or B will be used when syncing.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check if all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that might skip certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select Start / Continue Directory Access / Continue in the Folder menu or press F7 (the shortcut key). to perform just the current entry: select Action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid merge actions, a message appears that points to the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box will appear with the options performing, simulating and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select Restarting / Continue Directory Access / continue or press F7. if you have not yet saved, a corresponding dialog will appear. then, & kdiff3 will continue its work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; encountered a mistake, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you fix the cause of the problem. if you continue merging (F7 key), & kdiff3; you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in other way before proceeding with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If a number of entries have been merged individually, you notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and will not merge them when they later merge. even if the merge operation has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered finished. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Set up menu Settings - &gt; KAB3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the elemental tree. multiple patterns can be entered. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders do not have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elemental tree. it can be entered more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elemental tree. it can be entered more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignore files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder can be set to a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hidden attribute. in other file systems, a previous point is marked as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the elemental tree or not. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">For links to files: if the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">For links to folders: if the option is disabled, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the links will be treated like normal folders and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3) will not check for possible recurrences. (note that a link to a folder containing a link to itself would result in a continuous loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistic columns. (the number of resolved, unsolved, non- white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and essentially slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it might be faster to compare only the modification date and file size. however, this speed advantage costs you a certain amount of security. please use caution. this option is switched off by default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidentiality of the modification date. there is no real comparison. the files will be regarded as identical if they are equal. for example, this can be useful when copying the modification date. please use caution. this option is switched off by default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activate the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected so that both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging the later file will be proposed as an action. (this is considered unsafe because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified too. you should check this in any case.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version is renamed and gets the extension .orig. If an old backup file with the .orig extension is already existing, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merge of individual files, not only the merging of entire folders. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder merging view is visible during the merge of individual files; you can shift the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want, you can switch off the option directory and text window in the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory and text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Most likely you prefer to easily compare a file by double-clicking. however, in the directory menu there is also a corresponding menu entry. you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merging. once you save the result, the status will be set to the filename and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you read the directory again: directory -Menu: reenter</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KAB3 uses this to read files and folders. this way you can specify files and folders to open on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. you should consider a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contained. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, Space &gt; &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link shows a file or folder. then a file will always be accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modification dates. therefore, permissions or modification dates deviate from the original. (note the option Trust of Size.) (This is possible only for local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently as a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always launches the built-in difference viewer. to start KAB3, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In KDE3 Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally, & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is applied as a part, it takes & kdiff3; then declines & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then, & kdiff3; the patch program will start to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In Konqueror, you can click on a patch file and select From the ContextMenu Preview in - KDiffuser Part. note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is not reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; executed as part, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the play mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">There are already tools called KDiff and KAB2 (now the name KAB2). in addition, the name KAB3 already indicates that it can merge as the diff3 program from the Diff Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script to KDE. in default, configure installed in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines will first be treated as identically; but if only one non-white character is different, the line will not be treated as identically. iF similar lines are more often to each other, this is more often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor noticises any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. it is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the A / B / C button. however, this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this has been too big so far. you can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to edit larger quantities of text, a different editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly healed; no src turns; appeared and the text cannot be extinguished. what does that mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use a different editor for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3, you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how you can use KAB3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the latest changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install; on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir is the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake uses, you should have no problems with compiling. if you still encounter difficulties, please report on the & kde; mailing lists of them.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift) copied to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift) insert the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position or replace the current marker.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and consequently not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, after changes to these options, you will need to re-read the folder with the Update function.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This will also cause identical files to be copied to the destination folder while merging. if the destination folder does not already contain those files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be modified in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the lettering A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines will be appended from the corresponding window to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed by clicking on the button.</seg>

<seg id="2483">The area around the mouse pointer looks like a moving magnifier. alternatively, you can set up a selected screen area in the magnifier window (selection window mode) or the surroundings of the mouse-pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; on the left side of the screen).</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse pointer persists on the same spot. it is meant to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) Syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain. furthermore, it can emulate the dragging with the mouse. this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helping so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, even by simply moving the mouse, pain may be caused. if you suffer from pain that is related to your computer's use, you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even though & kmousetool, helps to avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click away as soon as you stop the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">The smart move is enabled, power & kmousetool; pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can drag the dragging with pressed mouse button. the intelligent shifting requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This dwell time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click navigates.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligentes Move is enabled, the shooting time (1 / 10 s) is activated. here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing down the mouse button wait, before releasing the mouse button again, if there is no moving of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking through mouse shift. if this function is enabled, a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these movements will be started in the file $KDEHOME / share / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the response time. to do this, go to the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the General tab. there is a slider adjusting sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shorten response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">When this setting is selected, & kmousetool; at every start of & kde; started. this function is currently only available in & kde; please consult the respective documentation for GNOME or other window environments to find out how to start a program there automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the stand after the last application is pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the smart move should be switched off at first. if you have become accustomed to the automatic mouse click, you can later push the smart postpone.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First you should be aware at which places a mouse-click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not display a link doesn't lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. that's usually pretty simple. the trick is that you will not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to remove the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse is different from the mouse, but it should be clear when you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you'd have to see the reels. these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can easily scrape the dirt and dirt with a flat blade or fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you are using smart postpone in this case, it means that & kmousetool means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer stop by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you have a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try and kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and puts the cursor somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want it. however, you can use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to use a keystroke. this way, an accidental moving of mouse clicks can cause undesired reactions. secure zones for the mouse-pointer are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbar and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with smart postpone, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very likely to mark text, copy it to the clipboard and insert it again or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. here are some advice about it:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using it & kmousetool; instead, use a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. the mouse button pushes a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the shift time starts when smart postpone. later, you can use the smart move even without the audible mouse click. but this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool, the XTest extension for & X Window must be installed. this should be the case on most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker and these are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; pressed the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer persists. this program was developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and causing pain to be afflicted.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured in such a way that a drag action begins before the mouse button is released. in this way, dragging and dragging can be done with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced features of & ktts;. for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters, text is edited before being sent to the speech-talk program. they are useful for improving pronunciation to replace wrongly spoken words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain flaws of voice synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand how filters work, it is important to know how the "speech-patcher" program works with a text. & ktops; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other applications and stops these jobs. if the output of the screen readers is read, the retained orders will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor gets too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will be resumed after issuing the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next highest priority. a message breaks normal text. & mouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; read a long text on a web page, you can welcome to & kde; notifications are also messages. read more.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order that you send from the box is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queue, except for the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktt; just one such read, this issue will be stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal alerts, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently, there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can still be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String replaced parts replace parts of a text by other text. you can specify the parts to be replaced either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; is supplied with predefined string placeable filters, which enable the replacement of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for re-formatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better comprehensible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converters use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format to another format. within the scope of delivery of & ktts; are some XSLT files for the translation of & XHTML; contained in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With Speaker selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktts; send to a speaker. for example, if you have a female voice on the speaker map speaker, you can read text from KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules to which it is applied to a speech output. if the filter detects that its rules do not apply, it continues the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; -Notification is sent to & ktts; it is processed by all activated filters arranged on the bottom of the page. processing by the filters is carried out in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are turned down from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and the following setup dialogs are displayed below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting up string translation filters you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern. if these patterns are found in the text, then the text will be exchanged for the associated substitute text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it must only be distinguished from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column. the list is executed from top to bottom in the order shown.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. download a list from a file that appends the entries from the file to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter is applied only if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here. click on the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you press the & Ctrl; button at the mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID of running programs is available with the program qdbus;. the & dbus; -numbers must be omitted. if for example, & qdbus; the application id copy-3432 shows, you are only allowed to type in.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replace filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filter if they agree. if all input fields are empty, the filter will be applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string replace filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. so the words must be limited on both sides by delimiters.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual, you will find no guide to write regular expressions. but if you have the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions can be found in the package kdeux.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XML; Transformer translate & XML; using XSLT files from a format to a different format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such conversions. however, it can only be applied to well-formed XML. the xsltproc utility must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the xsltproc program. if xsltproc is available via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is enough.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the Speaker selection filter you can send text to a specific speaker, which is set up on the card board speaker, or to a speaker with specific features. for example, you can specify that texts should be read by kmail from a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; pass a text to the filter, it looks for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected on the basis of the speaker properties, which dictates the program, which sends the text to & ktts; sends, and the characteristics of the speakers created on the card board. with the speaker selection filter, you can override the selected speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression. if it is installed on your system the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can enter it by clicking on the button to get help in entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve faster processing, try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the characteristics of the speaker you want. if the text fulfills the filter conditions shown above, the speaker will be selected to best meet the desired requirements. click the button on the right to display the Speaking Selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your voice settings or delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The Speaker selection filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filter if applicable. you must enter at least one condition.</seg>

<seg id="2675">KTTS works with any speech synthesizer that can be started on the command line in a & console.</seg>
<seg id="2676">The list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or outdated. therefore, consult the description of the synthesizer to the supported languages. look also on the website of ktts;, after information that is not yet included in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The "speech-Dispatcher" program uses an adaptable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to expand & tts; for the use of another synthesizer, contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc User Language program is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filter, but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the command apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile and desktt; you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or later) including the cdelibs packages and the development files for the "speech-patcher" program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktts, or downloaded from the source code archive or downloaded the tarball that is currently created every night, install and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before using your speech synthesizer, check first if speech-dispatcher is working properly with your speech synthesizer. to do this, you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktops; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of speech. the program kttmsgris to be developed so that the setup of speech-dispatcher is possible directly and the script spd-conf is no longer required.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is divided into individual sentences. the user can return propositional or paragraph style, repeat, pause or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application passes text on & ktts, it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output. for example, if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female, it will be used, otherwise the best matching speaker is selected automatically. if you want to learn more about how to select a speaker, look in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">When you click Add to add a speaker to the list or click Edit in order to insert a speaker into the list or click Edit, the box Map Setup will be displayed. as an example, the module for Festival Interactive is shown below. details on the modules can be found under.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to festival is included in PATH, you just have to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the encoding for text that is passed to the festival. in the case of voices that are commuted to the festival, this setting is done automatically. generally, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders, you adjust volume, speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you can't select some controls and show this gray, the voice you selected does not allow these settings to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like multi-syn voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD, so that the first set is synthesized more quickly (with greater memory consumption).</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or forget to click Apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window kttsmgr will be displayed at the start of the program window. otherwise, only the kttsmgr can be seen in the system section after the start, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to view the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and kttsmgr doesn't run yet, it will appear in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text. this gives you the option to stop reading or otherwise control it.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all orders are listed in queue, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sentences and the currently processed proposition. the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column on the card board speaker.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional filters (SDB filters). SBDs subdivide the text into single phrases. this way, you can start or stop the first set more quickly, since only the first set does not have to be synthesized, even if the speech synthesizer does not support this directly.</seg>

<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker selection by trying out. switch on the speaker selection and enter text to read. switch on the box selection, change some features and check how the speaker selection changes. of course, you need to have more than one speaker installed, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then start faster with the reading, since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can pause or abort text orders on the card board, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set-level detection filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Propositional Identification Filters compare text with a regular expression for propositional phrases and insert a tab character (decimal code 8) at the set limits (tabs are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the default set-level detection filter retains the punctuation.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters will never be applied to & kde; messages (knotify), alerts, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal sentence filtering filter from default, you can insert it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card box choice you can override the speaker settings for the application. the card box will be displayed when</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the default speaker (the top one on the card reader). in other words: no speaker features are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker with all characteristics of an equipped speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & ktt; select this speaker. otherwise, select the speaker that matches the originally set properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the speaker you want. if this property does not play a part, do not give anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property should have priority over other properties. you can also set multiple markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since language is a critical factor in the output of output, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this feature. the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is before, if you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than that posted in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To delete all the properties in the range of speakers that corresponds best to the following, click on the Standard Speaker button and then click on the speaker that best meets the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 stands for the last word order in the queue. you can also specify an order number. (no order number is required to enter 0).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr immediately crashes when it is started. I have compiled Debug support, but I don't get back tracking.</seg>

<seg id="2747">The audio output over ALSA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application. when I receive a text order, it freezes & ktops; one. on the & Console; appears a message stating: unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, there is a problem that conflicts occur with ALSA, which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. for possible solutions please visit the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I loaded an additional voice for festival from the internet. I installed it and can use it in festival, but kttsmgr doesn't show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / vocal / vocal. as a guide, you can use the other entries. if that is successful, please send a patch along with the URL; on which you have found the voice, to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the Audio Card Audio there is a setting speed. for this to work, the program must be installed sox and be discoverable by the environment variable PATH. some synthesizers such as Festival Interactive also offer a setting for speed on the card for speaking device. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for speaking speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSML.) Enable either the filter for converting & HTML; according to & XML; (see) or, if you are very bold, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML conversion filter, and set up the talk speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't make it possible for websites to be read with a female voice. I have set up a female festival orator, but & ktams; read the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95, the Tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so that festival does not produce errors, the xsl file rejects the GENDER tags for converting SSML. the same goes for the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a own string repair filter and now I can proceed in & ktt; no more set-up or return. on the tab. orders will be displayed, the job consists only of one sentence. what do I do wrong?</seg>

<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts during the audio output. if your system also counts, you can't simultaneously play music and read a text. & ktit; freezes if you hold a text order and then start another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of ALSA (dmix).</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKode does not support any real breaks. if you hold a text order in & ktt, the current set is still read.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program sox is used for the general setting of the talk speed, but is otherwise not necessary. Debian users can install sox with the command apt-get install sox. the program is already included on most & Linux; -CDs already.</seg>

<seg id="2763">In & kde; 4, the module & arts; probably removed or at least only created on request.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for voice synthesizers are created by default. some of them have a running time dependency of non-free software.

<seg id="2768">Before using the synthesizer, first check if your voice synthesizer works properly. follow the instructions that you have received with the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good, and several voices and languages are supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You must install at least one language. help is provided in the instructions provided with Festival. if you want to read websites, you must install the (male UK) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you have to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice presupposes Festival 1.95 beta or later. the voice is still in an early stage of development. unpack the software in the festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you must enter the voice MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding as for example koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the & Linux distributions. therefore search the festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option must be set to an 8-bit Cyrillic like koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the & MBROLA; Synthesizer. then, Festival takes over the lexical analysis and MBROLA; generated from it the audio output. the & MBROLA; -program and the & MBROLA; -voices can be downloaded from</seg>

<seg id="2797">It is best to use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file (wav) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device</seg>
<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; to manage network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & controlcenter; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated interface. the & controlcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; the ranges of & knetwork.conf; create a simple interface for the user:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings will be displayed at the & kcontrolcenter; the module network settings (knetwork.conf;) can be started by selecting the kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network Network Setting in & KMenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetwork.conf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to enable & knetwork.conf; the device at all shows and allows setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed and set up while installing & Linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded when the option Network Setting is selected at the & kcontrolcenter; index. when starting the module network settings, this attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be identified, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which best meets the distribution and release status. by marking the setting non-re-questions, the definition can be made permanently. at the next start of the network settings then this selection will be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is possible only in system management mode. previously, all options are shown in grey, meaning the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. enter the system management mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system administration mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The Network interfaces tab is used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the tab Network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button of the button... to be edited in the Device Dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to open the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">Automatic mode selects TCP / IP settings from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out simultaneously with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server will send all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start, so no further setting is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system, can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the option manual, the TCP / IP configuration can be done without DHCP or BOOTP. in the IP address input field, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the netmask input field, the subnet mask must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this option is selected, the system initializes the network interface while booting. if initialization is undesirable, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are shown as the characteristics of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked if the desired address is already in use.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. switching off an outdated network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be turned on or off depending on the need. turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and deactivating the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the host's IP address in the local subnet that communicates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain extension by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine is calling http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS records this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution calculator allows for easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS records can be rearranged by selecting an entry or downgrading or downgrading in the list with buttons Hinauf or Heron in priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking on the Add button... from the Batch Calculator group to the name resolution, a DNS server can be added. the Add Name Server dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to the name resolution, select one entry and then click the Edit... button is displayed in the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of names known by name describes hostname-to-IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used for booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list includes some well-known hosts some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses support. this version of IP still in the test will replace version 4 in future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the familiar computer and click Add.... The New Alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the well-known host and click the Add button. if the known host has several alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a particular known machine from the list and select Edit.... The dialog Default Calculator will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the Network Settings module are not effective immediately in the system. to enable the changes, you need to set the following command in a & Console.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetwork.conf; is http: / / knetwork.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is sufficient if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the pre-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with a graphical interface like kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended to experienced users only. however, it is not difficult to compile your network.conf. the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information is given about basic network technology, in the second section all of & knetworkconf; modifiable configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this attachment, only basic information about the integration of the PC is mediated into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never found widespread use. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future, which is why this description is currently concentrating on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing the IP address of a network interface. in other networks, at & eg; workplace the network administrator is the contact point, which is a valid IP address or, if available, can be used DHCP. in any case, the IP address cannot be simply chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a particular area reserved specifically for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the range is large enough for networks up to 250 machines.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = your own computer). the default route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to a so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part are the configuration files that are affected by & knetwork.conf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections so it will not be surprised if there is any other content than specified in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is reassorted by the scripts in SuSE. another stand than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2886">Alternatively, you can also right-click on the variable and select Enabled. make sure the name and value of the variables are displayed correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2887">If all tasks and environment variables have been entered or modified, you still need to save the crontab. to do so, select File Save menu item.</seg>
<seg id="2888">Alternatively you can press Ctrl; S. changes or additions to tasks or variables become active only then.</seg>
<seg id="2889">It appears the standard kde; printing dialog. if you choose to fold out, you will see there are two additional & kcron; -specific options in the printing dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Print the crontab of all users on the system. this option is only accessible to users who have advanced permissions.</seg>
<seg id="2891">Cron, for example, Vixie-cron. & kcron; uses the command crontab to change the time schedules of the users.</seg>
<seg id="2892">A POSIX conformes & UNIX, for example with glibc. & kcron; uses standard commands from & UNIX; to learn time and date.</seg>
<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar, which additionally offered the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective packing.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be mounted by & kdat. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; Put the tape back and reads the pre-tensioning information of the tape. recognize & kdat; don't recognize the pre-tensioner on the tape, you'll be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & kdat; the pre-cursor, searches it for the right index on your disk. if this cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the icon will change for the tape drive to indicate that the tape was mounted. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched for the tape by folding the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; indicates through a change of the symbol to the band that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be kicked out without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band can be used by & kdat, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A tape type must be formatted before you can use it for saving data. this procedure does not conform to formatting at & kdat; this procedure does not conform to formatting at & kdat. if your tape drive requires that a tape can be formatted before use, it must be formatted before using the tape from & kdat. floppy disks usually do not require formatting the tape, DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacitance drives & kdat, proceed with the format of the tape. all data on the tape are lost! after completing the formatting process the tape is automatically included and is ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you must select the files you want to backup, which can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only backup this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a check box. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select Save In the Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been initiated, the Settings dialog opens. in this dialog you can again check the selected files and change the backup settings.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the Backup dialog will appear. the dialog will show the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder is checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a check box. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click in one of the archives and select Insert menu item....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test process has been started, the dialog will appear for checking. in this dialog you can check your selection once more and change the working folder for verification.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the verification settings, the dialog pops up. this dialog displays the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before rebuilding, the files to be recovered must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive entry. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a check box. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore...</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the Preferences dialog will appear. in this dialog you can check your selection once more and change the restore job folder.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Once you have confirmed the restore settings dialog, the Restore dialog will appear. this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recreate the band index file using the band content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files located therein will be backed up on the same file system as the folder. folders that lie on other file systems can be placed separately under backup files. each entry is viewed from tar regardless of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file from tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the Knuckles files & gt; & lt; files were not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must point to the non-rewinding variant of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmits & dat; before the tape is involved, the command mt load is loaded onto the drive. on some drives this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, you try to lock the tape. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, when mounting & kdat, the band will be kicked off automatically. do not use this option for Floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is turned on, you will try to change the hardware block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must notify & dat; in any case you need to tell the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat, a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where the name is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time the tape has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup band. this icon is only active when a tape is mounted.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files. moreover, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access, for example, on information about problems appearing on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system bases the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog enables experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, try to provide some advanced features which can be filtered and evaluated using the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. this includes:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshots, & ksystemlog; functions are available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystemlog; first the main protocol file of the system - the system log - will open. if this is not shown to you, and it opens up instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; most likely do not start with system administrator privileges. the protocol files usually do not have permission to read under Linux in the / var / log folder for normal users.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criteria or character strings. the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically so that only log lines will be displayed to fit the selected filter. in the default setting, the selection field contains the All. then, a record line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">Of course, you can also select another entry. for example, in the log file system log, select the process column, and in addition, in the log file system log, select the process name, and write in the filterstrip the name of a process, so it will show you & ksystemlog; all log lines sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of the stage errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color as the protocol lines of the level critic. the colored representation of protocol lines can be turned off setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain processes (e.g. in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can, for example, be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can check the Add to new lines button in the main window context menu to display all new log lines added.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows you to display multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own web page on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. There you can find further information about the supply sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archives: ksystemlog; im & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and named in the following as well) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">System V Init is rapidly becoming standard for the control of the program start when starting the system in the & Linux; this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary is below / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and re-formatting. the Linux kernel looks first under / etc after an init file. therefore, you must make sure that the old init was removed from there, if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs also from the BSD init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for each system service that you want to start when you run the system or switch to another round level. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file even if you don't have much use for it. you can also get a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to execute something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init at different places after the program init and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runtime is in / etc / inittab. you should see in the initial area a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably state that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have messed up, then you can fix it by restarting the system and doing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written so that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line like this:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will be invoked with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be invoked with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server run level that runs only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; in addition, I could also have a user-run level, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; using a mouse or other pointing device is simple to not say trivial: just drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six runtime levels to launch it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runmodes or modify the position within a level by dragging it somewhere else. the entry will be removed from its original runtime (or its position). this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the field of disposable system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you drag them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new level, you must explicitly choose Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry existed previously in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is currently no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tab key to activate the different work ranges (Available System Services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another round level, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and paste it into the desired runtime with insert (using Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the sorting number or the name of an entry, press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of loss of data, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. defaults are retrieved from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard runtime levels, and now the machine is constantly running. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt line linux single and press the input key to start in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runtime to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; running under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services can be started in these distributions simplifies the configuration of the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to a standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check that all configuration files are available that are needed by the respective system service (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply end without a message if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly arranged.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The Importance of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the runtime to be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter customization of & kuser.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save them. you can either use the corresponding toolbar icon or the Save In the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">The main window consists of two card cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. the dialog appears for the user / group properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings. only if you have enabled space restrictions (quota) for users, a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings. other cards may appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD-Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card password management board appears if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD-Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card box only appears if there is at least one built-in filesystem space limitation (quota) activated and initialized (identifiable at the file quota user / quota.group on the filesystem). here, parameters can be changed for each user, with the space limitations provided in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected using the File System field with space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The management board groups inform about the group affiliations of the selected user. the default group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary group. furthermore, the user can become a member of other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Properties dialog box contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group will work analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO System Manager, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot from the default operating system, add the default operating system, remove, change operating systems, remove, change and more.</seg>
