although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and practiced its sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can L@@ etter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous plot of an oil @-@ mag@@ n@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to show his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free after Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if it is absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona was only hei@@ gh@@ tened by my admir@@ ation for the US .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had written a very sham@@ eful love letter about his size .
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me , as he is dealing with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
with his opinion he never stops behind the mountain , as you say so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague puts it , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can prim@@ aries was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever achieved .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme that receives people from all over the world , a deeply beli@@ ever person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past .
Tr@@ um@@ ps , too , did not agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current publisher of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who has been fighting the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Le@@ aks , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values represented by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump made his way to nom@@ inate Republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception to the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , gave the pres@@ idency to a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people have voted for dr@@ unk@@ enness , because they either shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
it is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and in@@ capable of understanding those who act and think differently .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom know , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to regain control of a country that disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who commented on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t upon those who look different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( note D. Ü ) : as much as &quot; the revol@@ t of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; word play from white in all@@ usion to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ plas@@ h , which means so much as the great Van Jones , has exactly killed what America has done so splen@@ did@@ ly .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have , America is welcome everyone .
for this country chose as its president twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ man whose history as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
however , with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , a huge part of the white American promises this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm , they say .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , that is not your America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was rec@@ tified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country for which his son fell , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the news .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find a place in this new America .
and it breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love of music by rub@@ b@@ ish .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca have in common with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ an town of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
that the music played in both places , not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , just 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world famous cuisine .
for some years La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding it with its musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its abuse of drugs and ban@@ anas .
but this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and thus offered a rare hope for hope .
the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , writes the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing and with gle@@ aming eyes and play in the bu@@ zz you learn day by day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga to play .
music from Wa@@ ste
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments made up of local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments under the leadership of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all made of rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music , as well as music from the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article from the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , rec@@ alls the beginning time :
first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something he had never seen before : a violin made from waste .
today there is an entire orchestra playing on instruments made of re@@ processed material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary named &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic waste dump ) character@@ ises the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of tr@@ ash every year .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like men in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmony follows the orchestra with its inspiring performance from tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team@@ work can effectively fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the joint use of content .
in West Africa at that time it was known that this ship had already used illegal fishing in the Liber@@ ian waters before it sought the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were upset and reluc@@ tant to welcome a criminal of this type on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give it a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that just refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ members Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan F@@ ish@@ eries Authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : he was unable to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay $ 2 million in Liberia , because of pil@@ lage of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which inter@@ sec@@ ts criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 launched by the N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that the prime minister had driven out of their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and help each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is by definition un@@ regulated : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , can harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also through the sn@@ ail stamp , with which information circul@@ ated between individual countries , the actions happen nowadays in real time , trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , for example , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , suspi@@ cious running routes can be discovered - such as suggest@@ ing that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such tests can show whether the involved vessels have a fishing license where they were on the way and possibly also whether they have a criminal .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse acceptance of such ships in their ports based on this information , meaning that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile any more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm advoc@@ ating for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the previously mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue , which the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i lose every year due to illegal fishing , which enter into East African waters .
East @-@ Africa has one of the most productive tuna @-@ fish@@ eries , therefore the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among them also these illegal fishing fishermen .
their practices include , among other things , actions such as sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit license papers , indication of fan@@ ta@@ sies , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an un@@ interrupted control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t run my harbor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; and that is exactly what F@@ ISH @-@ i tries to close . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to now the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found fle@@ eing ships .
due to his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over great distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that is constantly being developed helps to track down the illegal ships that like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishing boats use very clever techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , head analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fisher@@ y data and provides technical support with F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , for example , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal @-@ acting ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence this un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
Sky@@ Truth has recently opened Global Fishing Watch &apos;s Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the ocean protection organization Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data and displays the position of each tracking vessel around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities don &apos;t only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships that had been f@@ ished without a license and had little consequences , now know they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i are now seeing a 33 % increase in fishing turnover , since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow nets where they were banned .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 six countries joined together , to the West Africa Task Force so called West Africa Task Force . they are also fighting illegal fishing according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; With certainty , the aim is to let even more such initiatives and structures arise in other regions , &quot; states Cop@@ eland .
recently F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s most recent member country Somalia has been able to announce its first great triumph : in October , there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag . and not only was the ship on the way without a license , and were used tow@@ ing nets that are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also im@@ bu@@ ed into forbidden waters reserved for fish@@ ers from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the conduct of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong signal that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative working method for protecting the oceans actually works across the world ocean . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , The New York Times and The Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the goal of &quot; rec@@ ap@@ turing the country &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to be a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government rejected the opposition &apos;s request for a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness by gathering on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezu@@ el@@ an ( for example : the recovery of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them .
the debate will also be held in other parts of the country , including in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central north of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and Isla Margar@@ ita in the state Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is wor@@ sen@@ ing continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition have seen the chance of a fundamental change in the opening of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately blocking a re @-@ election was blocked by official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the government decision :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence rate is one of the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated to be 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum was considered to be the only way to give the country the chance to rec@@ ap@@ ture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or briefly MU@@ D ( for example : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , called on the proceedings against President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . &quot; in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike on the following day and a march to Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government , should continue to pers@@ ist .
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
it &apos;s as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3 all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the context of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures of the mar@@ ches , published in real time , testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also clas@@ hes with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most commonly shared images shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wilt thou kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter images that tell of disputes , as well as reports of oppression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
particularly large waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statements in front of the police and armed pro@@ pon@@ ents of the government .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ staat T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts because otherwise one could see something that many national Gu@@ ards do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic is already making the round that reflects the amount of suppression per day :
thus the dictatorship oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for a term of office - this has now been proved in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ bis@@ cuit &apos;s Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the signatures have been fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your exercise !
on the road !
others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that , from their point of view , under@@ took little against the devastating economic crisis and preferred to refrain from breaking critical voices :
they took us so much - but also fear !
mar@@ ches grow more and more in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an town of Cór@@ doba .
as an adult , Qui@@ j@@ ano now spoke against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Cór@@ doba .
in the trial which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military installations at the Pr@@ ison of La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept his family secret .
in the situation at that time , I believed that was al@@ right .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child at the age of 15 , you don &apos;t notice that you are manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time , I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis was no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ maid . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the intelligence department 141 in the prison La Per@@ la from 1976 to 1978 .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor , who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testified before a Federal Constitutional Court against his own father .
his story shows the great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose for himself a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there , I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
all called him K@@ ent .
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you &apos;re an as@@ sh@@ ole , you &apos;ve been friends with one of the ERP .
just be careful not to kidn@@ ap you one day and I have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , a revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of Argentina &apos;s revolutionary workers &quot; party .
that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had educated me .
at the military base I had to wipe out papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all sorts of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

&apos;@@ There the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
at first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small box wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump of silver .
that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were put down and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured there .
I pe@@ ed inside and saw a couch being tor@@ tured on humans .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they fastened it to one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person that was tied up there .
they un@@ le@@ ashed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ laid him with water and drove him a load of 220 volts to the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was aw@@ ful ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied up with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were eye @-@ binding .
he spoke to &quot; Chu@@ bi , &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused of trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked human beings were lying down with the face - all were bound hand and foot .
near the entrance , people watched sil@@ ently on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed I was seeing the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you look like as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , there were some rooms designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to survivors , the Zi@@ vi@@ list Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial , was sentenced to death by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the Memorial Site of La Per@@ la , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way in which the kidn@@ apped came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be laid .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought home all kinds of stolen stuff .
at that time at age I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military later , - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs that one takes away from an enemy that has been fought .

but if you go into a house and steal the fridge , the turn@@ table , clothes , paintings , money ... then this is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , was able to participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You who steal cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded in rage , struck me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , then I will find you and move you by yourself .
we don &apos;t need anyone else !
so was my father .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
when I testified in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a roll @-@ neck jum@@ per made of wool . I had both my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay me on what they wanted .
I was there anyway to say .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , so , during the dictatorship , you executed people . but why would the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why ab@@ duct children ?
one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I asked myself again and again : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
you could have put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why would their bodies disappear ?
did these people not have families to whom one could hand over their mortal remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course something remains forever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the idea of showing my father was created during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked what the whole exagger@@ ated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian sentim@@ ents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they supposedly defended were good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes and you forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he replied only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I issued the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can reproach me that I am bi@@ ased . I have finally declared against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly serious cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims in August .
43 The oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life imprisonment in 28 cases and sentenced in nine cases to prison sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the 54 def@@ end@@ ants died during the trial .

all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees .
Pi@@ ero De Monti was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years for justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , which represents the children of people murdered during the dictatorship , said :
the process took more than three years , but the research took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial site could be erected there , which is now being led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in K@@ YO@@ TO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error in a center in Kyoto in which one can pro@@ long its driver &apos;s license .
the photo was published in the social media .
adaptation of Joshua Lev@@ ine &apos;s original photos .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long their driver &apos;s license , last month &apos;s witnesses of a very un@@ successful translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese word ( kor@@ ei@@ rami@@ sha ) , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; was wrong@@ ly translated as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible driver &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
adaptation of the original picture by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n newspaper , which is released in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bad English translation was initially removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate if gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture Police ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported about the ap@@ ology as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that elderly people felt insul@@ ted by inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News addressed a little more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older mot@@ ori@@ sts in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ ori@@ sts . according to the police , the proportion of older mot@@ ori@@ sts , who are involved in accidents throughout the country , gives reasons for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Kyoto , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens made 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
as a result , their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen during the same period .
the above @-@ mentioned repor@@ ter brought commentary to the light in the article published on Yahoo , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently le@@ verage against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo about the translation error has received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How in@@ accurate is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a true translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , you need two important skills : a passive language knowledge to understand the source text and take active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - should not be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ any staff with English as their mother tongue , which could produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees themselves can still make translations company @-@ internal . then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results .
the wor@@ shi@@ ped and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences that arise through mechanical translations show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English wor@@ dings in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic im@@ prints often ador@@ ning t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery . however , careful translations from large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards can be expected .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more reliable source for its translations .
Venezuela : protest and cens@@ orship measures on internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they would not have access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online station .
later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online stations also carried out recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , which were organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups who oppose the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests commen@@ ced at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was tied , and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# C@@ ens@@ orship : enable your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again locked .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net site .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of tur@@ mo@@ il .
traditional media have been reluc@@ tant to report protests since 2014 . back then , the T@@ elec@@ oms Commission threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw it as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels , I have registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two liters of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ IT later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online stations . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions .
prior research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technology through which the DNS servers respond to requests of certain domains correctly .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server rep@@ lies or refuses the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , was dis@@ continued on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who survived the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was put into custody .
Flor@@ es was beaten , while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went to broadcast again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections : this makes Venezu@@ el@@ ans more and more difficult to access multimedia reporting on current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , T@@ ina is fighting for the rights of children and collecting witnesses of other crimes that were just as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .
photo by Ceci@@ lia Ro@@ jas . courtesy of Mod@@ ular .
the following article is the shortened version of a report by Mod@@ ular , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices of Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What has become of something ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a never was treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , in Paraguay there are more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child receives food , an apprenticeship and a roof over her head .
what is not mentioned here , however , is that the children have to spend countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can become - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice , described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization struggling for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke to Cri@@ adi@@ tas - particularly young girls were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated by the Cri@@ adi@@ tas guarantees in general silence .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , which is their daughter in the belief that they complete their training , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out &quot; can be transferred to another family .
on the other hand , the family who takes the girl with herself and justi@@ fies its exploitation by believing that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise be no training and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl becomes ill @-@ treated , his family will learn from it many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent blows . shortly after she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military staff Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra hit Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported about the incident .
they stressed the fact that the murdered child was a cri@@ ti@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF and Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society responsible for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more cows are registered in Paraguay &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children un@@ punished .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for rapid investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o to be sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ k@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín may be trend @-@ setting - for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ ans are exploited not only as labour forces , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , in which her father worked , had to register bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all the way and began selling cand@@ y on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went to school .
only T@@ ina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta into the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked in the house of her employer between four and six hours each day .
in doing so , she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she rose up against five o &apos;clock in the morning and prepared breakfast for her employer .
Fri@@ days , for instance , cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the sooner it was done with learning , the more free time it had .
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but also didn &apos;t have unlimited food . &quot; I needed to get more books from the house library than food from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls .
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ i@@ zers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party who belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition lines like Sen@@ der@@ o or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade her not to believe in the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he kept them intelligent , but did not think about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they felt that I would again learn &quot; bad habits &quot; there . &quot; they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the Indi@@ genous group of Guar@@ ani , would again speak their native language Guar@@ an@@ í back home .

but she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them , with her hard work .
also in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing almost never talked about is bul@@ lying and the har@@ ass@@ ment exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ tas when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ lei@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group .

society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay .
the administration of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hello ! I am looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please log in .
starting from Monday if possible .
the ad received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman , which also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 year old ni@@ ece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the country who wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was written . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author of the ad switched off again :
dear friends , I have found one . I look if it works with her .
thank you , I am writing again when something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , as long ago ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ tiz :
in the course of our history , we managed to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay , where the Spanish Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ ani were ens@@ la@@ ved ) and Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination ( in which the Spanish Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores were given tribute and Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination ) . therefore , it is not to justify that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery , in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and that to display power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill dra@@ gs Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , modified by Global Vo@@ ices .
posted under Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliamentary delegates recently voted in favour of a draft law on &quot; the regulations concerning the use and benefits of social networks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is adopted by the Parliament , users and users of social media in Egypt must be registered with a government agency in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law there would be a place set up to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months of adop@@ ting the law , users must register on the site of the site with their correct names and identity numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could take a penalty of up to six months of imprisonment or a loss of money .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs and is used over the Internet to communicate with others by voice , video and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is en@@ forced when it is adopted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose the registration . unclear is also how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and suppor@@ ter of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the telecommunications department &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall blocking Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical regarding the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leading research techn@@ ologist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I strongly doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion , they imagine that as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I take it seriously , it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens that apply for approval or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court process .
this is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in whose sense the control will be maxim@@ ized and ensured that no dis@@ s@@ enting nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ y@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill of law against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was fores@@ een for those found guilty of men@@ ac@@ ing &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;
how a Kurdish nature prot@@ ector protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in Iraq

this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions .
high up in the mountains of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the NGO Nature Iraq are working on protecting the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard .
a sub@@ species of the le@@ op@@ ards that ro@@ amed through Africa and Asia are among the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered because of po@@ aching , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and as they always find less loo@@ t .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as R@@ aza shows up in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish eco @-@ system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that there is a big pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the free wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera all , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist R@@ aza passion@@ ately likes to show a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and advoc@@ ates that protection zones for wildlife in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region are established .

early March 2017 documented the progress made for the northeast of Japan , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress that has been achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had triggered the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was one of several pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast that had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to flee , for the ts@@ un@@ ami had let entire coastal towns disappear from the map .
in addition to this , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture experienced an atomic accident , for this alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows , from a local point of view , the progress achieved six years later in order to rebuild the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and the survey results of those affected .
apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned substitute buildings were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , and 80 percent of the planned spare houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma accounts for 70 percent of the final light .
nevertheless , one still endeav@@ ours to reloc@@ ate to final spare houses six years after the disaster .
after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma ev@@ acu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful on this occasion . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated who lived after the disaster in temporary shel@@ ters were res@@ ett@@ led to final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure here is 34 percent .
the status of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1,@@ 100 schools affected by disaster have re@@ opened their gates until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are in operation again , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident suffered extensively in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent of destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are in the &quot; nuclear black@@ out zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is still lag@@ ging behind .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o paper also reports that since the disaster nearly half of the coastal residents , it is more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to obtain a general picture , the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and the ev@@ ac@@ uation . she asked her about the state of reconstruction and how her emp@@ athy has changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in its introduction , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surv@@ eyed said that disaster prevention has not yet been done enough .
how it is for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in her issue for the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has focused its attention on the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
of 16@@ 0,000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma nearly 63 thousand people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been res@@ ett@@ led in permanent replacement houses .
after the 2017 stand still 40@@ 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in disaster areas , most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation companies still live in shel@@ ters , older than 50 years old , are well known because efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma must compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after he was beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva in a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer had killed him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a head@@ stock against his head . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on him on Saturday and transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a strike . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás reported that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the investigation of the incident was suspended by the active service .
the pictures show the police officer , as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be seen on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel by media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video filmed by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one sees Mat@@ eus being attacked by the police officer and several param@@ e@@ dic@@ s ha@@ sten shortly afterwards .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also filmed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus living in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( about 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while lying in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado rec@@ alls more attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás has witnessed a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , because he had been sab@@ ot@@ aging the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group had been sab@@ ot@@ aged only to de@@ crimin@@ alize teachers , and here we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a police officer who struck him with a stick on his face .
police Hand@@ les
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
polic@@ emen settled in protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for or@@ ators , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the deputy , Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , the Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have covered street protests by directing the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window screen .
the fol@@ ks of São Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo deliberately reported about a broken glass window to decorate their front pages illustr@@ atively with a photo .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane as about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any kind of damage .
here , too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; ob@@ tains an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate significance , and the typical acts of violence in the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot;
the Un@@ char@@ ted Vill@@ ages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane mills in the whole of Cuba closed doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ e@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no notable sugar harvest on site .
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane mills were paraly@@ zed .
after the fall , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
approximately 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ig@@ ned and commu@@ te daily to the factories that still ground .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who stands up every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active period because they were preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members carefully that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad administration decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but bad harv@@ ests are no longer a news anymore .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the community saw even better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically out@@ dated and barely competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
but the sugar price rose again a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os needs to remain per pound , according to the 2016 report by the OECD and FAO , the Agricultural and Food Organisation of the United Nations .
if the current production reached the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years there was a shut@@ down of 98 sugar cane mills , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about closing the factory , is the word he repe@@ ats most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all those surv@@ eyed said the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time work@@ group .
before the first leap year , the first letters began to come .
it was a matter of officially written documents that would differ only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and date .
all of them were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was over@@ hau@@ led and the letters were getting more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane mills that were still in operation , &quot; he affir@@ ms .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and most important work@@ stations has been wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , no alternatives were created for the jobs and services generated by the facilities in the municipalities where they were located .
we will never know if during the M@@ amm@@ oth speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President saw in the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane mills
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only highly by milling .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to de@@ grade them , they also stopped asp@@ hal@@ ing the road , this also depri@@ ves other companies .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a future perspective many young people also left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production serves not even for the supply of the municipality .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine yields give the old soldier a rent of two thousand p@@ eso a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a follow@@ ing@@ person , yet he does not obsc@@ ure the lies that he told him .
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
N@@ ene walks in retirement for 65 years , not because it lacks power , but because it is em@@ bit@@ tered .

the original workshops were conducted by Ped@@ ago@@ gic David H@@ od@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and worked in Northern Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop is thus increasing that young participants in conversations like &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a street section in Western Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs despite the influence of glob@@ alization .
many of the songs were published in Indi@@ genous Languages , although the young@@ sters do not always rule the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly of the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dial@@ ect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like no one ever is interested in me
but I try to continue my days on earth
this is the day when you will hear our cry
because as a youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and also go ahead with our youth
so they can do what she decre@@ ed for the Creator
in the comments section , the reader and advoc@@ ate of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contributes and adds the sl@@ ings to sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( more or less ) outside of a typical Japanese restaurant .

in Japan , one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
in order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , they are presented by each dish that is served in this restaurant near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( of course , of course , &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) .
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether to enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a lot of these small companies that have just made those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are usually not even noticeable . however , a new trend now turns them into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets .
with Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome the blo@@ gger wrote a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special store : new mobile phone belts decorated with plastic rib@@ bons as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in ess@@ ences is becoming increasingly more complex .
in this case an orph@@ an @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that keeps your mobile batter@@ ed :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some mobile phone and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my cell phone with salmon roe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our newest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and w@@ rist@@ bands made of dried salmon .
further whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal plastic dishes can be viewed at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ om@@ blog post . or follow the h@@ ash@@ tag # as well as the # ! !
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics . these , however , do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this battle ent@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses such as El Ch@@ apo Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the s@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the gri@@ eving or the communities who have learned to live with the pain .
behind each bone find , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ing a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; learning to live with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , which aims to give these victims a voice and tells stories of people who were fighting in the fight between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project like this :
organised crime does not only let us fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities have to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear lives changed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret tom@@ bs for his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who in only one day lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ est : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday , we are preparing ourselves today for the task that we have set ourselves before , to go to the graves , to the people we have loved looking for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th , he was supposed to be back , but he never returned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here with me .
at the moment , she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but they don &apos;t get paid off because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and governance .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a researcher of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have been familiar with illness and sensation@@ alism for several years now .
I pass newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists .
it brings me out of the compos@@ ure .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only person who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it seems like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks that he wants to become a Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ cker ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal for people to hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fu@@ tility of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ aking up &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they don &apos;t stir and stand still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main city district &quot; : how a family was pl@@ under@@ ed with threats . &quot; this describes how armed criminals squee@@ zed money from their business for month until they end up destroying not only the business , but also broke their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never passes , the trauma remains , fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap you or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days whether wines would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega released the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ char@@ ted Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how about growing up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents care about them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , s@@ own potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm , and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , saw the bloody body of his father , shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as a result of organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the Prosecutor &apos;s Office amounted to 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country .
only a few stories live in the face of ever @-@ new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ing a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data whose objective is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking that has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this article and the pages to which it links contain images on which violence is represented .
the fact @-@ check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the year after something has appeared the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let us take this picture of a terrible accident at the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) seven years ago .
since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to see trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures on news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker tra@@ vers@@ ed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people lost their lives .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected and devast@@ ated for years . the streets in the region became dangerous roads full of po@@ thol@@ es , which were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tan@@ ker fell victim to this .
the official representative described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses including a movie theater near , which was full of people who watched the World Cup .
houses scattered and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
a picture entitled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident depic@@ t the gra@@ y@@ ful scenes of the day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are str@@ ung on the floor while people watch them .
but here the story does not end .
over the years the same photo has been recorded several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters from B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses dras@@ tically reported atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed behind to count dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one inhabit@@ ant to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be depicted figur@@ atively .
the attack was also unclear , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt by B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo showed up again , as it was fal@@ sely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ appropri@@ ations ; Africa Check has documented assignments in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as a cover for mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely relate the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to supply arguments .
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash report published by the United Nations , those who could flee could strike , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts appeared like the following which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this image comes from an Saudi Arabian news site that fal@@ sely claimed that President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein had said that monks and politicians had participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , which was finally accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations called AF@@ P as their source , had also fal@@ sely attributed th@@ ein to this statement , but had not associated with it the image of the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false coupling date back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information can transc@@ end boundaries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures at 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) , similar to the said picture of DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ h of private sites , platforms of social media and community and national publications , and are available in many languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have sent false reports , some have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of impro@@ per use and linked them to the respective countries based on what site they were published on . this way we want to show the range more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases are also linked to each other ) several examples may come from impro@@ per use .
here are some cases which can now be felt completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fra@@ mes .

the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or false reports .

as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .

even within Nigeria , the DR Congo photo was shared as proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo , with a tweet expressing sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to del@@ ude the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being prosec@@ uted , since the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a reference to what it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intentionally obsc@@ ured news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings in terms of Myanmar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this judge , which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of sm@@ ells that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech run and be used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often distributed by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; aspir@@ ations , f@@ atten@@ ing , &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) .
this post , directed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , makes it clear that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page wrong@@ ly claimed that the president of Myanmar was Th@@ ein Sein in 2012 that monks and politicians had been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture will remain in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the recently deleted News page An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , has explicitly stated that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was put into circulation later in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were links to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world is asleep ) .
the image of the DR Congo showed , with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve a greater attention to these events , which took place in the name of Islam in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was taken as evidence of the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and over 9,@@ 300 times saved ) , but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison with Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Indonesian ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false message .
from the embassy in which the picture was taken from the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced himself .
there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
Tin@@ Eye is also indic@@ ative of other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the folder in grey ) but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and images
there are two strong topics or frames ( fra@@ me@@ works ) that push through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence associated with the assass@@ ination of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
understanding religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media there are tens of people who in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently have a share of drinking water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and bel@@ itt@@ ens the actual horror of what happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent pictures has already been comprehen@@ sively deb@@ ated ( here for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , there is concern that violent pictures will sensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take the ability to emp@@ ath@@ ize emp@@ athy ( such as this study investigating how violent media work to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss with regard to violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used detached from the context or in a completely ab@@ u@@ sive manner .
however , each examination of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons used according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. inv@@ inci@@ ble ) stri@@ ves to provide language enthusiasts with a selection of words from all over the world which are difficult or not to be translated at all .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these inv@@ alu@@ able words are already well @-@ known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish Sob@@ ra@@ esa ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find for example words from the Ta@@ p language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - thank you for your parents in recognition of how they have been working for you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the Hun@@ s@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after you &apos;ve been warming up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they def@@ use other cultures , reveal different thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish even more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive are these small languages .
speakers of &quot; Treas@@ ure Languages &quot; which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite words here .

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe in the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally ends at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya have come across the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the disaster center of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost 100 people were missed because of the floods and mud winds .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100,000 people were brought to 304 reliable residen@@ ces .
the rain falls gradually on Saturday ( 27 May ) and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the scale of the flood disaster :
flood waters in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many people use the has@@ h tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s fatal floods wor@@ sen the food crisis , save the Children after further ra@@ ins are already on the way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus stood in the flood , water level of up to 6 meters . the village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle is also floo@@ ded due to the water p@@ eg@@ els of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and another five are made for the transport of emergency supplies to the residents enclosed in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - information des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian assistance .
if any search and rescue ships require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the taxi call app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks anxi@@ ous people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the cad@@ ast@@ oph@@ en@@ centre is informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood control &quot; button that allowed users to call for a vehicle to pick up assistance and don@@ ate . they were then forwarded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross free of charge .
they also launched an &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by floods and land@@ slides .
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka in which several social media platforms are fully exploited bring residents in need of security and provide assistance .
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy .

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love girlfriend .
I entr@@ ust her to her four years old daughter , she confi@@ deth to me her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in one minute we are still calling slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
in the next we can make decisions for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the i@@ kon@@ ian image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , others cann@@ on slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that have built up in their imagination .
you have to get rid of me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t look all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in a different way . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who do not fit in there , will be de@@ vised .
de@@ mi@@ ci@@ li@@ zation will be
I am not alone with that .
this is even happened to the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day when he died .
but in the Western imagination , Rum@@ i &apos;s religion was er@@ ased , as was the most popular translation of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims that have been colon@@ ising Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing ima@@ gery is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid destroyed the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures still prot@@ ru@@ de today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to keep track of it .
I have been working in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , flaw@@ ed nar@@ r@@ atives dominate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries during the last three decades , while the US won &apos;t even choose her first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative disc@@ erns the fact that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and forced Saudi Arabian , Muslim women to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women leading movements for change .
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer @-@ Muslims .
this narrative has so deep and flaw@@ ed our collective imagination that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children become the goal of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
belonging to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we are doing more than telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rations which help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims in the highest degree constitute the &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America .
more than a third of the entire Muslim population is African @-@ speaking Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims are one of the first generation immigrants origin@@ ating from 77 countries .
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in New York sky@@ scra@@ pers ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan re@@ designed the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were ir@@ res@@ isti@@ bly Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and an American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes out or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs that all Muslims carry - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ est , we don &apos;t wear all the pocket peb@@ bles with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim milit@@ ants and inter@@ religious activists trying to combat widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islamic propaganda machine with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for false information , which have manipul@@ ated our already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what is a Muslim ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in more than just a stranger that tears the veil on a woman .
or as the terri@@ fying card of attacks on mos@@ ques throughout the U.S. , see below .

anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility in its most ug@@ ly forms interfer@@ es with our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity , which is so broad , so versatile and complex that it cannot possibly fit into a drawer .

use approved .
I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim has only then been born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a temporary mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims when she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I held her in my arms and whis@@ pered to her the Arabic verse to protect the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .
the author &apos;s grand@@ mother , when she wins an ik@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , pos@@ ing with her sisters some@@ time in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging is the picture of my grand@@ mother on the mother &apos;s side with her sisters ; as she has been winning a competition of art of flower arrangements in Kar@@ achi decades ago .
it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings of painted Su@@ fi saint ; and a Qur &apos;@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
being Muslim means to speak the prayers that she had told me to speak when I have a bad day .
to be Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : God Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a nation that has been coloni@@ zed for centuries by a &quot; empire &quot; that a company founded with the name of worthy British East @-@ inian Company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather we@@ eps .
in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan cried out to his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , a family that he could not close to his arms in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , like my grandfather , have been torn apart by coloni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at stake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; being Muslim means knowing that over the last two centuries , Europeans have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coloni@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the up to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir under@@ tan of British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he introduced the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I had ever been and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed across every continent except Antar@@ c@@ tica , have gone to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the w@@ reck@@ age of the war .
to be an American Muslim is to know that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy visits the U.S. and the suspect has a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago , the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave named Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago , an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple times , but failing to communicate them to others .
the narrative of the 1.7 billion hi@@ des more possibilities than a cube , but is represented in the reducing duality of &quot; we &quot; against them .
to be a mother means to worry about my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this duality .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim registr@@ ations that started with President Bush and extended to President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child into hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it exists in a country that sh@@ uts its borders with people from just the countries it bombs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ F@@ ly @-@ List &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which mainly targeted Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are wars we are leading and the bombs that we throw off Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell we are here today .
in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists at the Nor@@ th@@ western University presented a scientific un@@ real picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims got the lowest score .
the conversations that we must lead
we are too deep to describe the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the flaw@@ ed and dangerous pic@@ torial prints that we get in our news @-@ news .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history with hy@@ ph@@ ens .
the Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video series Secret Light of Muslims ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square on black American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global point of time we are in .
and that moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ ori@@ sts who existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier , it had not yet existed ; now they have ma@@ stered large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who today made me an un@@ disputed Muslim .
things I have left in my speech here as a bread@@ cr@@ umb .
things that perhaps awaken memories , for in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made to another .
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations in the framework of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia take place .
more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not concepts with which we usually throw at our schools around us or that we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why am I referring to this here at TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are w@@ aged and people are enth@@ r@@ alled by creating the &quot; other &quot; in the public presentation , was even scientific Stan@@ ford four decades ago .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of this , consciously and un@@ consciously to soli@@ di@@ fy the &quot; other &quot; ; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because the occupation that we had no president , the chocolate cake , while he already bom@@ bed countries and &quot; other made &quot; people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban linguistic diversity
history of history , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Daniele Rossi , using the CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global Vo@@ ices &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported recently about a different initiative by Steven Bird , the inv@@ alu@@ able blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain and appreciate the linguistic diversity of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there .
the following applies to the feasibility of the project :
the mass ext@@ inction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces in which inhabitants don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while listening to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often to understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to listening , to feel , to tie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers prepare their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers , their dedication and representation make it possible for the audience to be informed .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ du@@ ou Council takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical of her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara tells the f@@ ables of the Rab@@ bit and the Bab@@ oon in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his f@@ ables , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
you &apos;ve listened to it !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities and the organis@@ ers hope to extend this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico calls for rein@@ statement of public debt from the US
with the aim of a new audit of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to $ 72 million , on 3 April 2017 , various religious and bourgeois organizations took part in a mass demonstration ; the March began with the Mexican cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la deu@@ da &quot; ( ci@@ vic front for the re @-@ examination of debt ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical Church meeting in Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of re @-@ establishing the debt have also filed a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico claim that the politicians , bank@@ ers and government officials responsible for the debts are to be held ac@@ coun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding remuneration that operates in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le with dec@@ lining pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the island - not the United States &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integrated territory - suffers from a severe financial crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on national responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos requires extensive restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measures imposed from outside will be at risk without the participation and conviction of citizens , rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration was called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :
demonstr@@ ators are preparing for the march .

it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what are the real costs associated with it .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra Pr@@ ison where he was sitting on October 3 , 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or place of residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that pus@@ hes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , and instantly .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have started to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we abandoned in this process of inter@@ mitt@@ ent extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown place from the A@@ dra Pr@@ ison , a non @-@ military facility .
his wife , the writer and lawyer , N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el , based on a command from the military court , had taken part in A@@ dra as a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his place of residence and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that Bass@@ el founded , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ tille &apos;s cultural prototypes was more for@@ esi@@ ghted than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of many civili@@ zations and here the Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he started working , the IS would do anything to extingu@@ ish this architecture which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace it .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was already in custody .
I have learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked . he has taught others to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he has also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a commission which she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was imprisoned .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for one year .
she s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available license @-@ free .
cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It Happ@@ ens &quot; :
it takes place during each visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the mind in the moment we embrace ,
that each of the haz@@ ards doesn &apos;t matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kl@@ es and guards
I forget the crow@@ ding of the prison
and I go into every detail of your voice and words
whom I bear with passion ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my sol@@ itude ,
to rec@@ laim all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile over your absence .
I charge myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the arrest of Bass@@ el G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
one year passes , my soul
during the course of time
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ tille &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared since the beginning of the protests against Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime in 2011 .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tor@@ tured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in custody since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our demand today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambique : Director after release of corruption again on previous post
Moz@@ ambique &apos;s anger re@@ acted to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state machine after half of his sentence in which the corruption was committed .
Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 together with four other def@@ end@@ ants , was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambique , where Cam@@ ba@@ za &apos;s advice was between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good management and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which took place on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s Office of the Republic , which rejected the motion , there would be no reason for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post since the company did not carry out disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants do not welcome the action .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution that advoc@@ ates public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to restore the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that even the company should have instit@@ uted a disciplinary action against the offen@@ ding one .
the company , however , seemed to be silent and did not make appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ can social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za is a competent person , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of it had been granted .
he could give paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish up his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
to the contrary !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director does not possess any mor@@ als :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that already insul@@ ted the state so mas@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing mor@@ als and serving the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served itself on the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself became tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded in such a way .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el &apos;s pris@@ ons not only for the first independent president but also as a sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic speaker .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was , as he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious human being is capable of all , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not like that . he changes the tactics but he does not turn aside from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was sitting for 10 years and released .
and today the company , at which he is making money , res@@ ets him under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ Jak@@ ub ( @ az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) 12 May 2017
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo from the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( zu dt . : @ truth ) states that crimin@@ ality is paying off in Moz@@ ambique :

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ its .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely degra@@ ding conn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for its use have been cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with different mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chairs in Bur@@ m@@ ese are also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ki@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explains the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was er@@ ased today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way , if they knew how he could allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a play of words .
the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is convinced that she will reduce hate speech by radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook needs to be more analy@@ tic before del@@ eting all posts that are suspected of spreading rac@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook doesn &apos;t delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Facebook .
what should be done instead is to analyze the post carefully and check it by checking the nearby words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have shown that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to extingu@@ ish his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive by Facebook , I made a post to tell my facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to watch , post and share content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; did not meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has removed a large number of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speeches of radical nation@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech removed from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
to cens@@ or such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fake posts .
if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a great turnover , that would be great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cens@@ orship has provided a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of taking it seriously , users now laugh at Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken off the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that didn &apos;t contain hate speech , but were removed :
used with approval .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail that contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally heat the violence in Myanmar &apos;s communities , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to take control of the hat@@ eful hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but rather than simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at the context rather than concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end of the chil@@ dr@@ ens &apos; marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the pedi@@ gree is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law aimed at bann@@ ing this practice so that the age of marriage is now 18 .
prior to this amend@@ ment of the proceedings , some members of Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities were adher@@ ing to the practice , and in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ ly Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , since that , age did not determine maturity . &quot;
this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago were a contractual partner to the UN Convention on Child Rights , which is defined as min@@ ors under the age of 18 .
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who had already been married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that in 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married under 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements , trying to aboli@@ sh the laws of child@@ birth , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this outcome .
nevertheless everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about saying the critics of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children &apos;s marriage &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they should , dam@@ ned , take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition was responsible for tensions in this actually un@@ complicated case , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the draft law .
but in early 2017 , the draft law against the child marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and let the law declare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and not a single one against it .
once it was decided in the Senate , the draft may now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thri@@ lled , because the laws on the pedi@@ gree were finally changed .
Facebook Member Lov@@ ell Francis , who comm@@ its a minist@@ erial post in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk to disgu@@ ise the kernel of the matter , but do you know what ? the pedi@@ gree is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and it &apos;s worth almost any price .
while Abel Jackson was of the opinion that it took a long time to aboli@@ sh practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally came :
public Status Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , &quot; Out@@ standing news !
the Act has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for this - 0 on the other hand ! ! ! ! &quot;
torture Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the marriage @-@ enabled age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft for the amend@@ ment of the marriage network was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties and 35 of them were present in the vote .
all MPs , who were contrary , voted for the law .
the children &apos;s marriage is legally banned in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # fac@@ ile shiel@@ ds .
many thanks to all the activists who have fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hin@@ du organization of the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take legal action , the law should be passed and he seems to deliver his promise now .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite law@@ fully if Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wished to approach the debate in a different way .
Patri@@ cia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
dear Sat , instead of discussing the discussion so broad@@ ly , instead of talking about the problem that we are inviting the state to our bedroom , &quot; simply pur@@ pos@@ efully say that the state , our daughters , protects that it may be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in advantage to them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where child marriage is legal or still the norm in different levels , even though there are laws which they prohi@@ bit .

by mirr@@ oring websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content
the Wikipedia page was published on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally obsc@@ ured .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey has opened the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series are resist@@ ing the ban . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although many tech sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using wra@@ pping tools for blocked web pages ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia , as recently published in a report published by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to be locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. computer calcul@@ ator connections ) , which does not rely on the domain name system and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
however , the content is available in spite of legal prohibition .
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( about the block@@ age of Wikipedia ) we did everything to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents in decentr@@ alized and distributed ways .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was performed independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it was merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirrors page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors , when in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked .
Con@@ son@@ ville reported sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member and staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy @-@ address , a mirror .
you access another URL that is not the original . that what you see is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia , even if they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

I just stopped at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida lodge ) called me . he had received a phone call from my father that would be a le@@ op@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other river side where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he was to know it , for he had already faced tig@@ ers face to face ,
a tiger is not disturbed by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bu@@ ggy appeared . he sits down immediately , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
his passion for fo@@ stering Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent to shoot at Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .

this paper was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version has been re@@ published as part of a Content @-@ Sharing convention .
in many parts of India , women with the greatest care avoid the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that because of the social pressure they respect the husband and the fear of the consequences , they should dis@@ regard the norm , preserve this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted by the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a false tri@@ bunal and inf@@ ring@@ ed by her family and village community after having addressed a married family with a name .
the tradition not to mention their wives by name is also common among men . however , they have far less fear to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village Wal@@ let in P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health workers and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and quickly became the main theme of the city .
it is a place for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs , which exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates for the disman@@ tling of the patri@@ archy .
for seven years , Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z has been working with the help of her video camera to detect practices such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and manages these clubs .
it reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video , which Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion , acted by women who do not call her hus@@ bands at their name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open a discussion about the patri@@ archy with a problem that women could easily identify with .
to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands out loud is a custom that they have du@@ ti@@ fully perpet@@ u@@ ated and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by her name so far , wanted to try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by his name from now on .
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club .
many women never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion going .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the names of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , that means they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Ra@@ ini Pa@@ ola from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a secular tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
a woman was so shy that she only gi@@ g@@ gled to herself during the whole exercise ; another decided to release all the accumulated fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
still in the rush of adren@@ aline about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that at home they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands at their name .
and they kept their word .
in the coming days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member chose to do it for dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law started to arrest her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake .
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy .
Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the cin@@ ogen@@ ic dot on the forehead that shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus :
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would carry the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; point if he did it too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped bearing him .
the other women have not stopped completely , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last months they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their life ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so sincer@@ ely about some things , for example , as our identi@@ ties are attached to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have only borne Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a sage tur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants ; they didn &apos;t dare .
after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of one &apos;s dress code , the mor@@ ale associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini s@@ mu@@ ggles up her own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ shirts ) into a discussion round so that women could wear them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will create it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since the beginning of the discussion , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly rolling :
so far we have done only small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped saying the name of her husband .
some , including me , still do it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two continue to say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women are wearing Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at all times .
the women in the Dis@@ cussion Club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like sli@@ pping around more freedom of movement or their own clothes - are at the end of a hard @-@ to @-@ navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini declares :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not just limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we &apos;re talking about and what we &apos;re doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first visit to Japan by The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les during their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official Beat@@ les YouTube channel .
on June 29th of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , re@@ marked the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here quickly became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les first came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail@@ er Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good morning ! today the Beat@@ les commem@@ oration day is in Japan . back to 51 years ago , they were here in Tokyo .
even today songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese secondary schools .
the Beat@@ les kit@@ sch survi@@ ves everything .
today is the Beat@@ les commem@@ oration day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll should represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese , of course , also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the familiar places related to the band .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , that is your 5 places you absolutely must visit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lan@@ e
5 ) ( from the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is the Beat@@ les commem@@ oration day .
exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
the same thing we did last year too .
and of course some companies also use the fan community in terms of market terms , such as this R@@ amen shop ( Japanese no@@ od@@ les are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
and what could it be for a day ?
I will listen to Y@@ ester@@ day today and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .
so the day will be lost today .
so , we hope you &apos;re here !

bald men are de@@ ported and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia police warned the people that bald men could be a target of attacks in Moz@@ ambique .
photo : An@@ ders Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0
a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald individuals for organ traffi@@ cking , probably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , is disturbing the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government has now called a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and some of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
there is a local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man can hold gold or bring wealth , &quot; said the police officer of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the aim of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN implemented a mission in South Africa in 2016 in order to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , particularly in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are going to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambique are target of ritual attacks , the Moz@@ ambi@@ can police warned of the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
hus@@ ky Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the town of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police had already followed the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for presumably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to which the sacrifices in the head might have power to generate wealth .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been killed in this part of the country .
on Facebook , Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared the chron@@ ic@@ le of the B@@ log@@ gers &apos; poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa explaining that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambique :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ ED IN@@ IN Moz@@ ambique , TH@@ AT I am ashamed of a country in which people would have shame to demand sex against good marks , and would even take their lives to earn their bread , a country where people wouldn &apos;t be hun@@ ted or even bald for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some missed the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re hum@@ our .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist from Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter users , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ app@@ el , and the police officer Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both are bald :
the Moz@@ ambi@@ can authorities are very concerned about the assass@@ ination of bald men .

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and express our heart@@ felt sympathy to his family , friends and those who have known and loved him .
a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria , actively engaged in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) is a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our Arab blo@@ gger 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons who were themselves out@@ si@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that her husband had been sentenced to death but did not give any further information .
Bas@@ tille &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a heard of Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we are doing all the work of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of the open web movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we honor the efforts of all the people and organizations that have been campaig@@ ning for his release in the last five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against the regime of Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , thus the organization of Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested by the regime or forci@@ bly disappeared are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have come to death in custody , the international human rights organization Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

free Bass@@ el : N@@ eti@@ zen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community on the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published under a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been admitted to hospital because of liver cancer .
in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( murder ) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal affair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a speaker that he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to release views from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him treatment abroad .
while some countries critici@@ zed the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely turned out the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations , united nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to facilitate treatment abroad .
Norway - Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Minister of Foreign Affairs B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ enden have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway was stag@@ gering after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume exports to China as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill @-@ headed , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was not able to accept his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the EU &apos;s top diplom@@ at , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ us as she announced in an statement on 30 June :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also expect China to lift up all the restrictions of Mr Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told the Americans that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want him to have the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as he can help him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth @-@ Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the embassy calls on the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. Embassy &apos;s request drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the Foreign Ministry &apos;s statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and un@@ answer@@ able remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , which it claims according to Chinese constitution and judicial system and international obligations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz also adopted a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally .
I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condi@@ tionally so that he can embar@@ k on a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany City breaks Private accommodation
&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets all the medical support he needs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing to the Reu@@ ters news agency that China had large concerns as to whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide adequate medical care to Li@@ u and give him the opportunity to be cared for by his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer previously told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room at the hospital and that it is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to talk and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to allow for the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France , France
in a statement on 29 June , China issued the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all the necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where it is needed . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information that France will eventually receive it .
Taiwan and Taiwan
the Council of continental affairs in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance towards those who advoc@@ ate peaceful means to promote political reform and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu M@@ ei @-@ n@@ u of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual lip to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed his concern in an explanation on June 28 at Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt very moved and encouraged personally when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or Country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid since Singapore is internationally recognised as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was to be considered a city .
this re@@ mark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the International Bran@@ ch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supports Singapore as a city to be considered .
... nobody asked if New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o blog acc@@ uses the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices , to create this precious land , one hears that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very clas@@ sy : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in the face of it , he inevitably appears un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally towns which are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core of the theme , the good old ly@@ re pop@@ s up from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leave the twi@@ sted logic as it fits better to their power .
in the end , the responses given last week by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ answers .
correspon@@ dingly , he tar@@ ried ration@@ ally with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion , since she did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to what country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very thank@@ ful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point insofar as it was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out on the critics that one should start reading the whole text of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements made by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
please read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ important even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities were seeing a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who is the leader of a growing generation , who makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes that is really associated and aware of what he &apos;s defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ covers the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
did Herr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam commit &quot; good faith a mistake &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian advoc@@ ate ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , in which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but do they not defend their country ?
who must pay back our Prime Minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ID ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
according to the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade , Singapore is and has always been a city :
&quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapur ...
no one has ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global Vo@@ ices &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently asked its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home country or homeland ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
their answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , with which rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world are revealed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the most recent part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is most asked for me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in its inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication follows usually the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Hock@@ ey , Nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans may cook internally against anger when they are held for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther me .
for someone who does not know himself , there is little that separates us Can@@ adi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans will bring a Canadian flag well visible to their ru@@ cksack when they travel .
everyone loves Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans however ... .
so it was when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think that Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Canadian are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you &apos;d be confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first of all , being called &quot; nice &quot; means to be di@@ ligent - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has an own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing in which you can come across .
to be harmless means to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far from the things that happen around you .
I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a leading part of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
we lack the warm , open kindness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau will stage the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ dies Thailand &apos;s j@@ un@@ ta
a pop @-@ band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that par@@ o@@ dies the j@@ un@@ ta , which in 2014 seized power and , in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells about the prec@@ ep@@ ts his girlfriend makes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not explicitly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the j@@ un@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was divided 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand , after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , particularly as it relates to the situation of the country under the j@@ un@@ ta rule .
take a look at these images of the video , which relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary constitution granting the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision making on important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adjustment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are viewed as critics of the j@@ un@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army that monitors online content and persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy to have prosec@@ uted .
Thailand establishes a strict law against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic offensive ) .
martial law was proclaimed in Thailand on 20 May 2014 .
two days later it came to a coup in the army .
one of the problems that the j@@ un@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax pay@@ ers .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before placing them in an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are imprisoned because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should insul@@ t the monarchy .
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song showed members of the band , who im@@ itated the tribute of &quot; The Hunger Games , &quot; which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the 2014 protests .
life continues in the ruins of gh@@ ost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society is only slowly recovered in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ is@@ panic war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still highly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ p@@ ava are located in the coal bas@@ ins of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups , such as Russians , Greeks , East Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians , lived and worked together on Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , for the most part , Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 people after having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ k@@ ha@@ k@@ ha@@ ka , stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are dec@@ ayed and very rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha village I met a native elderly man .
he starts a conversation and it is hard for him to end it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , which served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived here and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ k@@ ho@@ kas , which house one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately pull back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother for@@ ba@@ de us to let ourselves be photograph@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappears .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultiv@@ ating agricultural products for personal use ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable growing .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
in winter the district administration offers free candles and bread to the villages .

about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ aly@@ a , as it is called in the neighborhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dj@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina does not leave off Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will stay in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia forever , &quot; she says .
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial aid from her daughter and insist@@ ed that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit ourselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we can &apos;t do it all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; aun@@ t G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini .

&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds herself of the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Belarus , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia was simply gone ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha holds about $ 9 child allow@@ ance for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house , where the Nat@@ asha kinder@@ garten was once located , they hold pigs , cows , har@@ es and chi@@ ckens .
she tells us that at first it was a very sc@@ ary situation when a lot of people left the village after the war .
but over time , she lost her anxiety .

you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and everyone lived just as it was right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day that the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation has ended , a little boy runs over to us .

he plays with the ball rolling the hill .
a group of children now persec@@ utes the ball .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Afrika &quot; houses immigrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border from Mexico to Guatemala .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places for their hospitality are known .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is run by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink gold frame and golden earrings in t@@ ed@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 per night , guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and metal beds .
in the vesti@@ bu@@ le there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells , people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Afrika !
&quot; &quot; &quot; where are you Mama Africa ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather quiet at the moment , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on cardboard .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them medication that they cannot afford , she massages them with a bal@@ m of the feet exhausted by the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ ai Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa was a proper nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ee be@@ ard ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her , because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao is travelling with his sister hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans are already talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his trip to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
MS Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her that her guests often send her text messages when they left to greet her or to report her about the course of her trip .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana .
MS Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a cu@@ l de sa@@ c leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after living for three years , he was exp@@ elled after a raid on his workplace from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he has fled to Honduras with his wife and three children in front of people who wanted to ex@@ ert money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single teacher , offered him their roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next step is to go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests again .
passengers quietly consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
MS Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who went away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she leaves her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair @-@ fle@@ ets she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she briefly imag@@ ines her .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; they have gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang people are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication equipment in X@@ inj@@ ang of t@@ witter @-@ users as well as progres@@ sively more
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an neighborhood of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell phone notification in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Clear@@ ance &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app will prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities knew how to use the app for more than fighting terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after installing the app , they had exchanged messages with a private chat group .
in inform@@ ing the police , the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , ebooks and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app with the min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can , of course , be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while noti@@ fications of digital cens@@ orship in China mainly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those living in remote , repres@@ sed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit disturbances and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( b ) , the cens@@ ored news published in China , showed photos from a check@@ point where polic@@ emen were random@@ ly checking out whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered at a check@@ point with a device without this software , you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
you have forced people to use devices intended for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the sequ@@ encing technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( b &amp; b ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description which highlights that the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus obtain un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
all governmental branches , authorities and institutions connected with the party , including universities and research institutes , are obliged to follow the instructions given by the Cyber@@ security Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard disks , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police until August 1 .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible off@@ ences , including those referring to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
one single cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at you and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything that is important has disappeared .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth clearly recognis@@ able from both inside and outside .
one that makes all honour to their name .
one that has put down a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if reality reco@@ vers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters become transformed into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubts dissolve in smoke and you become aware of your existence even when the Earth is moving on the axis of the evil . you realize that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone built around stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest , such as we@@ eds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough that the city rav@@ aged the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cri@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all quarters were cov@@ eted , not my own one .
for the first time it was still , mo@@ tion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I did not make high demands on a city which is blocked up into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things settled down somewhat after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence , scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice re@@ pul@@ sed through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we allied ourselves to a magnificent picture full of my expectations .
in such a moment you realize that you liber@@ ate the spirit out of the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the slightest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the Military Security Building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he set up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way up to the security service office .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me also hear how you write &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you &apos;re only brave enough to sh@@ out if we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was about my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my case when I replied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest chat that could have such disa@@ strous consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal to that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed movement lies in my nose to this day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture I was exposed to for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I pass through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything that I carry with myself .
then back through the yard and into the second office which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I introduce all the details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they probably allocated a bigger cell to me this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one other prisoner and I am allowed to sit down immediately without waiting for permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I res@@ or@@ ted to an old @-@ tried communication method : to strike against the wall with his fist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my boss was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first @-@ chief &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was an emin@@ ent middle @-@ aged man that looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , no marked facial features can be recognized by me , and there are no doctors here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all rep@@ lies deny its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will immediately hear .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to ch@@ ase all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ ored on the fruit in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be at about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around this time the cri@@ es are heard , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that showed us the Gre@@ ys in Person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be inter@@ ro@@ gated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was aired : in order to protect and prevent the state security from us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail map and betra@@ yed the narrow vision of their view of the world .
this is not a house that is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminal &apos;s criminal into a hero .
I enter the inter@@ ro@@ gation room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and stock@@ y man ; at least he comes to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he cat@@ ches a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that der@@ ail@@ ment him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join those Ta@@ ge@@ di@@ ans and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to answer .
I really can &apos;t say exactly when insul@@ ts and hits after a friendly chat have become an ordinary means of communication for me .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished if I had done nothing to deserve this punishment .
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; con@@ fession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er delights in your cry .
give him pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you can &apos;t hold back your cri@@ es .
my cry did not suff@@ ice him yet , which is why they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator used to work as a garbage collector or whether it belonged to normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables together to show us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them changed , while I was still at the turn .
I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I listened to scre@@ am .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and didn &apos;t enjoy it , which is why he was next to an electrically charged staff .
electricity flow@@ ed through my whole body , enough to feed my whole neighborhood .
my semi @-@ naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say it was my only option .
a few hours passed , which seemed to me like minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus mit dir , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted child : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and get away , you &apos;ll be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he bin@@ ds to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which had belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s family to escape from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ine ( such as : farmers ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their old @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed music .
with his music , which often deals with themes such as ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all of these topics are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not constra@@ ined by borders in his mind , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the disa@@ strous consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special a@@ version to American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b contem@@ plates his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation &quot; - he calls himself even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he po@@ urs in water dissolved N@@ es@@ café into two cups . it &apos;s the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; at this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness in breaking old traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the lu@@ gs speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the wa@@ v@@ ens of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose mainly of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially if you take a look at the neighbouring countries .
hence , it is easy to do basic things - like drinking water in public during Ram@@ adan - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the interior ministry Jord@@ ani@@ ens has cancelled a performance by the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual Fron@@ ts@@ kan@@ ers Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ ers contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the conc@@ ession of the concert .
the de@@ pu@@ ties and former spokes@@ men of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert had been cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation .
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which in@@ jects the well @-@ proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to &quot; opt for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement might not simply be plain rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zed reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned traditional gender standards by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust .
in the past few years , the number of &quot; hon@@ our@@ able mor@@ als &quot; has taken place in Jordan - the in@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honour points reached its cul@@ mination in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support the women victims of attempted murder or domestic violence .
according to a 1954 crime against crime , women who are exposed to the risk of in@@ tra @-@ family violence can &quot; be imprisoned at in@@ definite times in prison , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic expenditure and the family &apos;s guarantee are often necessary for the woman to do nothing .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from subjects that are long regarded as tab@@ oo in his country .
but H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was fed politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus again focuses on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse frequently repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which one , in his words , &quot; get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on gender equality have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to find out later that his comments were torn out of context , distorted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , it was stre@@ amed but only a revised version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b openly advoc@@ ates the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ i , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ evo , who was supposed to work later on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , has nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian realm , there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian intelligence service has taken several former members of the government and members of the teacher association , with the reason that they cri@@ tically critic@@ ised social media comment@@ aries about the problems related to corruption rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s concert is said to be only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has denied Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that &apos;s how H@@ da@@ i@@ b - is made up of slow , thought @-@ out and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs , of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is not only dre@@ aming of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will be approached by music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and democr@@ atically @-@ made demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore also resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
it is thought that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the festive carri@@ ages , the drums and the dancing have been handed over for more than a thousand years , in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region to force em@@ iss@@ uses to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 metre high fortress was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

seldom appearances and personal care were as important as in this story , as they help keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ style .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima &apos;s capital - a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ ies and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to more and more normal citizens in the hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has inspired even an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
experts face each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks from them , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions exist on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school of August@@ o Sal@@ azar , Bon@@ dy , who are located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to get training instead of bad advice in the bar@@ ber @-@ arts that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young@@ sters have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops prior to the school year beginning in March and reported some of their achievements :
in 1995 , we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children .
Colombia : love letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to accommodate affection towards people who feel dis@@ b@@ anded ?
this was precisely the question of the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga of the Bo@@ got@@ art Foundation and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation , and inspired them to the campaign of Cart@@ a p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ li@@ aci@@ ón ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
just recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to help their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace agreement with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces of Colombia ) , which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that Colum@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services .
before the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who had lived in illegal camps for many years , had been exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried on their arms around the clock , must now re@@ integrate themselves into civilian lives .
the Colom@@ bian society , which has grown accustomed to life in constant fear , and in some cases of deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take it into its ranks and support it in setting up a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would have to unite and help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back in society .
the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to speak briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this stated that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need much more .
he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed most urgent requests .
so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
up to now more than 2,000 letters have been collected within the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Mani@@ z@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought anyone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19 .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from Bo@@ got@@ á , travelled to the camp to deliver the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC presented themselves as they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and all that lies in between , &quot; said the political student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former war@@ rior led me through the camp of the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ gar@@ net , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
never before in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks .
I hu@@ gged him and set me next to the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of the war , was tired of being the faithful companion of this struggle for all the years , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I would never have thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society out there , waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now that peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
at the start , students and some of the F@@ ARC leaders came to a discussion group .
the students were all grown up as already there was war and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
therefore the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als , and gave an insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the State exer@@ ted itself on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the possibility to develop a political party , we can help shape society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear these people who have never heard of hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I have often seen and hated as monsters have been very painful for me , even people with beautiful feelings that have been turned around by their circumstances and their environment .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
for example , Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the following letter to Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i :
Colom@@ bians had been prophesi@@ ed that there would be peace after dis@@ arm@@ ament .
but this is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , healthcare and employment opportunities exist , there will always be people who are willing to resort to arms , rise and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call on all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the foundation of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

this is the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ ova and whose first publication was published on the website OC Media .
gay and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror activists have witnessed the coverage of the last few months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat which hangs over the LGB@@ T@@ Q community over the local LGB@@ T@@ Q community has not only emerged overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published dealing with the spread , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ as@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who arrested qu@@ eer men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
from her childhood she felt that she was really a woman .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced the gender balance of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
for fear of her life she moved to the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ con@@ cu@@ bine who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread her all over the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen Friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
then the pictures of my documents made the round by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on October 10 , 2015 I was attacked .
when I was just going to bring out a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a man &apos;s voice saying : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you dish@@ on@@ est ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not know the person .
I just know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had everything to get along and to scre@@ am .
the man fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I heard that I had two stab wounds in my right lung .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which health wings have you been placed - in which the men or the women ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
for that I am very grateful to him .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for his dis@@ respect .
I spent more than a month at the hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya in order to prove that it was all a lie .
they asked absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by running up without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in Gro@@ z@@ ny on the official television and say that I hadn &apos;t changed my sex , that everything was only bad talk , and Photos@@ hop .
I have particle size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people spoke to my mother on the street once .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has corrupted not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a rope around his neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later a car with dark@@ ened window pan@@ es and a license plate with a 95 on it stood under the window .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something rotten .
my human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without registration , without having to know anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
in the moment I wanted to call my m@@ um via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I received a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re safe , just because you left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you are in . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove it to you : it &apos;s the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about gender balance , that &apos;s a tab@@ oo topic .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this mental barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with the camera , I really try to look like the person she rec@@ alls from her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends doing , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who had sat in the gun for one and a half months .
he told that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that everyone could hardly wait for the end of Ram@@ adan , and he did not finish a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
that is what I mean , they probably charge the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : are gay men still held in these secret pris@@ ons ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there are not so many .
if , then above all , those who have no rich relations or who have been dropped by their relatives to put themselves at the court of Kad@@ y@@ rows .
as far as I know they are being held there so that they can later be presented as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ould they be killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people had not simply disappeared , but were deliberately immersed in order to be radic@@ alised .
OC Media : is this now just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have gone missing in this prison after their be@@ ard had grown .
there was nothing new about them ever since .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person himself was when these people were taken along .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think before 2003 I was already known all over Gro@@ z@@ ny when I was living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria applied , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia was originally intended to introduce us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civili@@ sation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had coloured eyel@@ ashes , wore tu@@ bular je@@ ans and short tops .
the Ministry of Safety of Sh@@ aria has never just cur@@ bed me a hair .
before the Russian theater in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
they often say it to children when they make fun of sick people .
OC Media : so they just shut their eyes off you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they have never offen@@ ded me , never ch@@ ased and never struck .
OC Media : how long did this time of grace last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long before Kad@@ y@@ row stepped on the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality in television .
he spoke not about us , but primarily about the behavior of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people began to change in the city .
those who had smil@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before looked at you at once with suspicion .
in that time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic deterior@@ ated steadily .
OC Media : what activity are you going to pursue right now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t spend a cent for it for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have discovered these people myself when I picked up a type of refuge .
I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ de@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that is sil@@ ly .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to make you white with foam in front of your mouth , that there are no bo@@ b@@ bin@@ s among them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dem@@ or@@ cists have the ones who have Kab@@ ard@@ iner , the Russians also have ; on the whole planet there are - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
you know , many think with transition identity to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact , different attitudes of life .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all because I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide among the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a strong increase of suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ ra@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he felt ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ ra@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video on YouTube kept the moments when he lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that occurred within the Arab region of Ah@@ ra@@ zi in August , and activists on the ground warn that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that a few others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ar@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have joined this month .
their stories have one thing in common : they were family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and pursue a safe work because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government .
Arab rulers suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a large part of the Ah@@ ra@@ zi River living in Iran is based , has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its livel@@ ihood .
a century ago , the Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi Mon@@ archy took power and in 1925 under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran .
in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran and some of the most productive and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy is still developing slowly , and the local population only gets little from that wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies Ah@@ ra@@ zi @-@ Arabs work@@ places in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the water from the Arabic areas to the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by d@@ rought , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ k young@@ sters rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Co@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , 55 % completed secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ zi Human Rights activ@@ ist resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic minorities in Ah@@ ra@@ z and anti @-@ Arab anti @-@ Arab anti @-@ Arab anti @-@ Arab anti @-@ Arab populations .
since officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , local Arab rulers are deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their living outside their hom@@ etown of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ ra@@ zi and so hired , since even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speak the Arabic language or wear Arab clothes .
given the circumstances that the Arab rulers have to endure , human rights activists h@@ itting alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism , nor with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot;
detail of a photo . taken by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Comm@@ ons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came out .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women respond - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , women nowadays still earn less money than men despite equal education .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and soci@@ etal standards still make sure that women come across a glass ceiling in various areas of life , and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still moving across the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all this is well known and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to speak on skin color , on black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used under ra@@ cial se@@ gregation and discrimination , many white fem@@ inists decide what kind of violence we have been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally .
but all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and to sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; in order to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin deserve less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background more often refer to school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all men , all men , and even all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to consider injus@@ tices in her mind , which relate to both sex and skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech in 18@@ 51 saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a detached and margin@@ alized entity in a historical sense . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I refuse to join forces who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation , in order to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c programme . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of the over@@ lap of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to teach them a better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and isol@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before , that we define black women according to our own ideas and place ourselves in the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of the book Afri@@ cana Past : claims for Africa ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) says that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also in this way create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , emotional , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I am recognized as a part of this paradig@@ m because of my dark skin and because of my being as a woman .
I , a black woman , can blossom in an environment where my life is neither b@@ yp@@ assed nor ignored nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that focuses on international efforts to solve environmental problems .
as part of a Content @-@ Sharing agreement , this article will be published again .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a particular concern of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no more water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist .
the focus of her work is on persecuted , poorly observed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of collaborative video and new multimedia techniques that help supp@@ ressed communities to tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Struc@@ tural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wis@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ ru@@ bin ) , which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a police inspec@@ tor told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had become violent against her .
a little time has passed since the end of her relationship and the police said her statement would be put to the file , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena for mal@@ treatment , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez &apos;s ac@@ coun@@ table ad did nothing .
a few days later , the second woman returned her display .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
in general , if women report a complaint at all , they generally do not receive any support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit being victims of violence must report to the law enforcement authorities .
In@@ halt@@ 1 Stri@@ kes and Statistics : 2 In@@ visible ill @-@ acts and a legal system that does not under@@ n@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , inadequate implementation impacts and statistics
it is hard to find out how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studio , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports that , however , do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay &quot; she explains .
however , the numbers available are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads participated in the District At@@ tor@@ ney &apos;s Office because of domestic violence . 70 % of these were violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the courts of peace . here , too , 86 % of women &apos;s ads came .
in the advertisements , 40 % of women said they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an minister of women Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for psychological abuse , there are 9 women who do not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman ref@@ unded by physical abuse , two women who do not do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the murder of women in Paraguay is not an independent crime , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 alone , journalists count at least 12 cases of murder in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to estimates , in Paraguay every ten days die due to violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that does nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she named him the name of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but after that she had to repent .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult identi@@ fiable :
I would never have thought that I would be victims of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happened to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote contributions on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos itself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had enjoyed it for so long and did not leave it earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that her former partner was ill @-@ treated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ o te Cre@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which consists of women , who are all victims of abuse in any way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the testim@@ onies of women seriously .
in Victoria &apos;s case , everything started with psychological abuse .
after all , her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Victori@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , she received no support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it led a trial against its former partner , who developed into an in@@ audi@@ ble legal struggle between Paraguay and its home country , in which it was mainly money , power and the influence of their former partner .
Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good but not applicable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ uses is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
a draft law was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament on 10 August 2016 , which was announced under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # for you ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ un@@ a@@ Men@@ os movement ( # non @-@ invasive ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original draft of the law proposes to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent crime and to punish har@@ sh@@ er as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legislative text was changed in a number of ways in order to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , fear@@ ing that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is banned , which is currently banned in Paraguay and pun@@ ish@@ able by up to five years imprisonment .
the initial draft plan had fores@@ een most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence need to carry out at present themselves if they just want to report and receive a safe accommodation to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as a part of inter @-@ human relations .
a re@@ thinking must take place here , so that violence is no longer considered normal .
whoever is silent about these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the perpet@@ rators of crime .
we have to report as long as mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been altered , including a passage which the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
opinions on the changes diver@@ ge .
the Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation section was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
the presentation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great back@@ lash .

independent media in Oman a year after ban on a newspaper continues to be attacked
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a resolution of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is read on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Brazilian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tan .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he is serving a year @-@ old prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and brought to trial , but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he dis@@ missed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , alongside his role as the only Sultan , he is the chief executive in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the rule of the Sultan is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , to restrict civil liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , and to torture , in@@ timi@@ date and in@@ sti@@ gate human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
the authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to freely express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its founding in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) it was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested after an article appeared in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 with the title &quot; High @-@ ranking parties tied hands of justice . &quot; it was about corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in court decisions .
in the report , government officials were accused of pressur@@ ing judges of the Supreme Court of Oman to susp@@ end a verdict in an inheritance case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties bind the hands of justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the editorial committee , was invited by the ISS ahead of the special department and arrested by security forces upon his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS elected deputy chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the paper in any way , including online , is banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place before the trial in Mas@@ k@@ at .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , inter alia , for disrup@@ ting public order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ mining of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of a violation of the prohibition of publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3,000 om@@ ania Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one @-@ year professional ban against the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of making use of &quot; an information network to distribute material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a security deposit of 5,000 om@@ ania Ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was fixed and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the pron@@ ounc@@ ement of the sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following the release of his six @-@ month jail sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison where he is serving his imprisonment sentence .
the Appe@@ als Chamber also rev@@ oked the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the Az@@ am@@ n Newspaper .
despite the decision of the Court to recover Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Brazilian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closure of Az@@ am@@ n by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further order in which the closure of Az@@ am@@ n was prolonged for three additional months and with which the minister once again lod@@ ged an appeal against the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to re@@ press the publication of the newspaper .
the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the paper are not the only cases in which the press freedom has been viol@@ ated in Oman in recent times .
other violations include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ at@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper .
due to the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression arises that the Japanese authorities are still not ready to end the extensive violation of press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Afgh@@ an authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
2. to create a secure environment for the Az@@ am@@ n Newspaper so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have been able to exercise their legitimate rights of human rights without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries through the promotion of freedom of expression and association , as well as the right to peac@@ efully gather , support and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture taken with his agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases like AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious implications in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
second , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( CI@@ DR@@ Z ) at the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia .
in the 1990s he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic was the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus , before deciding to go back home to support the Serbian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media about this research .
( disc@@ laim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rior RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I am also starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GM : what do you think are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always stay on the receiver instead of being a do@@ er .
the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are promoted in different ways .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because funding and development chances are better in other countries .
GV : how is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory equipment is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already an interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : what is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , space exploration , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the US to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about possible solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding a salad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ ra@@ geous , the first plant which has been grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ tons &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many types of salads he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding .
the patents used not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green ton or cur@@ led leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cer@@ eal or board types . due to these trends , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton is still breeding a salad , but he needs longer since his work is more and more difficult due to ever increasing restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if a b@@ oul@@ der in a river is lying around which I have to jump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when they stand before the court , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot; he goes on as well as possible and tries to breed the characteristics he wants .
however , it is very careful and endeav@@ ours to not use any material protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is becoming ever bigger in the United States and all over the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman salad of the sort Out@@ ra@@ geous in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the station . there it is tested if plants can be grown in space . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been established to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are therefore permanently usable for plant bree@@ ders .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bree@@ ders can undertake to freely use the seed bred by them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bree@@ ders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties , and not immediately cut them out - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014 .
dark views on the horizon
for the Emer@@ itus Professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seeds and the ability to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds play a role in greater cohesi@@ on such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would attempt to use the latter not or only little by bred seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg points out that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not dealing with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grains , genetically modified or not , from organic agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seeds , &quot; he says , and takes account of the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry , whose recent examples are the mer@@ gers of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Bayer , which , for example , are offered on farmers markets , should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to helping others to keep their seeds available free of charge , as opposed to pat@@ enting seeds and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk because the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore increasingly available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all cart@@ on characteristics are protected as intellectual property , making it usable for plant bree@@ ders either at all or just terri@@ bly usable .
for other plants , there are still no such estimates , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that widely grown plants such as wheat are still more patented than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are grown so that they have targeted desirable characteristics - from those that enhance their taste or colour right up to those due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bree@@ ders is decreasing due to more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much less predictable by climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokesperson Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknowled@@ ges that genetic diversity is generally important and decisive for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
however , it contradic@@ ts the opinion that intellectual property uses other bree@@ ders since &quot; patents and protection of plant varieties encourage innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow once the patent has expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method .
such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees this differently : wait 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly sponsors no innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to be able to breed plants adapted to the changing environmental conditions , you have already lost the fight .
the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want farmers to facilitate their work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us forward , and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in all , Mor@@ ton is interfer@@ ing with the concept of pat@@ enting plant characteristics : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form themselves and as bree@@ ders , we finally have no idea how plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Caro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety also breeds his own values in them .
anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for whose cultivation it is needed mass her@@ bi@@ cides , breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is absolutely opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create the most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton looks for salads in his breeding garden .

Mor@@ ton is also convinced that bree@@ ders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks as if I have been using my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties themselves in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is protected against competition for 20 years , which makes it very easy in my opinion . &quot; worldwide resonance
although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . to preserve the seed of traditional plant varieties , the Centre is working with farmers and helps them breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Organization Agre@@ col works on an open source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s commitment to bree@@ ders in the European Union .
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , so O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s obligation cannot simply be taken one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus it contradic@@ ts the current practice of the European Patent Office which permits patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a declaration is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards seed pat@@ enting .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for Open Source seed systems explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for which the official starting signal is to be launched next year .
a merger of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , published a report from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . it believes that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , exchange , and improve seed policy to ensure stable food supply .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by from O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon see him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has focused mainly on where and how something is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly ever played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people realize that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest cens@@ orship goals in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government locked up the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents violations of human rights in Egypt and the Arab world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August published the Network an Opinion on Facebook in which it sharply critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue work and efforts on human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains pale in spite of this attack and the der@@ ision of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are actually defending the law to uph@@ old the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the block@@ age and not surrender . we ins@@ ist on fulfilling our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered to be the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar @-@ based network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of the wave of website locks to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arab language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to the blog posted by the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dis@@ semination of columns and articles that he writes for web pages and media in@@ accessible to Egypt .
now the blog , which he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , was even the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider that is also home to Zi@@ pp &apos;s blog , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video as the police practiced physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve mainly around policy and human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada said to the ban by the government and reflected what this meant for him :
blocking blo@@ gs is very old but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even though blocking the blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It was successful for them to give me the feeling of a siege ; arrest , attempted murder , sum@@ m@@ ons at the National Security Council , blocking blo@@ gs as well as any other web site I worked for .
2 ) You proved that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have an influence on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
at first I used to post articles in order to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship .
but now that they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the courageous go the way until the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests in networks of different Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and ET@@ IS@@ A@@ LA@@ T .
af@@ te also documented the block@@ age of providers through the b@@ ypass of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offered began .
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that could have access to Egyptian users .
the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the decision @-@ making decisions are taken behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can prec@@ ede judgment against these acts .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ orship and who will it next attack ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants struggle .

day after day , newspapers in the whole of Brazil reported mur@@ ky head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the country &apos;s second @-@ largest city and home to numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves ro@@ b Phar@@ m@@ acy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers to the army , nav@@ y and air@@ waves to Rio . &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these are com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
for detailed reporting on violence in Rio , the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 published the Editorial &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crimes , etc . everything that happens by civili@@ zed standards and what only happens in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : it &apos;s not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper said that this decision was not a cause for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist writes that according to the Institute for Internal Security Studies in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 sites controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues to write :
we are aware that a war dis@@ courses , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police who first shoot and then ask questions to cover up .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; does the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harm more than it benefits ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence is a &quot; war . &quot; this is , in their opinion , a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult for the police to account for responsibility .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ pleasing negl@@ ect of public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital .

describe Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the murder rate per state , Rio will be in place 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , is one of the biggest media companies in South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ a@@ ora ) , a police unit ordered by the federal state of Rio in 2003 , was one of these security policy measures , with the aim of capturing a fav@@ ela by using a massive police custody order and permanently station@@ ed there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decline of violent deaths . however , after several years , the U@@ PP has been increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities who were supposed to protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 , explaining why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention , for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio serves as war also serious consequences for the people after themselves .
for this requires the state to use resources and ways typical of war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot;
war going or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the F@@ av@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
a week ago , the police cleared the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ ar@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident made head@@ lines : a res@@ eller died as a result of shots that the police had fired from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by Assad &apos;s regime towards loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently about one million Syrians in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b in a state of siege .
the Ost Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 required hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege , which led to the fact that the inhabitants are dependent on locally made or through tunnels and control points .
through the years of block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics will teach the inhabitants of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; food @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food quality makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the direct of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because you can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that has been fighting for three years to introduce this project and expressed his relief that it is gaining more and more publicity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to earn money for the initiative , the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do is used in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to provide 125 families with knowledge of the planting of mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , September 4th 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of mushrooms coming from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before checking their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom grav@@ eyard in a tub . when this was done , they used a larger bath tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i throughout Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source in the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc . ) for the extraction of new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities bound to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege becomes visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and that we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the interview with Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la was conducted by Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b and translated by Elias A@@ bo@@ u Ja@@ ou@@ de .
Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested on October 21 in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires ra@@ ging in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two persons died and around 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government &apos;s last week of solidarity with victims for 3 days .
bran@@ dies were also registered in the Gali@@ cian region of Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire bur@@ sts spread in northern and central regions of the country , reaching about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite ima@@ gery , in 2017 alone , about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest were burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
all Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017

numerous videos spread across the net and show images that allow better insights into what happened :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the protests on Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why the civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as much as possible .
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al of the Federation of farmers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this : there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened in June as the streets were blocked very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal for the wh@@ ale form introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was critici@@ zed by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed the construction activity to fall , if the applicant had a means of self @-@ defence - that was an open back door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees of easily inflamm@@ able wood , behave like in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this kind .
in addition to these problems , the website of Portugal &apos;s Civil Defence on October 15th and 16th , when citizens sought information or attempted to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it used fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt &apos;s own civil protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial at this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers stopped the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed fires : the website counted more than half a million requests .
even the Fo@@ under asked for help :

the way from Afghanistan to a successful entrepren@@ eur

one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan by the Tali@@ ban began .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government , and Afghanistan became a land of terror and despair .
exactly at that time A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belonged to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , spent the last time together with his family at dinner in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan .
even though his mother didn &apos;t say it at that time , she knew that she would no longer see her son - maybe even more .
at dawn the boy was supposed to break .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been assass@@ inated by the Tali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara felt un@@ fail@@ ingly suddenly .
the Tali@@ ban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came ever closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was hard and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran . once again , he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and tow@@ ed sacks with mort@@ ars , heavier than himself , to earn his livel@@ ihood .
at that time , like today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really tough , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ k rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows , so that we did not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island of Greece .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ k returned to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ k was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid needy twice a day .
it is true that due to relatively high twin quot@@ as , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers . it is also true that the conditions for asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special recording centers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially filed an application for asylum - which can go on for months after the asylum seek@@ er has been registered .
until then , people who do not have money for accommodation can either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ k .
but his un@@ restra@@ ined li@@ king helped A@@ shar@@ k to come out of these conditions soon .
after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ k put his whole savings into the creation of a hostel in Venice .
this went so well that after a while , he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar .
A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to the official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries .
in recent years some Afgh@@ an @-@ owned businesses , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Peace &amp; amp restaurant in Pad@@ ua ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na Pizzeria in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s goals reach far beyond the Italian gastronomic trade and retail and go back to the country , which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know my people are suffering .
I plan to plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces in the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ k also for@@ fei@@ ts plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can sell their crop hits on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development to a successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ k has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
N@@ eti@@ zen report : bill dra@@ fts from Egypt allow dis@@ connection of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in detention .
he reported on the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo that prot@@ ested against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys N@@ eti@@ zen Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament checks a draft bill suggest@@ ing that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registering with a governmental authority .
users must register in order to be able to use social networks within six months following a successful legislative decision on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and identity number .
those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months &quot; imprisonment or a penalty of punishment .
the Act , which has been applied by sixty members of parliament , is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another member of the Parliament filed a proposal to introduce tough@@ er sanctions for the insul@@ t of the President or a senior official .
under the law proposition , such a crime would , however , be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted .
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photograph@@ ed Egyptian polic@@ emen while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators fighting against the military coup that led to the inauguration of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
as more than 700 prot@@ esters who had been arrested during the same incident , Sha@@ w@@ kan waited four years in prison for a trial date .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison management , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the accused from prison into the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan faces the death penalty due to a number of human rights groups , including mis@@ sile defense , illegal gathering , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in Gi@@ za acqu@@ itted the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ sad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pun@@ ish@@ ments of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested during the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activists listen to le@@ aked documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ating Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia has mainly been inter@@ ro@@ gated to a vigor@@ ous action plan . said plan comes from the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , endor@@ ses a controversial draft bill that would warrant to business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided they return all un@@ law@@ fully received mon@@ ies .
the document published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at on 21 April sheds light on how the presidential plans to support the bill of legislation look like .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia re@@ jects the designation of its sources by stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which provides journalists with the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he was a witness in the District Court of Tunis on May 9th as a witness .
will China force the users of social media to present their ID ?
according to new regulations of the Information Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission before writing or sharing messages in social media .
the regulations also indicate that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts expect that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these provisions .
Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to en@@ force these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
then do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat ? &quot;
not in Russia !
in May state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat has failed to register as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organis@@ er of the information distribution &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organise the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing contents and to force them on request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites are currently comprised of websites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ plac@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , Mail@@ .@@ R@@ u e @-@ mail service and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has Wiki@@ pedi@@ as blocking
a Turkish court ordered Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to clear two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication addressed the site being blocked because it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co@@ operates with groups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to join a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked our website . it is , besides , among others , China , one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain can &apos;t stop sni@@ ff@@ ing around
after this week of le@@ aked documents , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers , which would force internet service providers to monitor communication in real time and install Backdoor programs that dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services regarding the proposal but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation will continue until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be passed on to the Ministry of the Interior .
