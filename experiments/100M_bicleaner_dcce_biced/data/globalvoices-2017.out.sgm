<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and practiced its sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous plot of an oil-magnate, who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to show his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free after Method Man," "" "I was as if it is absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona was only heightened by my admiration for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very shameful love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me, as he is dealing with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">With his opinion he never stops behind the mountain, as you say so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague puts it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted for him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican primaries was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever achieved.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme that receives people from all over the world, a deeply believer person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps, too, did not agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the current publisher of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who has been fighting the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with much patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leaks, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values represented by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump made his way to nominate Republican presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly whites, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt towards non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people have voted for drunkenness, because they either shared their racism and fanaticism or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump-voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is superficial and disrespectful and incapable of understanding those who act and think differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom know, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say they are still important in America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commented on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt upon those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (note D. Ü): as much as "the revolt of the whites against all other ethnicities"; word play from white in allusion to the whites and whiplash, which means so much as the great Van Jones, has exactly killed what America has done so splendidly.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have, America is welcome everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president twice the son of a Kenyman whose history as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, with the election of Donald Trumps, a huge part of the white American promises this promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "No!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices became louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if someone who is not like you, would have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" "" "thank God, Mr. Trump, that is not your America." "" "36 hours later he was rectified." ""</seg>
<seg id="59">The country for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And it breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca have in common with the children of the Paraguaan town of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played in both places, not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, just 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding it with its musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its abuse of drugs and bananas.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and thus offered a rare hope for hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with gleaming eyes and play in the buzz you learn day by day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga to play.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments made up of local solid waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments under the leadership of Favio Chávez.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music, as well as music from the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article from the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the beginning time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something he had never seen before: a violin made from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra playing on instruments made of reprocessed material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary named "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic waste dump) characterises the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of trash every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like men in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmony follows the orchestra with its inspiring performance from trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can effectively fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Voices for the joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa at that time it was known that this ship had already used illegal fishing in the Liberian waters before it sought the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were upset and reluctant to welcome a criminal of this type on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give it a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that just refused everything," "" "remembers Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan Fisheries Authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at the time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: he was unable to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay $2 million in Liberia, because of pillage of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which intersects criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 launched by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that the prime minister had driven out of their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and help each other when it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is by definition unregulated: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate disregard of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, can harm the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also through the snail stamp, with which information circulated between individual countries, the actions happen nowadays in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, for example, news about suspicious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas. also, suspicious running routes can be discovered - such as suggesting that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such tests can show whether the involved vessels have a fishing license where they were on the way and possibly also whether they have a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse acceptance of such ships in their ports based on this information, meaning that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "there are considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile any more." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm advocating for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The previously mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue, which the eight members of the network HISH-i lose every year due to illegal fishing, which enter into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East-Africa has one of the most productive tuna-fisheries, therefore the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among them also these illegal fishing fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include, among other things, actions such as sailing under false flag, counterfeit license papers, indication of fantasies, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an uninterrupted control system," "" "Long." "" "a ship could fish illegally and a country could say" "" "You can't run my harbor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "and that is exactly what FISH-i tries to close." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Up to now the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found fleeing ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to his cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over great distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system that is constantly being developed helps to track down the illegal ships that like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishing boats use very clever techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, head analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fishery data and provides technical support with FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems, for example, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it should help FISH-i to find criminal-acting ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations really influence this unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">SkyTruth has recently opened Global Fishing Watch's Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the ocean protection organization Oceana: a platform that provides satellite data and displays the position of each tracking vessel around the world.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities don't only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that had been fished without a license and had little consequences, now know they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i are now seeing a 33% increase in fishing turnover, since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to detect Greko 1, the inspectors found tow nets where they were banned.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "Kiilu says." "" "we are a study object." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015 six countries joined together, to the West Africa Task Force so called West Africa Task Force. they are also fighting illegal fishing according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. "With certainty, the aim is to let even more such initiatives and structures arise in other regions," states Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's most recent member country Somalia has been able to announce its first great triumph: in October, there was Greko 1, a ship under false flag. and not only was the ship on the way without a license, and were used towing nets that are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also imbued into forbidden waters reserved for fishers from Somalia." "" "with the conduct of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong signal that they go against illegal fishing," "" "Bergh says." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative working method for protecting the oceans actually works across the world ocean. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>

<seg id="153">The street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered to be a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government rejected the opposition's request for a referendum on a referendum, the Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emptiness by gathering on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuelan (for example: the recovery of Venezuela) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate will also be held in other parts of the country, including in the lowland area of Barinas, in the regions Mérida and Táchira, in the central north of Carabobo and Isla Margarita in the state Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country is worsening continuously, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition have seen the chance of a fundamental change in the opening of the current President Nicolás Maduro, but ultimately blocking a re-election was blocked by official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, co-acting with Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government decision:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation and violence rate is one of the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated to be 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum was considered to be the only way to give the country the chance to recapture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or briefly MUD (for example: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together, called on the proceedings against President Nicolás Maduro. "in addition, a twelve-hour strike on the following day and a march to Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government, should continue to persist.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It's as far as Venezuela: morning National Assembly, Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3 all to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="177">Particularly large waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators moved back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statements in front of the police and armed proponents of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop the police, including this woman in the Andenstaat Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira do not wear skirts because otherwise one could see something that many national Guards do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic is already making the round that reflects the amount of suppression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship oppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for a term of office - this has now been proved in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="189">Others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that, from their point of view, undertook little against the devastating economic crisis and preferred to refrain from breaking critical voices:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">Marches grow more and more in frequency and intensity.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 at Día a Día, an Argentinean news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean town of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult, Quijano now spoke against his father as part of the great La Perla Ribera trial in the province of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military installations at the Prison of La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept his family secret.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I believed that was alright.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child at the age of 15, you don't notice that you are manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time, I could not realize that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis was no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmermaid. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the intelligence department 141 in the prison La Perla from 1976 to 1978.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Records of the archive.</seg>
<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor, who is accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of the atrocities he had witnessed as a boy, and who testified before a Federal Constitutional Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows the great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose for himself a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there, I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him Kent.</seg>

<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You're an asshole, you've been friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Just be careful not to kidnap you one day and I have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo, a revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of Argentina's revolutionary workers "party.</seg>
<seg id="223">That is why he forbade me to go back to the sports hall. a few days later, he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would become a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. for so my father had educated me.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the military base I had to wipe out papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all sorts of documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simply everything.</seg>

<seg id="235">That day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen objects were put down and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured there.</seg>
<seg id="238">I peed inside and saw a couch being tortured on humans.</seg>

<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original picture by Joshua Levine, which has been widely shared in social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>

<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older motorists. according to the police, the proportion of older motorists, who are involved in accidents throughout the country, gives reasons for concern." ""</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: a passive language knowledge to understand the source text and take active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - should not be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ any staff with English as their mother tongue, which could produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees themselves can still make translations company-internal. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worshiped and enigmatic sentences that arise through mechanical translations show that this technique can't replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English wordings in Japan, including the enigmatic imprints often adorning t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery. however, careful translations from large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more reliable source for its translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they would not have access to the Vivoplay online station.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the websites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online stations also carried out recordings of the protests in Caracas, which were organized by oppositional groups who oppose the government Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests commenced at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the connection was tied, and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Censorship: enable your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are once again locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the @ VivoPlayNet site.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. back then, the Telecoms Commission threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw it as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national television channels, I have registered at @ vivoplaynet again.</seg>
<seg id="403">Amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two liters of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEIT later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online stations. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transmits its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Prior research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technology through which the DNS servers respond to requests of certain domains correctly.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server replies or refuses the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS-lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">VPITV, a third blocked channel, was discontinued on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who survived the protests in Caracas live, was put into custody.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten, while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went to broadcast again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates internet connections: this makes Venezuelans more and more difficult to access multimedia reporting on current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("Flying cows, falling schools"), edited and re-released by Global Voices of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "she said," "" "What has become of something?" "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga never was treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began to work as a Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, in Paraguay there are more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers her underage son or her underage daughter to another, richer family. in exchange, the child receives food, an apprenticeship and a roof over her head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned here, however, is that the children have to spend countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can become - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice, described as Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization struggling for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke to Criaditas - particularly young girls were affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated by the Criaditas guarantees in general silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, which is their daughter in the belief that they complete their training, improve their position in society and "make something out" can be transferred to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who takes the girl with herself and justifies its exploitation by believing that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise be no training and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl becomes ill-treated, his family will learn from it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>

<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín came to the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of violent blows. shortly after she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military staff Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira hit Marín as long as she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed the fact that the murdered child was a critita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF and Callescuela made the practice of Criadazgo rooted in the Paraguayan society responsible for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there be "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"" "" "" "more cows are registered in Paraguay" "", "Tina Alvarenga complained." ""</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children unpunished.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for rapid investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for the murder of the girl who was her Crikta.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín may be trend-setting - for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes to court.</seg>

<seg id="455">The Criadians are exploited not only as labour forces, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work all the way and began selling candy on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita into the capital of Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">Alvarenga worked in the house of her employer between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">In doing so, she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose up against five o'clock in the morning and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays, for instance, cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner it was done with learning, the more free time it had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but also didn't have unlimited food. "I needed to get more books from the house library than food from the fridge," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well-equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party who belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">At some evenings the host Alvarenga forced to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition lines like Sendero or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to persuade her not to believe in the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">"" "he kept them intelligent, but did not think about it." "" "the host had found someone who listened while he talked about politics," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="472">"they didn't often allow me to visit my family because they felt that I would again learn" bad habits "there." they said that Alvarenga, who belongs to the Indigenous group of Guarani, would again speak their native language Guaraní back home.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made for her, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them, with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in school, Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing almost never talked about is bullying and the harassment exposed to Criaditas when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a crileita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anybody home. I didn't have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time when friendships arise, I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group.</seg>

<seg id="483">Hello! I am looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon.</seg>

<seg id="487">The ad received five "Likes" and many comments.</seg>

<seg id="500">Image of Pixabay, modified by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Posted under Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary delegates recently voted in favour of a draft law on "the regulations concerning the use and benefits of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "" "" "if it is adopted by the Parliament, users and users of social media in Egypt must be registered with a government agency in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter." ""</seg>
<seg id="504">"" "" "" "on the basis of the law there would be a place set up to give citizens permission to use social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months of adopting the law, users must register on the site of the site with their correct names and identity numbers in order to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, it could take a penalty of up to six months of imprisonment or a loss of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs and is used over the Internet to communicate with others by voice, video and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is adopted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose the registration. unclear is also how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, MP and supporter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users received a username and password from the telecommunications department "to get through the firewall blocking Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known until now that such plans exist.</seg>

<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that as they violently control physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take it seriously, it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens that apply for approval or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "" "" "in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft is in line with a pro-military mindset in parliament, in whose sense the control will be maximized and ensured that no dissenting narration is present on the image surface, "says Raoof.</seg>

<seg id="524">This article by Todd Reubold was published in the original on Ensia.com, a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions.</seg>
<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the north-east of Iraq, the animal rights activist Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the NGO Nature Iraq are working on protecting the ghostly Persian leopard.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the leopards that roamed through Africa and Asia are among the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor). in total, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered because of poaching, loss and fragmentation of their habitat and as they always find less loot.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows up in the video," "" "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish eco-system" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that there is a big predator." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the free wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera all, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist Raza passionately likes to show a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">Since 2013, it has also been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group and advocates that protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan region are established.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>

<seg id="544">Early March 2017 documented the progress made for the northeast of Japan, Kahoku Shimpo, the progress that has been achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. a huge earthquake, a tsunami and an atomic accident in Fukushima had triggered the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was one of several prefectures in Japan's northeast that had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced to flee, for the tsunami had let entire coastal towns disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition to this, Fukushima prefecture experienced an atomic accident, for this alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows, from a local point of view, the progress achieved six years later in order to rebuild the life of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and the survey results of those affected.</seg>
<seg id="550">Apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned substitute buildings were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to record the biggest success among the three prefectures, and 80 percent of the planned spare houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses while Fukushima accounts for 70 percent of the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, one still endeavours to relocate to final spare houses six years after the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the Fukushima evacuated in 2011 still live in emergency shelters whereas Miyagi was more successful on this occasion. more than 75 percent of the evacuated who lived after the disaster in temporary shelters were resettled to final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1,100 schools affected by disaster have reopened their gates until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are in operation again, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident suffered extensively in the three prefectures of agrarian land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 per cent of destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland of Fukushima are in the "nuclear blackout zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima is still lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo paper also reports that since the disaster nearly half of the coastal residents, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to obtain a general picture, the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and the evacuation. she asked her about the state of reconstruction and how her empathy has changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction, the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed said that disaster prevention has not yet been done enough.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is for those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In her issue for the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has focused its attention on the situation of the evacuation from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima Prefecture was also a witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160,000 evacuation from Fukushima nearly 63 thousand people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 some more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been resettled in permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand still 40000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In disaster areas, most of the evacuation companies still live in shelters, older than 50 years old, are well known because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima must compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people come across from other countries speaking a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often sees that one connects more than it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global links are important, as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look closely at these global links. in our Into the Deep Podcast we handle issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members remembering a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Kriconi talks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how the love of music overcame her affection for Iranian culture; Adriana Macias tells about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week: last Friday, a police officer had killed him during a demonstration in Goiânia with a headstock against his head. nationwide, millions of demonstrators participated in a protest march against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studies social sciences at the University of Goiás, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on him on Saturday and transferred him to an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer, who attacked with a strike. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás reported that Sampaio had been suspended until the investigation of the incident was suspended by the active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer, as he strikes in Goiânia with his stick on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be seen on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desnealizador," a press channel by media activists from Goiânia, shared the video filmed by Luiz da Luz, in which one sees Mateus being attacked by the police officer and several paramedics hasten shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from a different perspective, is also filmed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus living in another state, Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilians (about 2,700 Euro) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and allow his family to stay in Goiânia while lying in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado recalls more attacks against activists in Goiás:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás has witnessed a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilherme Irish was assassinated by his father, because he had been sabotaging the Occupy movement in secondary schools. here, the military police of a WhatsApp group had been sabotaged only to decriminalize teachers, and here we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a police officer who struck him with a stick on his face.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police Handles</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to brutal police operations against demonstrators last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Policemen settled in protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had set up a stage for orators, rubber bullets and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The deputy, Flavio Serafini, the Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstrators via loudspeaker announcements.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media have covered street protests by directing the focus on another, unexpected protagonist: a window screen.</seg>
<seg id="620">The folks of São Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo deliberately reported about a broken glass window to decorate their front pages illustratively with a photo.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, O Globo preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window pane as about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be recognised if one is strictly against any kind of damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here, too, the term "vandalism" obtains an absurd, disproportionate significance, and the typical acts of violence in the military police are covered by headlines with the title "protesters on confrontation with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">The Uncharted Villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane mills in the whole of Cuba closed doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding that there is no notable sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane mills were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the fall, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories that still ground.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, who stands up every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region, which are in operation after a long inactive period because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers carefully that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad administration decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production was 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but bad harvests are no longer a news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the community saw even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated and barely competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">But the sugar price rose again a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars between 15 and 16 Centavos needs to remain per pound, according to the 2016 report by the OECD and FAO, the Agricultural and Food Organisation of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production reached the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years there was a shutdown of 98 sugar cane mills, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "if Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about closing the factory, is the word he repeats most," "" "fraud." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all those surveyed said the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time workgroup.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first leap year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was a matter of officially written documents that would differ only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All of them were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was overhauled and the letters were getting more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut-down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane mills that were still in operation," he affirms.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, is waiting for retirement in another plant, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the shutdown of the factory, in whose construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 working years.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities throughout Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do it using Hip-Hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youngsters songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by Pedagogic David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in Northern Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is thus increasing that young participants in conversations like "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance," or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the US state Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a street section in Western Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs were published in Indigenous Languages, although the youngsters do not always rule the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved received some help from Gary Jolly of the Northstars hip-hop group who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcript, as well a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as a youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and also go ahead with our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what she decreed for the Creator</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, they are presented by each dish that is served in this restaurant near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (of course, of course, "plastic models of the dishes").</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether to enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi there are a lot of these small companies that have just made those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are usually not even noticeable. however, a new trend now turns them into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">With Naver Matome the blogger wrote a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special store: new mobile phone belts decorated with plastic ribbons as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were turned into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in essences is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an orphan-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that keeps your mobile battered:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there someone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my cell phone with salmon roe?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our newest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and wristbands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further whimsical plastic dishes can be viewed at: itinii's Naver Matomblog post. or follow the hashtag # as well as the #!!</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "Apring a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "learning to live with drug trafficking"), which aims to give these victims a voice and tells stories of people who were fighting in the fight between the law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project like this:</seg>

<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with illness and sensationalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from files of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the composure.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only person who is disgusted or sad. it seems like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he wants to become a Narco (German: drug trafficker) when he is big. and it's not normal for people to hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the futility of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were" "" "soaking up" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies, if they don't stir and stand still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post "Four months blackmail in the main city district": how a family was plundered with threats. "this describes how armed criminals squeezed money from their business for month until they end up destroying not only the business, but also broke their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes, the trauma remains, fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>

<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days whether wines would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega released the article" "" "Uncharted Children of Ciudad Juárez: a Generation of Violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How about growing up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age whose parents care about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, sown potatoes, make tortillas warm, and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, saw the bloody body of his father, shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, as a result of organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Citizens Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the Prosecutor's Office amounted to 3103 murders.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories live in the face of ever-new headlines. but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Apring a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político 2015 launched the data journalism project Narcodata whose objective is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tormented the country over the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact-check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rumor or exposing a falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the year after something has appeared the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this picture of a terrible accident at the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) seven years ago.</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been misleading to see tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures on news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker traversed the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people lost their lives.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected and devastated for years. the streets in the region became dangerous roads full of potholes, which were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tanker fell victim to this.</seg>
<seg id="828">The official representative described a fireball, which enveloped dozens of houses including a movie theater near, which was full of people who watched the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture entitled "This is Nigeria." from Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident depict the grayful scenes of the day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are strung on the floor while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo has been recorded several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters from Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses drastically reported atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one stayed behind to count dead," "" "said one inhabitant to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be depicted figuratively.</seg>
<seg id="844">The attack was also unclear, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt by Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo showed up again, as it was falsely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of misappropriations; Africa Check has documented assignments in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as a cover for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments such as this example falsely relate the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to supply arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the killing of the Rohingya Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash report published by the United Nations, those who could flee could strike, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against the Rohingya, posts appeared like the following which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This image comes from an Saudi Arabian news site that falsely claimed that President Myanmar's Thein had said that monks and politicians had participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (frameworks) that push through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence associated with the assassination of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the assassination of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Understanding religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media there are tens of people who inadvertently have a share of drinking water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and belittens the actual horror of what happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent pictures has already been comprehensively debated (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, there is concern that violent pictures will sensitize readers and viewers and take the ability to empathize empathy (such as this study investigating how violent media work to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss with regard to violent portrayals in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used detached from the context or in a completely abusive manner.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, each examination of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo by Andy Simmons used according to CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. invincible) strives to provide language enthusiasts with a selection of words from all over the world which are difficult or not to be translated at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these invaluable words are already well-known (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (such as the Spanish Sobraesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find for example words from the Tap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- thank you for your parents in recognition of how they have been working for you in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The convenience or laziness you feel after you've been warming up in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defuse other cultures, reveal different thoughts and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify linguists on this page want to publish even more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive are these small languages.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of "Treasure Languages" which are highly appreciated by untranslatable are invited to upload their favorite words here.</seg>

<seg id="971">Triggered by the monsoon, which normally ends at the end of May, the rivers Kalu, Kelani, Gin, Nilwala and Attanagalu Oya have come across the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country.</seg>
<seg id="972">After an opinion of the disaster center of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017, 126 people were killed and almost 100 people were missed because of the floods and mud winds.</seg>
<seg id="973">More than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and around 100,000 people were brought to 304 reliable residences.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rain falls gradually on Saturday (27 May) and the water levels in some areas slowly declined.</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still inaccessible areas.</seg>
<seg id="976">The following pictures and videos convey an impression of the scale of the flood disaster:</seg>
<seg id="977">Flood waters in Tawalama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters. Twitter users like Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka Tweet deliver regular updates to the flood situation.</seg>

<seg id="980">This morning the Neluwa Bus stood in the flood, water level of up to 6 meters. the village of Moragoda near Galle is also flooded due to the water pegels of the Morogoda Ela.</seg>
<seg id="981">The Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and another five are made for the transport of emergency supplies to the residents enclosed in their flooded villages.</seg>
<seg id="982">Various organizations and startups have also agreed to help.</seg>
<seg id="983">Facebook pages like Help Flood Victims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Disaster Relief - information desk- Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian assistance.</seg>

<seg id="987">Please call 0777449729 or 0777843841 if you need help in this area.</seg>
<seg id="988">The taxi call app PickMe (Sri Lanka) asks anxious people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the cadastophencentre is informed.</seg>
<seg id="989">Last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Roanu, PickMe introduced a "flood control" button that allowed users to call for a vehicle to pick up assistance and donate. they were then forwarded to the Sri Lankan Red Cross free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="990">They also launched an "SOS" button, which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by floods and landslides.</seg>
<seg id="991">The combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka in which several social media platforms are fully exploited bring residents in need of security and provide assistance.</seg>
<seg id="992">This has prevented the loss of other human lives, whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normalcy.</seg>

<seg id="1002">I have already managed this conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1003">People with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sahar they know - from the widespread concept of "Muslims" that have built up in their imagination.</seg>
<seg id="1004">You have to get rid of me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't look all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves with being a Muslim, in a different way. but somehow we are all plugged into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims, who do not fit in there, will be devised.</seg>
<seg id="1010">Demicilization will be</seg>
<seg id="1011">I am not alone with that.</seg>
<seg id="1012">This is even happened to the poet, whose poetry is most sold in America: Rumi.</seg>

<seg id="1014">Love?</seg>
<seg id="1015">Peace?</seg>
<seg id="1016">When Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I am now, he was an Orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day when he died.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the Western imagination, Rumi's religion was erased, as was the most popular translation of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deleting makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another is in the reductionist images of Muslims that have been colonising Western books for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">This enticing imagery is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save.</seg>
<seg id="1022">The groundbreaking Palestinian-American scientist Edward Said destroyed the story behind these images in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="1023">But these pictures still protrude today.</seg>
<seg id="1024">Our politicians, the news industry and Hollywood continue to keep track of it.</seg>
<seg id="1025">I have been working in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how these powerful, flawed narratives dominate our news feeds.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This narrative overshadows the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries during the last three decades, while the US won't even choose her first female presidential candidate in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narrative discerns the fact that when French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings and forced Saudi Arabian, Muslim women to cover their entire body, these are both sides of the same coin.</seg>
<seg id="1028">"" "a powerful group exercises its" "" "control" "" "on the" "" "other" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1029">This strong narrative weakens Muslim women leading movements for change.</seg>
<seg id="1030">It is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Africans who had been brought here with slave ships.</seg>
<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer-Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative has so deep and flawed our collective imagination that often Sikh-men and children become the goal of anti-Muslim attacks and harassment.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them, Islamophobia is not just fear of Islam, religion, but it is fear of the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1034">Belonging to the 1.7 billion</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry we are doing more than telling stories based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or on alternative facts.</seg>
<seg id="1037">We also create narrations which help us to understand the world.</seg>
<seg id="1038">And my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1126">Right now, on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley, conversations in the framework of the 8th Annual Conference on Islamophobia take place.</seg>
<seg id="1127">More than a hundred academics talk about our problems with the "other," "structural racism" and "American militarism."</seg>

<seg id="1130">We all have to ask ourselves why?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Why am I referring to this here at TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where, however, Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars are waged and people are enthralled by creating the "other" in the public presentation, was even scientific Stanford four decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of this, consciously and unconsciously to solidify the "other"; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women's March because the occupation that we had no president, the chocolate cake, while he already bombed countries and "other made" people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling initiative (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">"" "" "" "global Voices" "" "reported recently about a different initiative by Steven Bird, the invaluable blog." ""</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain and appreciate the linguistic diversity of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already held events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the feasibility of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces in which inhabitants don't have to forget who they are to belong to it.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while listening to" "" "listening often to understanding" "" "these events instead" "" "listen to listening, to feel, to tie." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers prepare their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their dedication and representation make it possible for the audience to be informed.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions, as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassiduou Council takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical of her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the fables of the Rabbit and the Baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his fables, John Nyamara is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You've listened to it!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities and the organisers hope to extend this. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytellers.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls for reinstatement of public debt from the US</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of a new audit of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to $72 million, on 3 April 2017, various religious and bourgeois organizations took part in a mass demonstration; the March began with the Mexican capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la deuda" (civic front for the re-examination of debt) and the ecumenical Church meeting in Puerto Rico.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian pool developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and families continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is hosted in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director of Book Sprints, a publisher of books produced by so-called 'Book Sprints' within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and is available here license-free includes a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what are the real costs associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to liberate Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the directory of the Adra Prison where he was sitting on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that pushes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, and instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have started to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of intermittent extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown place from the Adra Prison, a non-military facility.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer, Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel, based on a command from the military court, had taken part in Adra as a" strictly secret "command."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by persons who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His place of residence and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that Bassel founded, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bastille's cultural prototypes was more foresighted than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of many civilizations and here the Greek-Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he started working, the IS would do anything to extinguish this architecture which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace it.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked. he has taught others to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He has also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a commission which she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available license-free.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Cover from Youssef Abdalki.</seg>
<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora titled "It Happens":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It takes place during each visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the mind in the moment we embrace,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That each of the hazards doesn't matter to me,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, shackles and guards</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the crowding of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I go into every detail of your voice and words</seg>
<seg id="1235">Whom I bear with passion,</seg>
<seg id="1236">When your eyes say goodbye</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I will leave another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I return quickly to my solitude,</seg>

<seg id="1248">According to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights), more than 65,000 people have disappeared since the beginning of the protests against Bashar al-Assad's regime in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">According to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17.723 Syrians have died in custody since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: Director after release of corruption again on previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique's anger reacted to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state machine after half of his sentence in which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">Diodino Cambaza, arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 together with four other defendants, was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, where Cambaza's advice was between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good management and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which took place on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General's Office of the Republic, which rejected the motion, there would be no reason for Cambaza to resume his old post since the company did not carry out disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not welcome the action.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution that advocates public transparency, condemned the company's decision to restore the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a regression with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that even the company should have instituted a disciplinary action against the offending one.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company, however, seemed to be silent and did not make appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambican social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "" "disgusting" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza is a competent person, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of it had been granted.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish up his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he agreed to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">To the contrary!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director does not possess any morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">"" "" "" "Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him. I can't believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that already insulted the state so massively." ""</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing morals and serving the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served itself on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as if it was an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself became tired of this man who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to Samora Machel's prisons not only for the first independent president but also as a sharp, single-edged and - by the way - prophetic speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was, as he vigorously confirmed that "an ambitious human being is capable of all, even the fatherland for his ambitions to sell his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious person changes, my experience shows that it is not like that. he changes the tactics but he does not turn aside from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"" "an ambitious human being is at the same time criminal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions were also negative:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he was sitting for 10 years and released.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today the company, at which he is making money, resets him under contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - яαJakub (@ azmal _ Rafik) 12 May 2017</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or (in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely degrading connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for its use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with different meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chairs in Burmese are also written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalaraar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The facebookier Aung Kaung Myat explains the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was erased today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way, if they knew how he could alleviate his back pain by making a play of words.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is convinced that she will reduce hate speech by radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook needs to be more analytic before deleting all posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook doesn't delete the word" "" "Kalar" "" "manually." ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What should be done instead is to analyze the post carefully and check it by checking the nearby words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"" "for example" "" "Kalar Htine" "" "(chair) and" "" "Kalar pae" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">"" "" "" "the good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson." ""</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have shown that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to extinguish his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive by Facebook, I made a post to tell my facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to watch, post and share content for 24 hours, because the post "did not meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>

<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">To censor such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>

<seg id="1327">"" "" "" "Facebook" "" "censorship has provided a lot of ridicule among users." ""</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now laugh at Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken off the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that didn't contain hate speech, but were removed:</seg>

<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally heat the violence in Myanmar's communities, especially in the Rakhine area, where Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his failure to take control of the hateful hate speech on his Burmese pages.</seg>

<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Statistical Office confirmed that in 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements, trying to abolish the laws of childbirth, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this outcome.</seg>

<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition was responsible for tensions in this actually uncomplicated case, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the draft law.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But in early 2017, the draft law against the child marriage was decided - despite 4 senators (among them a woman) of the opposition and an independent one who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>

<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for it and not a single one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Once it was decided in the Senate, the draft may now become a law.</seg>

<seg id="1377">While the Attorney-General Paris Al rawi, a proponent of the law, said it was quite lawfully if Maharaj wanted to go against the law, most social media users wished to approach the debate in a different way.</seg>

<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, instead of discussing the discussion so broadly, instead of talking about the problem that we are inviting the state to our bedroom, "simply purposefully say that the state, our daughters, protects that it may be abused by large, hard-boiled men who are in advantage to them," would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to court action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where child marriage is legal or still the norm in different levels, even though there are laws which they prohibit.</seg>

<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey has opened the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day, it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "" "" "both students and reporters and fans of TV series are resisting the ban." ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech savvy Internet users are used to using wrapping tools for blocked web pages (an up-to-date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third-largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia, as recently published in a report published by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to be locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer calculator connections), which does not rely on the domain name system and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">However, the content is available in spite of legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (about the blockage of Wikipedia) we did everything to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the contents in decentralized and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was performed independently of the Wikimedia-Foundation, and it was merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirrors page from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors, when in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonville reported subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member and staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "podcast:</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagone Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with poorly positioned motifs and washed-out colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described Facebook as his first-class location helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live on the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just stopped at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida lodge) called me. he had received a phone call from my father that would be a leopard on the banks of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other river side where the leopard was located and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he was to know it, for he had already faced tigers face to face,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger is not disturbed by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the buggy appeared. he sits down immediately, we look at us and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar placed the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for fostering Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and usually lived in a tent to shoot at Bardia National Park recordings of Ottern. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This paper was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been republished as part of a Content-Sharing convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women with the greatest care avoid the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead, they use a pronouns or say" "" "father of my child." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that because of the social pressure they respect the husband and the fear of the consequences, they should disregard the norm, preserve this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by the Indian state Odisha by a false tribunal and infringed by her family and village community after having addressed a married family with a name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition not to mention their wives by name is also common among men. however, they have far less fear to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village Wallet in Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health workers and housewives, joined a unique club and quickly became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community of Video Volunteers and advocates for the dismantling of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1479">For seven years, Rohini Paz has been working with the help of her video camera to detect practices such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and manages these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, which Rohini showed in her discussion, acted by women who do not call her husbands at their name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open a discussion about the patriarchy with a problem that women could easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">To pronounce the name of their husbands out loud is a custom that they have dutifully perpetuated and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is regarded as deceitful, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by her name so far, wanted to try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by his name from now on.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage Rohini started her first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion going.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked all," "" "If we cannot tell the names of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, that means they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," says Raini Paola from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a secular tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she only giggled to herself during the whole exercise; another decided to release all the accumulated frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the rush of adrenaline about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that at home they would actually try to name their husbands at their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the coming days, Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member chose to do it for dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law started to arrest her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in jeopardy.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the cinogenic dot on the forehead that shows the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "I said to my husband that I would carry the" "" "zinnoberred" "" "point if he did it too." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped bearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped completely, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make an excursion at every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their life; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so sincerely about some things, for example, as our identities are attached to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only borne Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, that's okay, but some wanted to wear a sage turta, a wide shirt over a pants; they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much controversy and discussion about the advantages of one's dress code, the morale associated with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggles up her own pair of Kurtas (Obershirts) into a discussion round so that women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since the beginning of the discussion, Rohini confirms that things are slowly rolling:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have done only small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped saying the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, still do it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the names of their husbands; only one or two women are wearing Zinnoberrot on their foreheads at all times.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the Discussion Club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like slipping around more freedom of movement or their own clothes - are at the end of a hard-to-navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini declares:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not just limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we're talking about and what we're doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers Community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and some of the organs were taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi have been used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is a local superstition that the head of a bald man can hold gold or bring wealth, "said the police officer of Zambézia of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the aim of assassinations for obscure purposes, is people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN implemented a mission in South Africa in 2016 in order to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, particularly in neighbouring Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Husky Algy Adamo, student and resident of the town of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police had already followed the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, for presumably superstitious rituals, has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans (PRM), which also indicates that a faith existed, according to which the sacrifices in the head might have power to generate wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men with hair loss problems have been killed in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">On Facebook, Angela Ferreira Samantha shared the chronicle of the Bloggers' poor Snaippa explaining that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MÖCHED ININ Mozambique, THAT I am ashamed of a country in which people would have shame to demand sex against good marks, and would even take their lives to earn their bread, a country where people wouldn't be hunted or even bald for superstitious purposes or "black magic."</seg>
<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some missed the opportunity for macabre humour.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably just recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published under a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been admitted to hospital because of liver cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009 Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (murder) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto demanding democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius as" "" "an internal affair," "" "and told a speaker that he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to release views from the international community, Nobel laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries criticized the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely turned out the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations, united nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to facilitate treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway - Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Minister of Foreign Affairs Børge Brenden have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was staggering after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume exports to China as exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill-headed, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was not able to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The EU's top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, also called for China to release Lius as she announced in an statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">"" "" "" "we also expect China to lift up all the restrictions of Mr Liu's wife and family members." ""</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>

<seg id="1652">"" "ambassador Terry Branstad told the Americans that" "" "they want him to have the possibility of treatment abroad, in so far as he can help him with his recovery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth-Polley, announced the news agency AFP on 27 June that the embassy calls on the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but to free his wife Liu Xia from their house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the U.S. Embassy's request drew a furious response from China, with the Foreign Ministry's statement that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and unanswerable remarks on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley announced that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">"" "" "" "protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice, which it claims according to Chinese constitution and judicial system and international obligations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz also adopted a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing to the Reuters news agency that China had large concerns as to whether the vortex around Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June Canadian Ambassador John McCallum asked China to provide adequate medical care to Liu and give him the opportunity to be cared for by his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer previously told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always supervised the room at the hospital and that it is not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to talk and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to allow for the exercise of these rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France, France</seg>
<seg id="1669">In a statement on 29 June, China issued the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All the necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where it is needed. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information that France will eventually receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan and Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of continental affairs in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Liu and show greater tolerance towards those who advocate peaceful means to promote political reform and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual lip to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, expressed his concern in an explanation on June 28 at Liu and admitted that many asked him to pray for Lius well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt very moved and encouraged personally when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or Country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid since Singapore is internationally recognised as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the International Branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore as a city to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody asked if New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the Cavalierio blog accuses the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices, to create this precious land, one hears that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very classy: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in the face of it, he inevitably appears undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally towns which are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core of the theme, the good old lyre pops up from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leave the twisted logic as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the responses given last week by Shanmugam were given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Correspondingly, he tarried rationally with non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, since she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to what country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point insofar as it was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out on the critics that one should start reading the whole text of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements made by Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Please read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was a" "" "city" "" "rather than a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections are so unimportant even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities were seeing a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore is" "" "no country" "", "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of a growing generation, who makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes that is really associated and aware of what he's defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the weak points of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Herr Shanmugam commit "good faith a mistake" or was it a Freudian advocate?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, in which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, but do they not defend their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay back our Prime Minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink personnel ID?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">According to the magazine Journey of a Decade, Singapore is and has always been a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I didn't say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear statements like" "" "the defence of the country especially" "", "etc., but that is not quite right." ""</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1741">The most recent part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>

<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in its interlocutor by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">My clarification follows usually the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice Hockey, Nature." many Canadians may cook internally against anger when they are held for Americans, but that doesn't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know himself, there is little that separates us Canadians from Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1771">To be harmless means to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far from the things that happen around you.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop-band, famous in Thailand, has released a music video that parodies the junta, which in 2014 seized power and, in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">"" "the new song" "" "Dictator Girl" "" "(Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about the precepts his girlfriend makes." ""</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days, the video uploaded to Facebook was divided 1,254 times and received 8,800 Likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">"" "last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video" "" "The Dictator" "" "was blocked in Thailand, after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video." ""</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, particularly as it relates to the situation of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these images of the video, which relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of girls" "" "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the preliminary constitution granting the commander-in-chief of the army absolute decision making on important national issues." ""</seg>

<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was established in the army that monitors online content and persons accused of having slandered the monarchy to have prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand establishes a strict law against "Lese Majeste" (Majestic offensive).</seg>
<seg id="1794">Martial law was proclaimed in Thailand on 20 May 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup in the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive U-boats, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax payers.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before placing them in an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are imprisoned because they allegedly caused "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should insult the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile the teaser of the song showed members of the band, who imitated the tribute of "The Hunger Games," which was already used by Putin's opponents during the 2014 protests.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and appears here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places for their hospitality are known.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is run by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink gold frame and golden earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 per night, guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and metal beds.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the vestibule there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells, people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call: "Mama Afrika!</seg>
<seg id="1909">"" "where are you Mama Africa?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1910">It is rather quiet at the moment, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them medication that they cannot afford, she massages them with a balm of the feet exhausted by the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychai Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was a proper nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move northwards.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that Haitians and Africans often travel along the route and that Africans are already talking to Whatsapp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his trip to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will contact Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "" "he answers smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">MS Ramírez tells her that her guests often send her text messages when they left to greet her or to report her about the course of her trip.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">MS Ramírez is perhaps very well-known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a cul de sac leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people can help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After living for three years, he was expelled after a raid on his workplace from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he has fled to Honduras with his wife and three children in front of people who wanted to exert money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single teacher, offered him their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next step is to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests again.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Passengers quietly consult their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">MS Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who went away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leaves her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair-fleets she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, while she briefly imagines her.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang people are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication equipment in Xinjang of twitter-users as well as progressively more</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan neighborhood of Urumqi received a cell phone notification in which it instructs the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Clearance").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the announcement, it is said that the app will prevent" "" "prevent access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities knew how to use the app for more than fighting terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because, shortly after installing the app, they had exchanged messages with a private chat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In informing the police, the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can, of course, be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While notifications of digital censorship in China mainly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those living in remote, repressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit disturbances and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based media outlet "Images from mainland China" (b), the censored news published in China, showed photos from a checkpoint where policemen were randomly checking out whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered at a checkpoint with a device without this software, you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">You have forced people to use devices intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the sequencing technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (b & b) also published a Jingwang product description which highlights that the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus obtain unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All governmental branches, authorities and institutions connected with the party, including universities and research institutes, are obliged to follow the instructions given by the Cybersecurity Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard disks, notebooks, and media memory cards" at the local police until August 1.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis's three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole series of other possible offences, including those referring to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I got used to it, not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I really can't say exactly when insults and hits after a friendly chat have become an ordinary means of communication for me.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how that happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished if I had done nothing to deserve this punishment.</seg>
<seg id="2064">On punishment in all its diversity.</seg>

<seg id="2070">My cry did not suffice him yet, which is why they exchanged the pipe through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">At my first arrest, I asked myself whether the investigator used to work as a garbage collector or whether it belonged to normal work equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had intertwined four cables together to show us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within a single hour three of them changed, while I was still at the turn.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I listened to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The executioner noticed the cooling and didn't enjoy it, which is why he was next to an electrically charged staff.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he binds to his screen, sometimes to his computer, back and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which had belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs's family to escape from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as feline (such as: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their old-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed music.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with themes such as orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all of these topics are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not constrained by borders in his mind, and he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the disastrous consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special aversion to American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib contemplates his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees of the second generation" - he calls himself even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think about my own circumstances," "" "says Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so because I am a man," "" "while he pours in water dissolved Nescafé into two cups. it's the holy month of Ramadan; at this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness in breaking old traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the lugs speak lukewarm coffee and the wavens of the Kent-cigarette in the nose mainly of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially if you take a look at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Hence, it is easy to do basic things - like drinking water in public during Ramadan - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the interior ministry Jordaniens has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual Frontskaners Hamed Sinners contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concession of the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former spokesmen of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert had been cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which injects the well-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to "opt for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement might not simply be plain rhetoric, but actually reflect an increasingly clear crystallized reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib returned traditional gender standards by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, the number of "honourable morals" has taken place in Jordan - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honour points reached its culmination in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support the women victims of attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a 1954 crime against crime, women who are exposed to the risk of intra-family violence can "be imprisoned at indefinite times in prison," and for their release, many years of bureaucratic expenditure and the family's guarantee are often necessary for the woman to do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from subjects that are long regarded as taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">But Hdaib denies that his work is political but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression, not from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I was fed politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib attacks the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb," the focus again focuses on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse frequently repeats itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which one, in his words, "get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on gender equality have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to find out later that his comments were torn out of context, distorted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, it was streamed but only a revised version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib openly advocates the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance to homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nui, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuevo, who was supposed to work later on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, has nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian realm, there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian intelligence service has taken several former members of the government and members of the teacher association, with the reason that they critically criticised social media commentaries about the problems related to corruption rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaib's concert is said to be only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that's how Hdaib - is made up of slow, thought-out and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he is not only dreaming of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to" "" "experience it" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be approached by music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and democratically-made democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore also resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belongs to as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that it is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the festive carriages, the drums and the dancing have been handed over for more than a thousand years, in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region to force emissuses to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# SommerFestival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18 metre high fortress was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Seldom appearances and personal care were as important as in this story, as they help keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairstyle.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima's capital - a region with a very high crime rate, where street robberies and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to more and more normal citizens in the hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has inspired even an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts face each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks from them, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions exist on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school of Augusto Salazar, Bondy, who are located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to get training instead of bad advice in the barber-arts that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of youngsters have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops prior to the school year beginning in March and reported some of their achievements:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district, which we are very proud of, because we have built this educational community out of love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the article" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "", "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to accommodate affection towards people who feel disbanded?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This was precisely the question of the young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga of the Bogotart Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation, and inspired them to the campaign of Carta por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Just recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to help their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government signed a peace agreement with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces of Colombia), which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that Columbian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Before the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who had lived in illegal camps for many years, had been exposed to war rhetoric and carried on their arms around the clock, must now reintegrate themselves into civilian lives.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which has grown accustomed to life in constant fear, and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take it into its ranks and support it in setting up a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would have to unite and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This stated that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people this year, who needed most urgent requests.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of war history a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now more than 2,000 letters have been collected within the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought anyone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on March 19.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from Bogotá, travelled to the camp to deliver the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC presented themselves as they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and all that lies in between," said the political student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a MGL-garnet, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said to him," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he said," "" "I am answering a letter that someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never before in my life someone wrote something so beautiful, that's why I answer it. "suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him and set me next to the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, was tired of being the faithful companion of this struggle for all the years, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. joining the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the Hungertod. "I would never have thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now that peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start, students and some of the FARC leaders came to a discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already there was war and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave an insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the State exerted itself on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the possibility to develop a political party, we can help shape society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who have never heard of hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I have often seen and hated as monsters have been very painful for me, even people with beautiful feelings that have been turned around by their circumstances and their environment.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">For example, Gustavo González, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the following letter to Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Colombians had been prophesied that there would be peace after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, healthcare and employment opportunities exist, there will always be people who are willing to resort to arms, rise and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC are now putting on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call on all defenders of peace - regardless of what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the foundation of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">For that I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for his disrespect.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya in order to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by running up without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear in Grozny on the official television and say that I hadn't changed my sex, that everything was only bad talk, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have particle size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people spoke to my mother on the street once.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "You have brought a monster to the world that has corrupted not only your family, but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she put a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later a car with darkened window panes and a license plate with a 95 on it stood under the window.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something rotten.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registration, without having to know anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment I wanted to call my mum via WhatsApp, I received a message: "you don't think you're safe, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are in. you even know your room number.</seg>

<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about gender balance, that's a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this mental barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with the camera, I really try to look like the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends doing, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who had sat in the gun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that everyone could hardly wait for the end of Ramadan, and he did not finish a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">That is what I mean, they probably charge the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">"" "" "" "OC Media: are gay men still held in these secret prisons?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there are not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then above all, those who have no rich relations or who have been dropped by their relatives to put themselves at the court of Kadyrows.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know they are being held there so that they can later be presented as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "Should they be killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people had not simply disappeared, but were deliberately immersed in order to be radicalised.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have gone missing in this prison after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new about them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person himself was when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think before 2003 I was already known all over Grozny when I was living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia applied, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia was originally intended to introduce us to the" "" "civilisation" "", "but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had coloured eyelashes, wore tubular jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Safety of Sharia has never just curbed me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theater in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Don't talk about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say it to children when they make fun of sick people.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just shut their eyes off you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never offended me, never chased and never struck.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long before Kadyrow stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us, but primarily about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had smiled and laughed before looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In that time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic deteriorated steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity are you going to pursue right now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teetreffs, gatherings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>

<seg id="2379">I have discovered these people myself when I picked up a type of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddeab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who want to make you white with foam in front of your mouth, that there are no bobbins among them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">"" "the demorcists have the ones who have Kabardiner, the Russians also have; on the whole planet there are - but" "" "not in Chechnya" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think with transition identity to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahraz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months there has been a strong increase of suicide.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahrazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahraz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he felt ashamed of his own helplessness, inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahraz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video on YouTube kept the moments when he lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred within the Arab region of Ahrazi in August, and activists on the ground warn that more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahrazi Centre for Human Rights reported that a few others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazarwi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have joined this month.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families and pursue a safe work because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab rulers suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, in which a large part of the Ahrazi River living in Iran is based, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Ahraz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi Monarchy took power and in 1925 undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahraz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran and some of the most productive and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy is still developing slowly, and the local population only gets little from that wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically denies Ahrazi-Arabs workplaces in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of dams, the water from the Arabic areas to the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused by drought, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawk youngsters rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for Cooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, 55% completed secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "a" "" "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahrazi Human Rights activist resident in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic minorities in Ahraz and anti-Arab anti-Arab anti-Arab anti-Arab anti-Arab populations.</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, local Arab rulers are deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their living outside their hometown of Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahrazi and so hired, since even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speak the Arabic language or wear Arab clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab rulers have to endure, human rights activists hitting alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is preventable.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify with feminism, nor with the intersectional"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. taken by: Pixabay. released under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came out.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women respond - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women nowadays still earn less money than men despite equal education.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and societal standards still make sure that women come across a glass ceiling in various areas of life, and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still moving across the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is well known and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to speak on skin color, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused under racial segregation and discrimination, many white feminists decide what kind of violence we have been abused physically, mentally and verbally.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and to sing" Kumbaya, my Lord "in order to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalized form of racist-motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin deserve less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background more often refer to school than white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all men, all men, and even all men of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustices in her mind, which relate to both sex and skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "Sojourner complained in her speech in 1851 saying," "" "Am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a detached and marginalized entity in a historical sense." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "I refuse to join forces who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation, in order to advance their egocentric programme." ""</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of the overlap of skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to teach them a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and isolate themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before, that we define black women according to our own ideas and place ourselves in the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, author of the book Africana Past: claims for Africa (about: Africa-Womanism: as we recapture ourselves) says that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also in this way create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, emotional, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my being as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can blossom in an environment where my life is neither bypassed nor ignored nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" by Structural. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# wislicheinefrubin), which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police inspector told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner who had become violent against her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">A little time has passed since the end of her relationship and the police said her statement would be put to the file, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena for maltreatment, Ada Báez's accountable ad did nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman returned her display.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In general, if women report a complaint at all, they generally do not receive any support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit being victims of violence must report to the law enforcement authorities.</seg>

<seg id="2490">It is hard to find out how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudio, a social science research institution in Paraguay. "there are different information and reports that, however, do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay" she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>

<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the courts of peace. here, too, 86% of women's ads came.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women said they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>

<seg id="2499">Since the murder of women in Paraguay is not an independent crime, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone, journalists count at least 12 cases of murder in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want to do that, but after that she had to repent.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she endured psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult identifiable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never have thought that I would be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happened to women who are too submissive because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote contributions on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos itself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had enjoyed it for so long and did not leave it earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complicity.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">A draft law was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament on 10 August 2016, which was announced under the hashtag # Porellas (# for you).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiunaMenos movement (# non-invasive) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law proposes to explain Femizid to an independent crime and to punish harsher as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the legislative text was changed in a number of ways in order to also win the deputies for the law, fearing that the way for decriminalisation of abortions is banned, which is currently banned in Paraguay and punishable by up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The initial draft plan had foreseen most of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that the victims of violence need to carry out at present themselves if they just want to report and receive a safe accommodation to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as a part of inter-human relations.</seg>
<seg id="2536">A rethinking must take place here, so that violence is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever is silent about these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the perpetrators of crime.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to report as long as mistreatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been altered, including a passage which the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions on the changes diverge.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The Reconciliation section was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The presentation of the words "gender," "political force" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law, however, is regarded as a great backlash.</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Brazilian authorities closed the independent Arab-language newspaper Azamn for their reporting on corruption in the sultan.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be in prison where he is serving a year-old prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and brought to trial, but later released.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said since 1970, who came to power after he dismissed his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, alongside his role as the only Sultan, he is the chief executive in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Finance Minister, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The rule of the Sultan is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces, in particular domestic secrecy, to restrict civil liberties, including freedom of the press, and to torture, intimidate and instigate human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens, including activists, to freely express their views on the country's public affairs, such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on Azamn, its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper in which since its founding in 2007 on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) it was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>

<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fines of 3,000 omania Rial (7800 US dollars). in addition, a one-year professional ban against the two journalists was imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year prison and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of making use of "an information network to distribute material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For al-Abri, a security deposit of 5,000 omania Rial (13,000 US dollars) was fixed and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the pronouncement of the sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016, but sentenced Al-Haj to six months in prison for a year and Al-Maamari.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 following the release of his six-month jail sentence from the central prison in Maskat. al-Haj remains in prison where he is serving his imprisonment sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Chamber also revoked the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the Azamn Newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the Court to recover Azamn, the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Brazilian government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closure of Azamn by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed a further order in which the closure of Azamn was prolonged for three additional months and with which the minister once again lodged an appeal against the decision of the Appeals Court to repress the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The continuing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the paper are not the only cases in which the press freedom has been violated in Oman in recent times.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Other violations include, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the country's first independent online newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the continuing closure of Azamn and the detention of journalist Al-Haj, the impression arises that the Japanese authorities are still not ready to end the extensive violation of press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) calls on the Afghan authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. release Yousef Al-Haj immediately and unconditionally;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a secure environment for the Azamn Newspaper so that their journalists can follow their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture taken with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious implications in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research on these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ) at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia.</seg>
<seg id="2593">In the 1990s he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic was the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus, before deciding to go back home to support the Serbian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstanding of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrior RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Serbian national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I am also starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always stay on the receiver instead of being a doer.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>

<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are promoted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because funding and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory equipment is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already an interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: what is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, space exploration, healthcare (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it's the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">"" "the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment (the so-called" "" "paywall" "" ") also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research." ""</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the US to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about possible solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding a salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outrageous, the first plant which has been grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Mortons's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many types of salads he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents used not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green ton or curled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereal or board types. due to these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton is still breeding a salad, but he needs longer since his work is more and more difficult due to ever increasing restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if a boulder in a river is lying around which I have to jump." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far on salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And when they stand before the court, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the features are already patented. "he goes on as well as possible and tries to breed the characteristics he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and endeavours to not use any material protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is becoming ever bigger in the United States and all over the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">"" "astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman salad of the sort Outrageous in the" "" "greenhouse" "" "of the station. there it is tested if plants can be grown in space." ""</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"" "the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" "" "Open Source" "" "seed) is inspired by the movement for free" "" "Open Source" "" "software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software." ""</seg>
<seg id="2645">It has been established to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are therefore permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can undertake to freely use the seed bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties, and not immediately cut them out - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Dark views on the horizon</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the Emeritus Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of seeds and the ability to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds play a role in greater cohesion such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would attempt to use the latter not or only little by bred seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg points out that the "open-source" movement is not dealing with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grains, genetically modified or not, from organic agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seeds," he says, and takes account of the increasingly common mergers in the global agricultural industry, whose recent examples are the mergers of ChemChina and Syngenta and Bayer, which, for example, are offered on farmers markets, should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to helping others to keep their seeds available free of charge, as opposed to patenting seeds and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk because the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore increasingly available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all carton characteristics are protected as intellectual property, making it usable for plant breeders either at all or just terribly usable.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, there are still no such estimates, but experts like Luby suggest that widely grown plants such as wheat are still more patented than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown so that they have targeted desirable characteristics - from those that enhance their taste or colour right up to those due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much less predictable by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and decisive for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradicts the opinion that intellectual property uses other breeders since "patents and protection of plant varieties encourage innovation." a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow once the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by providing more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this differently: wait 20 years until a patent expires, certainly sponsors no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to be able to breed plants adapted to the changing environmental conditions, you have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want farmers to facilitate their work." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us forward, and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "in all, Morton is interfering with the concept of patenting plant characteristics:" "" "we don't really create the characteristics themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form themselves and as breeders, we finally have no idea how plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who breeds a variety also breeds his own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation it is needed mass herbicides, breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is absolutely opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, they create the most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks as if I have been using my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties themselves in a few years, "he says." with a patent it is protected against competition for 20 years, which makes it very easy in my opinion. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in the "open source" breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (Centre for Sustainable Agriculture), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is a "open source" seed program. to preserve the seed of traditional plant varieties, the Centre is working with farmers and helps them breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>

<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for Open Source seed systems explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for "open source" seed systems for which the official starting signal is to be launched next year.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organization and blog are the latest censorship goals in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government locked up the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents violations of human rights in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "August published the Network an Opinion on Facebook in which it sharply criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue work and efforts on human rights in the region." ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains pale in spite of this attack and the derision of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are actually defending the law to uphold the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it has never been as important as now. ANHRI confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blockage and not surrender. we insist on fulfilling our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered to be the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organization of the wave of website locks to victims. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arab language https: / / t.co / NIZmopDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, there is no access to the blog posted by the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles that he writes for web pages and media inaccessible to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he set up to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, was even the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider that is also home to Zipp's blog, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video as the police practiced physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly around policy and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada said to the ban by the government and reflected what this meant for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">Blocking blogs is very old but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even though blocking the blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It was successful for them to give me the feeling of a siege; arrest, attempted murder, summons at the National Security Council, blocking blogs as well as any other web site I worked for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You proved that I did not write for nothing. in other words, my words have an influence on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">At first I used to post articles in order to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now that they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous go the way until the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests in networks of different Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and ETISALAT.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blockage of providers through the bypass of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offered began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that could have access to Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally worsened by the fact that the decision-making decisions are taken behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can precede judgment against these acts.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to censorship and who will it next attack?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants struggle.</seg>

<seg id="2752">Photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day after day, newspapers in the whole of Brazil reported murky headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the country's second-largest city and home to numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "Thieves rob Pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers to the army, navy and airwaves to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For detailed reporting on violence in Rio, the newspaper "Extra" on August 16 published the Editorial "This is not normal," in which she announced to set up a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sex crimes, etc. everything that happens by civilized standards and what only happens in Rio will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: it's not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper said that this decision was not a cause for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war rubric in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist writes that according to the Institute for Internal Security Studies in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 sites controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourses, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover the atrocities of the police who first shoot and then ask questions to cover up.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">"" "does the term" "" "war" "" "harm more than it benefits?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence is a "war." this is, in their opinion, a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult for the police to account for responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and self-pleasing neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">Describe Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil," according to Cecília: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north-east of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the murder rate per state, Rio will be in place 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">In addition, Globo, the largest media company in South America, is one of the biggest media companies in South America, which, like Cecília, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">The establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificaora), a police unit ordered by the federal state of Rio in 2003, was one of these security policy measures, with the aim of capturing a favela by using a massive police custody order and permanently stationed there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decline of violent deaths. however, after several years, the UPP has been increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities who were supposed to protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010, explaining why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention, for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio serves as war also serious consequences for the people after themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this requires the state to use resources and ways typical of war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of "collateral damage" and "lost balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War going or her, fact is that the inhabitants of the Favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week ago, the police cleared the mountain with the favela Jacarzinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident made headlines: a reseller died as a result of shots that the police had fired from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by Assad's regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently about one million Syrians in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Ost Ghouta region is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 required hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege, which led to the fact that the inhabitants are dependent on locally made or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockage, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics will teach the inhabitants of Eastern Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a "food-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food quality makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The direct of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because you can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2815">It is planned to provide 125 families with knowledge of the planting of mushrooms, so Dr. Leila becomes Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 €, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo until Monday, September 4th 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on October 21 in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires raging in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and around 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government's last week of solidarity with victims for 3 days.</seg>

<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire bursts spread in northern and central regions of the country, reaching about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite imagery, in 2017 alone, about 500,000 hectares of forest were burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been assassinated by the Taliban and many Hazara felt unfailingly suddenly.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came ever closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Ashark found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was hard and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran. once again, he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and towed sacks with mortars, heavier than himself, to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really tough," "" "Ashark recalled in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows, so that we did not freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Ashark left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited island of Greece.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Ashark returned to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Ashark was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid needy twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that due to relatively high twin quotas, Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers. it is also true that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes," "" "the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the large majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in more than 3000" "" "special recording centers" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially filed an application for asylum - which can go on for months after the asylum seeker has been registered.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who do not have money for accommodation can either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Ashark.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unrestrained liking helped Ashark to come out of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of working in the construction industry, Ashark put his whole savings into the creation of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while, he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Ashark Baratis success story is now the theme of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film won the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to the official estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years some Afghan-owned businesses, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the Peace & amp restaurant in Padua; Spice and also behind the Kabulogna Pizzeria in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Ashara's goals reach far beyond the Italian gastronomic trade and retail and go back to the country, which he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also opportunities," says Ashark with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily when I know my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan to plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces in the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Ashark also forfeits plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques." "" "they can sell their crop hits on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development to a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Ashark has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported on the clearance of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo that protested against the decomposition of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament checks a draft bill suggesting that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registering with a governmental authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users must register in order to be able to use social networks within six months following a successful legislative decision on the authority's website, stating their full name and identity number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months "imprisonment or a penalty of punishment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The Act, which has been applied by sixty members of parliament, is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May, another member of the Parliament filed a proposal to introduce tougher sanctions for the insult of the President or a senior official.</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law proposition, such a crime would, however, be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian policemen while demonstrating violence against demonstrators fighting against the military coup that led to the inauguration of the elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">As more than 700 protesters who had been arrested during the same incident, Shawkan waited four years in prison for a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison management, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the accused from prison into the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan faces the death penalty due to a number of human rights groups, including missile defense, illegal gathering, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza acquitted the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mossad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on the pro-Morsi seat blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the punishments of journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested during the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists listen to leaked documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours interrogating Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia has mainly been interrogated to a vigorous action plan. said plan comes from the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, endorses a controversial draft bill that would warrant to businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, provided they return all unlawfully received monies.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on the website of Nawaat on 21 April sheds light on how the presidential plans to support the bill of legislation look like.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejects the designation of its sources by stating Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which provides journalists with the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he was a witness in the District Court of Tunis on May 9th as a witness.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Will China force the users of social media to present their ID?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations of the Information Office of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need permission before writing or sharing messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">The regulations also indicate that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts expect that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks. it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these provisions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Then do we see ourselves in "WeChat?"</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat has failed to register as an" "" "organiser of the information distribution" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a law from 2014, thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organise the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing contents and to force them on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites are currently comprised of websites such as Vcontacts and Odnoplacniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, Mail.Ru e-mail service and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has Wikipedias blocking</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to clear two English-language articles, the information that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "the Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication addressed the site being blocked because it" "" "cooperates with groups" "" "to join a political diffusion campaign against Turkey." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time Turkey has completely blocked our website. it is, besides, among others, China, one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Britain can't stop sniffing around</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week of leaked documents, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers, which would force internet service providers to monitor communication in real time and install Backdoor programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and secret services regarding the proposal but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation will continue until May 19. reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be passed on to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
