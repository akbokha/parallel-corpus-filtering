this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him , because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA has illeg@@ ally listened to tel@@ eph@@ ones by Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally gave Iran designs for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years the government has fought against cracks and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of den@@ ounc@@ ing whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and to spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitution , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get that information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked on Ris@@ en , he did something that many bold repor@@ ters did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all of a sudden , although for years that it would be essential for their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped to crack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ters and sources can hide themselves less and less .
instead of failure and spl@@ itting to make statements , this could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent to secretly get his telephone calls home ,
just like his email data , financial and banking information , his credit , and even cache listings with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , and Ris@@ en &apos;s alleged source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of their work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower left to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional complaint , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all .
but just as government technology allows the government to b@@ ypass the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that didn &apos;t exist yet when Ris@@ en wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site like that of the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , just like with any regular contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer proc@@ ure information in secret , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
Secure@@ Drop is , however , only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments all over the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility of mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
who wants to report about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the care of soldiers and report to over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental officer who al@@ erts the alarm to the poll@@ uted water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a wall @-@ street in@@ sider that warns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes but to protect our constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that rich and powerful &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to make a statement . &#93; this week we were informed of news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ ul Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister has res@@ ig@@ ned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is claimed that a trail of $ 2 billion will lead Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin to a close friend of childhood days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next un@@ disclosed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should this be done to us ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this applies to all of us .
for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians , like secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , are used by a few to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function .
I always imagine it like a mat@@ ry@@ os@@ h@@ cap@@ u@@ ppe .
so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures .
it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters .
I think it &apos;s interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA .
presumably because there were so far no prominent Americans who occurred in these revelations , this sc@@ andal .
now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but due to the principle of these tax ha@@ v@@ ens , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , there is less information needed in some US states to provide less information in order to establish a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the USA allowed employees from school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a secret investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ators acted as African ministers who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the United States in order to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked him that all up to a lawyer made suggestions to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course nobody was given money to anyone . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our secret investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through which corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability are established .
and to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may sound very bo@@ ast@@ eful as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed , as if there will always be the rich and the powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I do know that some things have begun to change .
over the past few years we have seen violations of transparency regarding the owners of companies .
the subject took political attention from British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has caught up in central registers at the national level who really lies behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of both parties have tab@@ led a draft law in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us in Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false firms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and advoc@@ ate to end this type of transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency that now allows this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a res@@ ale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . then he would go to the cor@@ ps of peace .
I invited him to a beer . he excit@@ edly told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I became tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he got worse the whole thing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a place to sleep now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go for peace @-@ cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans this . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ da !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; See how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what inspired me there ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
a stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sne@@ aked at the toes at the door , and my bedroom door shut off .
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the artwork he bought from me today hangs in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a time jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my room@@ mate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear in having fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought how we could deserve something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and each morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created such &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ets ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we said good@@ bye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we could at the same time find new friends and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept .
thus we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited for the mis@@ sile to ign@@ ite .
but it is not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you concentrate on the things that you can do well . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design do something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of confidence we entr@@ ust .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left seated person .
this quiet touch of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they can see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they spend the night somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just so , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile ?
could you announce on Twitter that he is can@@ did@@ dic@@ ated for the president &apos;s office ?
you can return the cell phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I want to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor first presented himself with his name ; if he told him where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you had 150 assessments that everyone says : &quot; he really can hold very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to hand over your mobile phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system will strengthen trust decisi@@ vely .
at the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to surrender negative jud@@ gements .
ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest left their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how prob@@ able it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are about age and place of residence .
little surprisingly , we trust the people most , who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it becomes exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing will change .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation sticks out simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer sooner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you tell too much , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request will not be accepted .
so there is an optimal degree of openness , for example &quot; Great works of art in your home ! I make holidays with my family . &quot;
how do you manage to create this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on what topics to write .
our entire company is based on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards strangers .
what we did not expect was the huge amount of people who were more than willing to disman@@ tle these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
thir@@ dly , a need that hadn &apos;t been covered before .
for us the business is running very well .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or have devast@@ ated homes .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts already when I only think of it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million nights provided was a fraction of a problem .
for people trusted one another .
if trust works , wonderful things can arise .
one of our guests went to Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to seated activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels that save one &apos;s life even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they pass books .
they can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay does not exp@@ ire .
but these relations behind the mere money transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the Share economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the thought of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is about economic trade here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to call it simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not just the case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people open a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , it is easy to compare with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place that you visited , a group of residents would wait to fill a thoroughly and show you a pub craw@@ l neighborhood of which you have never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would create apartments from the ground up for sharing ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would assume the idea of sharing a shared part ?
I imagine cities that enable society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking places that belonged to the government ,
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were im@@ par@@ ted to people whose children were moved out .
in order to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a stranger or even a host .
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was a great hospitality before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why exactly did it work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that with the components of trust you can find the right design .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find this amazing ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
we know , of course , that design can &apos;t solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this big impact , I wonder what we can use for design soon .
thank you .
what do you think , if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay at the airport security check .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their bom@@ bers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a w@@ ann@@ abe @-@ fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslims .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born that way .
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old , I decided to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : back then it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence for me , and compared to the pressure I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , I was able to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted passive belief in my parents .
I have strug@@ gled with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thinking , questioned , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and yet loves you somehow ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I got married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people rus@@ hed out of the buildings .
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock quickly turned into indignation .
why should we do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
it is not only my country who has been attacked , but in N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a suspect .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the United States in order to move into a new city and start studying post@@ graduate studies .
I remember , as I drove -- when we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims .
we went to our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Rem@@ ain in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be afraid . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday that week -- the day Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings ran : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people who were considered Muslim , sm@@ ashed and beating them .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked this land attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have swe@@ pt the anger of the people to the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to have to explain ourselves continually .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it &apos;s the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today we can actually say people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the US body .
it only raises the question : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less , because the question is false .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the US body , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first @-@ aid and Olympic athletes .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there may be some parking spaces un@@ locked , but not stopping terror .
regular visits to a mos@@ que leads to a more toler@@ ant approach to people of other fai@@ ths and to show greater ci@@ vic participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , D.@@ C. recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
in the process of radic@@ alisation it has been established that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even by their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and ideology is a tra@@ itor or dis@@ cour@@ aged by faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we have to stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would fit into their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , as the K@@ u Klu@@ x cl@@ one with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you take a look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every spiritual man with whom she spoke , sil@@ enced her and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring it into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense to her anger , she was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution .
this Ima@@ m restored the connection to God and their church .
instead of acc@@ using them of their rage , he showed their constructive aven@@ ues for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia concerns me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , to our freedom of thinking ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , conformity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a study shows that when people submit news about Muslims in which negative about Muslims have been reported , they prefer military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look at when the mood sw@@ ells up against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public in order to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well @-@ informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of anxiety har@@ ms us all .
when as@@ signing collective guilt it is not only about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ an was a sports@@ man .
he was at the dental faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was ba@@ ff@@ led and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when has such a young man come out of my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , just as he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he fired at De@@ an eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or stayed at home safely ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one thing that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat we drove silent , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , put off my shoes , and went into the hall of prayer , and what I saw allowed me to stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled people were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to help us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had preferred the courage and compassion of panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you sure to be safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who perhaps claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker , working in a noble mind@@ set , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say you &apos;re not fo@@ ol@@ ed . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
looking at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so in no way I am an exception .
when humans appear as an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billion @-@ dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air @-@ par@@ ting penet@@ rated our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre high tower of 1,@@ 500 tiles live in front of the public . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting together , flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of spaces .
they can also build up @-@ to @-@ themselves tensile structures .
they have learned to bear burdens , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to transc@@ end the limits of the possibility in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know coll@@ ectively where the mobile objects are in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in space , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
an aircraft that tries to hit two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can fluctu@@ ate and has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a restriction of rear star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the air device doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter .
one such question would be : what is the minimum number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that join to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft , which only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently discovered that flying with only one works . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanically simple remote controlled flight unit . it was invented recently .
it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no more actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanically simple , so much happens inside the inner life so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in space .
nevertheless it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern star@@ ters . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it right .
the odds of throwing it right when everyone watch me is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the Omni@@ icop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only balanced .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its orientation .
as a result he ob@@ tains the extraordinary ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter in which direction it is turned or even rot@@ ated .
of course it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some things can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at it .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they need to be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate double @-@ prop@@ ellers .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you assemble them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly , if restricted .
we will now demonstrate this by making one half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration will investigate synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units offers a wide range of aesthetic expression .
we took standard Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ters -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technologies and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ governed . that is why there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine , on Broadway , would like to be a flying shade par@@ ach@@ ute on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
for types like us wages are in development and the act of creation .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed around each other in a very far away gal@@ axy , transforming the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
this short moment they sh@@ one bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
we speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into the space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange events at first .
just 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ part life had just emerged on Earth .
since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is standing us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of especially courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravit@@ ational @-@ waves that arise approximately by colli@@ ding black holes .
most people thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognised them as crazy geni@@ uses , so the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser inter@@ fer@@ ometer @-@ gravit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gravit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes co@@ ined through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the f@@ arewell from my sick father .
in essence , these were the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gravit@@ ational waves of black holes for 23 years and their through observ@@ atories like lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gravit@@ ational waves ?
a wave of gravit@@ ation is a ri@@ pp@@ le in the structure of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and pushed into the other .
for illustration , lec@@ turers in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity often lead to a really al@@ ber@@ y dance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem is that gravit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous , are .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and stu@@ ffed at the arrival of the waves . the stretching of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is to say , 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by 1 . therefore , the Lig@@ o staff declared crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gravit@@ ation
Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves in the following way : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more one ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite practical , because you can create a picture or a map of things by observing the light coming from several points around you .
in the case of sounds , this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean a lot to you :
the face of your child for example .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Alice &apos;s talking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob is breaking them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; du@@ ck Bob . &quot;
the same applies for gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot use them to create simple pictures of objects in space .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o , the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we transform wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
to listen to the gravity , can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been working very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , chir@@ ping simple : w@@ up@@ p !
if the two bodies turn very fast , one hears the same chir@@ p with an additional key change . that sounds like this : wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of motion @-@ wor@@ d@@ guard , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des Sound &#93; Som@@ ebody knows what to listen to , this recognizes as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let us think briefly what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , circul@@ ate one hundred times a second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we &apos;ve heard it .
therein lies the abi@@ ding meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o opens a completely new way of exploring the universe , as it has never been possible before .
on this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
we cannot see much in space -- practically or basically -- .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ tive stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
the exciting physical processes , however , happen at the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through since these are op@@ a@@ que .
gravit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own after@@ glow .
using gravit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back until the beginning .
and the most important thing : I &apos;m optim@@ istic that all things exist that we have never seen before , which we will never see and of which we have no idea at all . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , in the first attempt , Lig@@ o found things we had not expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the League project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , such as Lig@@ o watches , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of pre@@ historic times . the black holes are , so to speak , the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a totally different view of the events happening in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us ?
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of was removing my fear .
my fear of keeping speeches , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a certain yes that changed my life to an unexpected way . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest one , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my bill of be@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked me once if I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the Beg@@ inning
from then on , I s@@ wore to always play with them as soon as you ask me to do so . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am the author . I think things out , stir you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I created television . I produce television .
I make television , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for bringing about 70 hours of program to the world .
four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each stream offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode all nine days times four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollar television , four television programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes simultaneously : 24 episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run consec@@ u@@ tively on Thursday evening .
my series runs in 256 regions around the world in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are programs that I have created myself , and not only produced , so on top of that . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who does it ?
no one , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you , that all of you , who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously when I speak of work so that you understand that I am not just lying around on the computer and fan@@ ciful , and it is true when I say : I understand that in a dream job it &apos;s not about dre@@ aming .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , everything per@@ spir@@ ation -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops when I painted on a canvas .
as a result , one could achieve a high tone , deliver a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love working .
she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is the sum .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a bu@@ zz is beginning in my head , and it grows and grows , and the tot@@ em sounds like a busy road , I could always drive on it .
many people assume that when I explain to them the sums , that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does it .
but the sum -- when I began to work and work and work , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . sum@@ ming !
the sum is more than writing .
the tot@@ em is action and activity . the sum is a drug .
the tot@@ um is music . the sum is light and air .
the sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a h@@ um , you cannot strive for size .
the feeling of not being able to be different than striving for size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I &apos;m not done for failure , and I just know that I love the sums .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one thing clear : the more broad@@ casts I will be , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more my expectations are .
the more I work to succeed , the more I must work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I like this sum . I love sum@@ ming .
I need the sum . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I only this bu@@ zz ?
and then the tot@@ als stopped .
revised , over@@ stressed , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the tot@@ um stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single working title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my M@@ um won &apos;t be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sums were stopped .
the bu@@ zz of the engine spe@@ eded up .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was out of stock .
the sum did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a Titan does not sleep , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show@@ piece titanium ,
everything was grey , I just couldn &apos;t have fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the sum I was .
so what do you do if what you do is suddenly f@@ ading the work you love ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ail yourself , stupid author titanium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do it , you work , you love what you are doing , being a teacher , being a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , one simply loves another one and that gives one the bu@@ zz when you know the tot@@ um when the bu@@ zz is stopped , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no when two things become aware of me :
first , I have to say Yes to all and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t call anyone more &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when did this happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my bu@@ zz craw@@ ls away , and everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of sum@@ ming , I can &apos;t do anything except watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl wants to release into &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so tight that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is slowly coming back .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel like I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with you .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the titanium dioxide , this is just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself using programmes and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the sum is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum depends on the love .
the sum is the current that comes from the lust of life .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real h@@ um ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it &apos;s just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so I can free myself from any fault as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the hum@@ ming again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not just about how to work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working at the workplace than at home .
this admission is painful , because what a person pre@@ fers to be rather than home ?
well , yes , I .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I must have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed is not one of them .
we fly around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused .
I always take my mobile phone .
but it is OK .
my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also do it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you consider me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or cookie replaces me .
and when my teen@@ age daughter talks to me for 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year .
it &apos;s just 15 minutes , more does not need it .
everyone can spend 15 minutes on a piece , even on a bad day !
15 minutes a day !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the kids ready to pray .
but 15 minutes are possible !
my children are my fe@@ el@@ iness , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you &apos;re doing well .
find out and preserve it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I will fail and win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a little , why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum came back in my spare time . the sum seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown tune , it fills me and my soul .
I like the sum , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the sum is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum@@ ming now .
the tot@@ als of life .
the tot@@ um of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just one part . I am so thank@@ ful for that .
it &apos;s sn@@ u@@ ff@@ ing that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan playing journey to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum . the land I create , the marathon which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ asses , the high clay , the sums , the sums , the other , the right sum , the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , consistent , naked and new feeling of life spreads in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am .
I am the author . I think things out , I resur@@ rec@@ t you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans don &apos;t have a chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capacity for self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures .
they certainly have heard of one of the most well known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; an electrode is im@@ planted deep in the brain to influence the neur@@ ons circuits in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function improves .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease that suffered from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often provided patients with trau@@ matic brain trauma .
they have to imagine that the brain sw@@ ells the brain with skull @-@ brain trauma and the skull pressure increases .
to save life , it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull .
for this you sometimes have to remove part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François succeeded .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly as a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface fabric of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they stem from these cells .
these blue and red cells called dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us , they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay for us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain because we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries .
but this is not so sure .
one thing , however , is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François .
and then mark them in colour in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we reim@@ pl@@ enn@@ ed them at the removal point of the same individual .
we call aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we reim@@ plant@@ ate these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we reim@@ plant@@ ate the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we reim@@ pl@@ enn@@ ed the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared as if they had been removed again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury to and reim@@ plant@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been reim@@ plant@@ ated .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we dy@@ e in vitro , in the culture .
of course we couldn &apos;t stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained apes with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
you had to take food pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
as they reached a stable level of skill we injured the motor skills range in the motor cor@@ tex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand any more .
just as it would happen in humans , they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate to a certain degree , just as in the apes .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left you see the monkey , who spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now , when we reim@@ plant@@ ated the cells , see the same monkey , two months after the rice plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that were very exciting results for us as well .
since that time we have discovered a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant it in humans .
I really hope to show you how the human brain gives the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giuss@@ ani : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can need that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and have tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then it is necessary to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to perform the treatments and evaluate if it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multic@@ enter study .
first you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and telling us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it really is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable entities .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew of Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , democracy is f@@ ading in us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country could not influence the austerity programs that were realized in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if anything would change .
at this point I would like to present to you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe once more that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save us democracy , but that we need a genuine and def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess democracy .
for without democracy our societies are bl@@ amed , our future is das@@ hed and our great new technologies are wa@@ sted .
I would like to point out an interesting contradiction to the topic of waste which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin peaks Par@@ ad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt , which casts his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
yet few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , belonging to the wealthy depos@@ itors and corporations , who are too afraid to invest where it would be productive and who could produce income that urgently needs humanity , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , a total of 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars have been invested in the US , England and the euro area , in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until it compar@@ es with the 5.1 billion US dollars , which at the same time circul@@ ate in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate except the stock exchanges and raise real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not offset by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the United States , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low aggregate demand , fear@@ ing the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , in which they do not invest . just like O@@ di@@ pus father who is fear@@ ful of the prophecy of O@@ rak@@ els could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up ,
invol@@ un@@ tarily involves the circumstances leading to killing O@@ edi@@ pus .
this is my hair with capitalism --
its very wast@@ eful nature . all un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; but before we continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do we mean by democracy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of ath@@ en@@ ian democracy based on these exclu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive thing about the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more importantly and decisi@@ vely , that they had the right to political participation with the same wei@@ ghting in questions of the state of affairs .
ath@@ en@@ ic democracy hasn &apos;t lasted long --
like a candle that shines brigh@@ tly , it is burned out quickly .
however , today &apos;s liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies don &apos;t have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which in the end was a statute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of the corporations -- became a democracy @-@ free zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies there has been a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , by gradually under@@ mining politics and deprived them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not a degeneration of its DNA .
it is due to the fact that nowadays you can be in the government and still not in power , because the power is mig@@ rated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my stri@@ fe with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that sustain@@ s so sustain@@ ably the animals from which they feed themselves , decim@@ ated that they are star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has so far can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ised politics that it har@@ ms itself through the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations grows , political goods are depreci@@ ated , the ine@@ quality falls , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the managers of the corporations are frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their businesses .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind .
if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and the economy back together , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keep control , just like in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor should only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is one solution : to aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
the problem with this is as long economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks greater , the waste of subli@@ me , and social conflicts go deeper , just as I think -- in countries like China .
so we have to re@@ arrange the economy and re@@ unite the fields of economy and politics , and make sure we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ united realm , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy that lets the film &quot; matrix &quot; appear like a documentary .
the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ie similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines are serving people , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life .
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in a nut@@ shell .
in the field of companies : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one work@@ station to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is property of those currently working in the company .
then all revenues come from capital and from revenue and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those that belong to the company , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there that the company does not belong to . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no to@@ wering twin peaks .
in the area of global political economy : please imagine that our national currencies would have a freely vac@@ ill@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest developing countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity .
keep in mind that all world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not necessary to implement the technical means .
today we have it , especially against the background of a re @-@ unified policy and economy .
the world I describe to you is also the most liberal in which it pre@@ fers privileged people , and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ nesi@@ an , global Key@@ nesi@@ an .
but above all else , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
interview with Bruno Luigi Giuss@@ ani ...
you describe yourself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything that I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and the economy is ... if we do not do this , technological development will produce such a massive drop in aggregate demand which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers den@@ otes as &quot; long term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we are experiencing it , it will not only destabili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I &apos;m completely confused .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not spinning , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your presentation , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have clearly stated what you think of the West &apos;s view of China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a huge amount of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of a democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays out -- is the sector of the economy -- a completely democratic sector . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in some ways , if I can say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to England of the 19th century .
for -- do you remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical regarding democratic development .
what one can observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
to blame China now , to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells immense in hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Greek finance ministers at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew that was coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say good @-@ bye to us , and the continuing den@@ ial that a massive fault line passed through the euro@@ zone and continues to mas@@ sively threat@@ ens the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have still chosen the den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable to keep alive through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it may be delayed for a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead of ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future unless we change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everybody who looks back -- seri@@ ousness ...
if there is a minister of finance or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he says he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
they merely wanted to overthrow our government , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions running through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they had been conducting a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for the last 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika who imposed on this policy was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be still pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if they do not survive , the exposed centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we allow ourselves to strike the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what it seems to me , it will also be det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope you will be wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
most people have never heard of Roy Price , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the tv production company of Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ geho@@ g @-@ hair@@ style and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movies , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for finding the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are located to the right of this curve .
this curve is the valuation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the website IM@@ DB . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows receive this review .
if your show is valued at nine and above , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of Show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need some special intelligence to forbi@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the average ou@@ ulation , the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire them .
so he has to make sure that he &apos;s really on the right side .
the pressure is available , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon makes such a thing , so Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and el@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where everyone can watch for free .
and if Amazon has nothing to do with it , you reach it , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
but they don &apos;t know they are watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you can record when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you jump over or look again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process it , and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon is supposed to make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked out .
approximately at the same time with another company , another manager placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always on the look@@ out to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different .
instead of organizing a competition , he and his team have watched the available data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , i.e. the reviews they give the shows , the course of which shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers what actors .
when they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data sealed companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this about ?
because logic says somehow that it should work in everything .
when you collect millions of data for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it optimi@@ zes it by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work in such a way , this is a little frigh@@ tening because we live in a time when we take more and more to statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here in the U.S. and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ miss@@ al occurs or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad , it &apos;s decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are produced . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies is wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that data analysis can predict qu@@ arri@@ es of flu , the worst kind , by data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year by year , until it suddenly ceased to work ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data flows visi@@ bly into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very smart people use many data in@@ concei@@ v@@ ably to make serious choices , such as the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be distributed .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , put this problem into its components so you can analyse the items ; as a second , put the items back together to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and intelligence , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been unable to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; which was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they comp@@ eted for TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and in order to not forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a j@@ a- or no @-@ question , you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will show it later with a technique demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , where I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with a little much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball becomes smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data still paying off , making decisions , being an expert in what you are doing and taking risks .
because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
