Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Irish institution , where young people are supposed to meet today .
a p@@ its chapel , where it is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
farmers cultivate the former ground of farmers .
the oldest official card in Munich supports exciting stories about days .
it is annoying when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this , which had to be exciting because the Nav@@ i Nav@@ i instead of a b@@ ypass road showed a green meadow .
the historical maps of the Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but very informative .
especially when comparing them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ ich , which one recognizes as such not immediately .
in the large picture postcard , more detailed maps were used for cities and municipalities , so @-@ called arch@@ ers .
these were written according to the Bavarian Meas@@ u@@ rement Department between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops departed with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , there were today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map .
Elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph further@@ ed the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian Meas@@ u@@ rement Department .
the submission form for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is to be found like any other on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of Early / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was conven@@ ed 21 years after the map was created , i.e. in 18@@ 77 , as a district of Munich .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling lies in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today &apos;s West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller @-@ part card appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; pri@@ me@@ val &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
small plots of land do not occupy more farmers there today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the scene of the Oktober@@ fest , was in fact still a meadow - and not a concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of the current district au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street names &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the height &quot; Auf der Venti@@ lation &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one once locked up people with ins@@ anity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich district Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended up ending the bet@@ ting of so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also prohibited the personnel from using violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , director of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients there was first place , later it was expanded to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ s@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar in 1905 .
since 2006 , Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um München @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts .
young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um meet at the site of the former Au@@ er institution .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with training facilities .
to the west lies the football field of the TS@@ V Munich east , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built - in architectural resem@@ b@@ lance to the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 ; the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lied bombs sh@@ elled many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a large remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn circle is carried out .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
citizens rights group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ thers has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to come into force until 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to bring special attention while travelling through the state and to be cau@@ tious as a number of question@@ able ra@@ cial @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in the statement of the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it difficult for people to gain discrimination , as well as the state law enforcement agencies which dispro@@ portion@@ ately target minorities , prompted the group to issue the warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in du@@ bi@@ ous circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more gasoline during the trip and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police , without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General , which shows that black mot@@ ori@@ sts in the state are hal@@ ted 75 percent more often than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring a deposit money or let relatives know they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FB@@ I report of hate crime that classi@@ fy the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company due to housing or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , following the adoption of immigration laws that will obli@@ ge local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for mig@@ rating violations , which will contribute to further ra@@ cial profil@@ ing in view of the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but l@@ ately interest groups have implemented the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
electric fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher crossover project is a successful project and will be continued next year .
the CD@@ U members Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have provided an image on @-@ site .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U stand together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties met at the court yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially provided insights into his operation , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many k@@ itt@@ ens supplies and houses in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing way for the milk of his cows , such as Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Regi@@ on@@ ales come to the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is the president of the fisher@@ man &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ L@@ H@@ V &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he described the electric fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot generate profitable growth on such steep areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the green area provides a lot of work and a lot of work needs to be handled with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental farm and cultivated it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ ser , even if it does not lead bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the municipality has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers should be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare .
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the areas could be taken out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how to continue their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers often stand in criticism because of their funding
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants .
the area of conservation is therefore 40 hectares , which cannot be aff@@ or@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half was promoted via leader , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometres of wil@@ lows .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and women &apos;s women it &apos;s not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter Weiß asser@@ ted that &quot; best food is produced here . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Stra@@ i@@ ght Line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg permits state fo@@ stering of fen@@ c@@ ers .
the objective is to open the Black Forest .
the requirement is the presence of a flow backdrop marked by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the fen@@ cing area must not be tow@@ ed ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation .
at the moment the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway for the Fisch@@ bacher crossover project 2018 .
the open @-@ air area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump holds the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans estimate this as well as any other - hence the most carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the president &apos;s proposals to dras@@ tically limit legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not attack the statue .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty @-@ im@@ it@@ ators would have ly@@ n@@ ched him if he had done it .
but it touched its meaning , and in particular the meaning attributed to it , as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go down to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tually correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about contemporary resonance to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ eds , your poor , and your oppressed masses who desire to breathe freely , and the el@@ em@@ ental rub@@ b@@ ish of your rich shores . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; mis@@ erable waste &quot; on our screens was better to see .
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict about the significance of America .
Lazarus and her friends , who used to place their words after their death at the base , knew very well that they executed a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republi@@ can@@ ism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical representation .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ants .
the connection between poem and image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue , people wanted to change it from the right wing for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anybody , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , bringing the American flame to the re@@ united world : &quot; Lady Liberty moves forward .
it is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not light the way into the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here on something .
the importance of the statue is entirely a question of the standpoint of perception .
the big imagin@@ ative deed of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted , mis@@ erable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horrible cru@@ ises on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue refers to them the words of hope and the welcome that they must hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to recognize .
their torch should not illumin@@ ate the path , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle rec@@ alls a time when only two Scot@@ s@@ men belonged to the UK team
the performance director of the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which ki@@ cks off on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special is developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics have to learn from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m stretch , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team to captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or exercise , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought together were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world championships in the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Scot@@ s@@ men are in the British squ@@ ad .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads on this road and last year has set up five British and two European records .
it will take part in 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs for 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man , which you should watch after a great season , which included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle rec@@ alls her first World Championships when the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was .
the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases they will also be involved in med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; to be so special about team captain , is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ers voted for me and chose me , it makes it really special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots belonging to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums .
as for my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think it went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block critics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers hit him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he kno@@ cked at the critic , for sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b , we are led like sheep to battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gans staff have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is why the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union su@@ ed him at the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dis@@ missed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type as Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his State and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary tool to connect with his voters and to de@@ file his hair @-@ loose head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , blocking of persons coming to the governor &apos;s side - which is a public forum that is designated as official and paid by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ ul@@ filled people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post talked to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans &apos;s Catholic faith .
attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; I said pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crime and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject , then some people are rather dis@@ regarded as a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the governor &apos;s employees called as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical cor@@ tical articles and to arrest and silence the demonstr@@ ators .
but this is exactly what happens digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ ump is acc@@ using Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County viol@@ ated the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous ep@@ ach@@ ograph@@ s critici@@ zed his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions that critic@@ ised the treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , over@@ came his ministry , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he has not sil@@ enced her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
former European No 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an organizes the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led alongside Arch@@ er@@ field Links to En@@ dr@@ unde , before losing up against Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry made a great job when he set up this place .
he is an avi@@ d advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his achievement here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career both at the European Tour and at the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that really feels very special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t be able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was taken out of the programme in the year after I won them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this event will be the first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a little more when you play home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer through passive smoking
in the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
researchers from the Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf University Hospital ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lob@@ es of lung cancer are due to passive smoking each year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this topic from 1994 .
back then there have been 400 cancer deaths per year due to passive smoking in Germany .
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
house connections prove to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are located half@@ way in time , &quot; says Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than supposed , as there is a lot of se@@ amounts in the underground , which is not noted in the plans .
traffic , which im@@ pe@@ des the construction work again and again , represents a major problem for the construction company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ ori@@ sts from red lights and shut @-@ off grids is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is locked and only the scheduled buses are eligible to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were already quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but fortunately we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent in the un@@ settled Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually den@@ otes a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour , the char@@ red tu@@ ber is extracted and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the floor - she does not have furniture - where she also performs her daily work , for example to wash clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless place serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is usual here .
of course , working late can be dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote by a public lift in front of the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement , which led to independence from the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal representatives from it .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , while the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea contained the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as seclu@@ ded as it is o@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rental car .
there is no public transport .
the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from corrugated iron roofs that were transformed by rust into various yel@@ low@@ ish @-@ brown tones .
very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we weren &apos;t used to wearing those clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her light skirt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we only had sheets on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable Gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ land , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port was min@@ ed in gold and copper worth 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Pap@@ ua dispos@@ es of wood resources worth $ 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preserves a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
a 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 15@@ 0,000 in a single officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ ua claims for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal country in the 1970 &quot; s became a genocide in accordance with the Asian Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Wer@@ den Every@@ thing Ver@@ ne &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is stated in a report by the arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports of atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as irregular exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric sho@@ cks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as incidents happen every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the bolts have strengthened , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources present an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the densely populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people are fighting to keep up here .
&quot; migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native , who moved to work in the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has ta@@ sted the native papers - the mo@@ m Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during his election campaign in 2014 , Indonesian President J@@ oko Vi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of legal rights in Pap@@ ua .
the former carp@@ enter captured 27 of the 29 bor@@ ou@@ ghs of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua little changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that it will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered from a low point in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers offen@@ ded their tone and later returned with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their gun @-@ bombs , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ enz@@ o , was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby Government Commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and carried the Wa@@ ita dance - continuously and im@@ it@@ ating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started hur@@ ting stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; states it in an official TI@@ ME document that has not been released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
no one was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly got shot in my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , the witness of the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in a glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , told repor@@ ters that his officers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings came to Jak@@ arta on the following day .
three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate discourse in Jay@@ ap@@ ura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2016 , Minister of Security , Wi@@ ran@@ to , said he has set out an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the sett@@ ling of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to with@@ drew when he spoke to TI@@ ME on June 5 in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , charged by the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; demanding more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence , said 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such alleg@@ ations with gri@@ m dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in panic have fear to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; he says .
the shooting did not stop .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a building company that refused to bring a consciousness @-@ free man to hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s sit@@ ing office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing the warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started shooting and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , so TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have hidden myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon the officers involved to take account of the police and withdraw the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a ho@@ op@@ ing to the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the Free Pap@@ ua Movement ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by spur@@ ring spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ den Ko@@ go@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people in the past few years have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of range .
people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep the bulk of the crop for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten not@@ a pieces cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the local Pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the Nab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs there are in the region usually go to the better educated and more prosper@@ ous migrants .
Pap@@ ua are rarely invested in capital or necessary skills to make their own enterprises competitive .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Go@@ bai , Chairman of the Tribal Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although their rare permission was given to them for filming .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaign to highlight the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ rest east@@ ern@@ most provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ paper@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ ua . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March six Pacific States - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so that it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited her silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the session but wants to remain anonymous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua claims they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai kis@@ sing , &quot; says Go@@ bai , the chairman of the tribal council .
he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ bai is saying that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice to Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ S@@ hot@@ s made a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of an victim was buried in an area exactly opposite the police station and the military station .
they know they may never come to justice , but at least they don &apos;t let those responsible forget their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday at one of the highest residen@@ ces in the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of residents to escape from the 3@@ 37 @-@ metre high , 79 @-@ story building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in only two years , which is to be called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a resident told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units destroyed the fire at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and cooled the building .
the government said that she was working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can resur@@ rec@@ t questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from cl@@ adding , outer fair@@ ing for decoration or insulation , came .
in Britain the police said they believed that the system of panels for insulation and cl@@ adding in the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : more best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) , with his large Davis Cup cou@@ ps , was held at the General Meeting of Shar@@ eholders .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup single only on two wins was not supported by the necessary two @-@ thirds majority .
the five @-@ set classics , which are often very long , but also therefore very much appreciated , are thus preserved to the traditional competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of member countries voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore just scar@@ c@@ ely missed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to ensure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work to improve the job .
even before the vote , after many in@@ consist@@ encies , the proposal had already come to the finale at a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : in future , the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right next year in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements regarding training positions etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to perform less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 U.S. Travel@@ ers bring forbidden items to the aircraft , find out a survey
a survey among passengers resulted in more than 20 percent conscious or un@@ consciously forbidden items past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 per cent who entered the aircraft while they accidentally carried out forbidden knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 per cent claimed they had discovered bel@@ at@@ edly that they had gone mad with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion , or explo@@ sives .
the survey carried out by more than 1,000 people , carried out by a jet Char@@ ter@@ service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
the respon@@ dents who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something prohibited by T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent of the mill@@ enni@@ als compared to less than 15 percent owned by the X generation .
the most common items intentionally passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent admitted that know@@ ingly carried items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it was asking travellers all over the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling goods had brought s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling goods by airport security and how many had been pur@@ pos@@ ely done .
it is no surprise that the people who were the most likely s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling merchandise - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry on the safety , those who were most often flying .
the company however points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often uncertain about which liquids they are allowed to take , or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of items conf@@ is@@ cated by T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
for a while the people thought that T@@ SA could look at books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling goods .

electric @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to give up with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
in doing so , he has so far under@@ lined that a part of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever @-@ trium@@ phant sales figures and even more gigantic sales figures , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed a different , less gl@@ it@@ tering figure for the first time in the announcement of the latest quar@@ terly balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k frequently had recru@@ ited more than 500@@ ,000 orders for the new car , whose ex@@ tradition is just beginning .
now , Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 reservations , 6@@ 3.000 times have already been withdrawn .
critics have always pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( 1000 US Dollars and the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reserv@@ ations Payment &quot; in full .
at present 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations acc@@ ru@@ e , clean up Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all models will be taken together in 2018 - 500@@ ,000 by 2020 , a million by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are 1800 reservations per day .
who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today , can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 with delivery - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new , never @-@ tested production lines with maximum utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to major delays , the liability of the reservations might become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA Chief P@@ ru@@ itt re@@ members the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions due to the postpon@@ ement of the rules of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a
one day after being depl@@ ored by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Authority , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency proved to be responsive to the needs of the state environment authorities to respond quicker than previous administr@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not mention the suit filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
it is about a deadline that expi@@ red on 1 October for states to comply with O@@ zone &apos;s o@@ zone standards for 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance by one year to give its authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfere in local decisions or im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma before his appointment , was a long time a reliable opponent of strict environmental protection regulations .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly been committed to blocking or del@@ aying regulations involving the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ e regulatory roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded their authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , which obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards was simply the willingness of the EP@@ O to co @-@ operate with the states by the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in former administr@@ ations , the EPA has often not kept the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waited to be accused of activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement set the date for the execution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we take the law and the authority that gives it to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the EPA statement concluded that at some point P@@ ru@@ itt will use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; to ensure that the provisions are &quot; based on sound policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress push for a more comprehensive revision of the o@@ zone rules .
a draft law approved last month is expected to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet put to vote in the Senate .
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of States who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the group wanted to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schnei@@ der@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York included in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone originates when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources respond in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year will contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of the public health sector and the environ@@ ment@@ alist che@@ ered on a sudden change of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d of Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ our celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z seren@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors Tum@@ lin@@ gens to their request .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphasizes : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Ur@@ kunden@@ buch : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the hill with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the wording of the document , on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the former parish church , there was also a magnificent court where the Church or the patron saint belonged , and not vice versa .
so there were also people living there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt starting from 18@@ 58 , next to the Unter@@ dorf and Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible in the village scene of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Berg &quot; is the third , the beautiful settlement nucle@@ us of the village .
old maps from the time around 1600 are proof of these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age was derived from the early medieval right of the Church .
a gent@@ leman who built a church and occupied with a priest still remained the owner of this church and could bequ@@ e@@ ath his own church .
associated with this was the right to use a pastor or to suggest a new priest to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the largest of the two were cerem@@ oni@@ ally torn down at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell then sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 @-@ 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bells were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church stack and used it as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed .
only the bell tower was left standing .
in the New Year &apos;s Night , 18@@ 34 , a storm broke the steep@@ le and half collap@@ sed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the tower that still exists today was preserved as a witness to the 750 years old church history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em take care of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schaff@@ haus@@ er Rent@@ meister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as success@@ ors of Dieter Dock@@ horn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as organis@@ ers , the friends and supporters of Tum@@ l@@ gens invite for the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade to the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle on Sunday 16 July .
this will be shaped by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler High School Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann is talking about the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
to the end of the seren@@ ade , a drink takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organis@@ ers set out the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for tum@@ ours and hear@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the friends and supporters of Tum@@ bl@@ aut feel particularly committed to home care , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
association wants to allow approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim war@@ ms itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirement for construction and has therefore turned to the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim war@@ dens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has asked Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , as at that time in Vier@@ sen , only at the city border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal there existed a wind power concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ don &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette by a change of the land use plan - but this was not approved by the Düsseldorf District government due to a form error .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval certificate is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to be withdrawn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Er@@ k@@ ens , President of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council once again decided to enter the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , and a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is where the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been received by the circle Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle makes her the occasion to examine the matter once more .
they probably do not lead to the fact that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; looking at running processes at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the arguments of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a new subsidiary of the NEW , is planning to build four wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the town Vier@@ sen contributed indirectly , closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - equivalent to about one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s city coun@@ cill@@ or gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg district .
car and tractor crashes : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was wounded in death .
two further persons were slightly injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
following police instructions , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch entered the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as an accompanying person .
city and tra@@ der plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ ei@@ a@@ er and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city center .
the commercial club and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th in order to l@@ ure the inhabitants to the city center .
like the chairman of the Gewerbe@@ verein , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ tise customers , which offers the own city away from the usual supermarket commodity .
accordingly , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic companies should present themselves with their training places .
in addition , the shops of the city center will invite for &quot; midnight shopping . &quot;
the campaign aims not only for residents of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation were advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , which point to the action weekend , so Christian König .
city administration and commercial association co @-@ operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
this means that the commercial association and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive Down@@ town . &quot;
this includes new offers such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to the Brun@@ nen@@ fest together with sales on Sunday , talks with all professionals and hosts in order to make them active .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the aband@@ on@@ ment of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be newly or re @-@ opened .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center while shopping .
in the end everyone would have to contribute to li@@ ven the city centre - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs .
it was time to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that was partly wi@@ dening , King said in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities are participating in the nationwide third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Industry and of many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his buying behaviour .
two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
during construction work , a gas explosion occurred in the school building .
new other people were injured .
in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them difficult .
according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , a l@@ ately was in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) .
one person died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed .
a first missing was later also found dead .
the deaths were employees of the school .
as a result , the authorities considered working on a gas pipeline .
at the time of the holiday , only a few people stopped at the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy building .
Tr@@ ump put under pressure after en@@ forced tran@@ scription of phone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump called for a telephone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to to publicly declare that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US President rebu@@ ked him because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise of establishing a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump , Mr. Turn@@ bull , said that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; dump@@ p &quot; after having proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists kidn@@ ap ra@@ cial ly@@ n@@ ching as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in the Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men emerged with guns to block his path .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle stri@@ pe suit - took a long train on his ci@@ gar and g@@ lan@@ ced at the wind@@ screen .
inside the occup@@ ants were in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man shou@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger &apos;s seat .
thank@@ fully , this horrible scene played on July 22nd was just a post @-@ post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience hit very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 civil rights activists come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night where two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were as@@ sailed by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of mur@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps organizing the post @-@ employment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of Georgia State and a life @-@ long citizen .
for him , the post @-@ employment serves as a dramatic appeal to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need to get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bai@@ li@@ ff puts a blanket on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chens on 27 July 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 Mon@@ roe and the surrounding mo@@ ons were suspected in the Lyn@@ ching process .
but no one was ever accused .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the open for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court made it possible for the black citizens to vote in Georgia for the first time in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the election , according to the FB@@ I , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com had a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , such as the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they went away from prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b ring@@ ed the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removed pro@@ ofs and obsc@@ ured the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , then this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their depic@@ tion is vivid , gri@@ pping and is based on a kind of deep rac@@ ism , many of which would like to believe that it no longer exists in America .
it is hard to watch , and even harder to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ch , because then we are confronted with his ug@@ liness in us all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t establish a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I &apos;ve done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of the black - crowded into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is Gre@@ ene &apos;s co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ co for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors D@@ rius Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , who cri@@ es cri@@ es and pus@@ hes him , fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he win@@ ch away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
An@@ cona then respon@@ ds to the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs best .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked An@@ cona . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people then &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black performers wit@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman clothed with a mour@@ ning dress stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and introduces Bil@@ lie Holidays from mour@@ ning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their voice breaks every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen viewers wi@@ pes sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many just come down the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive moisture for nearly eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch mur@@ ders took place , the air feels gh@@ ost@@ ly .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and to inspect the dead bodies .
children sit at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene ow@@ es the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ ord and wipe their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who has played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona wra@@ ps two of his fellow players and breaks down in their arms crying , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks out with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that it is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did it for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience meets with the actors for dinner together .
at one table a white pair of Atlanta aw@@ akes excit@@ edly about the post @-@ position with a black couple that they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find out what feelings the performance left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching still continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , he holds Broo@@ ks &apos;s court at his table , he eats and rec@@ alls ci@@ vic rights .
he said he had already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ employment is inspiring in a way , as it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf will focus on a colourful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous performance against a giant , six @-@ storey backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Alek@@ sand@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) optionally shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with wall rest and d@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ster and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car park in which the Rhine @-@ le@@ aner as a rock energy pose , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ mo@@ tiv - money , power and gre@@ ed - moving through his &quot; Ring &quot; production .
the three Rhine @-@ kill@@ ers - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
K@@ ES@@ S se@@ duce her Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , ro@@ de a cor@@ p@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ style and give the Kra@@ mmi@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the wonderfully fu@@ eled Ha@@ gen that surrounds the aura of a wei@@ ght@@ box .
brut@@ ally the scene when he was driving Siegfried .
later also Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still has to believe in it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with powerful applause .
Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are wild@@ ly celebrated , who mo@@ dest@@ ly bend their hands to Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the high heat again in casual leisure wear .
Frank Cast@@ orf and his team were eag@@ erly awa@@ ited with excitement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he had to let go of a bright pipe concert on himself , there were five years later a great jubil@@ ation in which the occasional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ t@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is glad to have enjoyed this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one notices that the audience with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has somehow grown together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also an understanding of their views .
I prefer a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where to find anywhere ?
crowd : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture exchange , once a week I am working here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have also worked at school on the open day of the day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are 26 years now , so a late @-@ called volunteer .
how does that happen ?
lot : I have finished Ab@@ itur .
and then a degree in civil engineering , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off .
I realized that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
make a social year , since there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , in the focal point perhaps also , really is .
and was it so ?
crowd : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , I am likely to study as a dual , and I am studying in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you are doing his FS@@ J .
you can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different from civil engineering ?
amount : well , here it &apos;s not about calculating boo@@ kl@@ es .
there are always other people in front of each other , each having a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee or a youth who has been brought out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have reservations ?
crowd : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
much love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pear@@ son reduces further 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business &quot; &quot; &quot;
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that they will reduce more than 3,000 jobs and cut their divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure facing the company .
in addition to its previous restructuring , the workforce reduction , which General Director John Fall@@ on announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , is in addition to his previous restructuring .
in May Pear@@ son announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May in a third cost @-@ cutting program to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to its partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after achieving an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
con@@ vo@@ y attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in Kab@@ ul , Afghanistan &apos;s capital , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured and declared a NATO statement .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians were killed in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that has hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a NATO statement it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by an impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and treated at B@@ agra@@ m in the US military hospital .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of which about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ ber killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite District of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had carried out this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack of the country since the US @-@ led troops displaced the Tali@@ ban from power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops to support the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aled that states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this occurred a day after 15 states accused the Agency because of the stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced the decision late on Wednesday to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said that they show the obligation of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in the dialogue and that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA Chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced plans for EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which emissions must be measured in a part of the country , in order to determine where inc@@ isions must be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which , according to Tr@@ ump , should stimulate economic growth .
however , the efforts have triggered the demoli@@ tion of the Democrats and nature conservation groups concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ing air containing o@@ zone can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and strengthen respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
common room wants common room
in the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn win@@ k decides to set up a common room in the future retirement home .
prior to the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the remaining part of the property is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will still take time until the church community has so far belonged to the church community , there is no planning obstacle for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the municipality .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living area - approximately 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace with a surface area of 70 square metres for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council would like to see such a common room not as a meeting place for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ous living , but openly into the congregation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ cafe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision that has been decided by the provision of funds for the current household will be decided by funding opportunities already last autumn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is located in the area of renovation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of a common room would be , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says T@@ j@@ aden , endow@@ ed with 60 percent by 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proposal is to signal the investor that in this respect he does not want to throw a bil@@ let between the legs , the finding that both saddle and seat construction is le@@ aning against - as well as the pent roof - which reduces the height of the tr@@ uss and makes the construction more economical - possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this additive .
when it helps : unanim@@ ously , he passes the body .
it &apos;s not that easy with the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many of his own buildings , with which you don &apos;t get going that way , but now you lean into the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger condi@@ tionally speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it sees behind it a hidden subsi@@ dy of any already wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a real equivalent value which can be market@@ able in case of doubt .
Sta@@ eni@@ er &apos;s request to apply the proposed resolution is three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with two counter@@ parts the original programme , Stefan H@@ aller summari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we take the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
colli@@ sions by car : cycli@@ st is thrown at the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and was severely injured .
as the police informed , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was travelling with his bike on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer from direction Hil@@ den on the way .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver who is driving in the same direction has given priority to him .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder proce@@ eded onto the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the traffic .
he met with a car that controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was taken to hospital with a return carriage .
Bayern Munich must disp@@ ense with David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago at the World Cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to take the action against Dortmund .
FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory field of the new season with staff worries .
seven pro@@ s are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
the personnel worries at German football record champion Bayern München are getting bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
in du@@ el with the BV@@ B , coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to do without David Al@@ aba .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has made responsible the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was not good at last . &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season .
&quot; football is also a tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German soccer heav@@ y@@ weights captiv@@ ates the fans .
the game was sold out with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 spectators , distributed the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
w@@ ander from star to star in resin
in the resin the nation @-@ wide first &quot; Star@@ path &quot; is to be created .
this is planned by the Association Observ@@ atory St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a Plan@@ etary Trail in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star@@ base &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; met the information needs of many visitors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he brings together nature , science , movement and sporting performance .
the members want to er@@ ect tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in question came St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be supplemented by internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the choice of location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the Star@@ path turn should be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the nature trail , the viewers experience a lot of worth knowing , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is more lumin@@ ous than another , even though it is far more distant .
also , in which con@@ stellation you can find a selected star and when it is best to see .
since 2014 , the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest stell@@ ar observ@@ atory in northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the site in the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with the naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 there has been something like the planned star@@ ship - the Plan@@ etary Trail on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen .
starting in front of the Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel at the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e that forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the Observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; off @-@ ground &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to de@@ grade to the d@@ warf planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeter diameter , while the exactly 75 meters distance the sun measures 70 centimet@@ ers .
the total distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
while the light from Sun to Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour until the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are therefore faster than light in space .
the march to the next fixed star , however , would last for half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future at 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , went down the corridor to greet Lom@@ at@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization Super Feder@@ weight Champion .
following Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ di@@ visional world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ on@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the pair posed for photos , Lom@@ at@@ enko &apos;s manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia rec@@ alled .
&quot; I went up for Bron@@ er &#91; at 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not that big .
I am small for 140 .
I would like to run down to light weight .
and he must move to light weight @-@ weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this is asking the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ at@@ enko was right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
climate asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight this year with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) which also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later openly expressed himself openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; count Lom@@ at@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ at@@ enko was gra@@ cious to Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks that the three @-@ fight champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to do the co @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show strength , then boxes .
they both said that they could sense the momentum created for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four injured to tyre plat@@ ter
four people were seriously injured during an accident at the A@@ 7 on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a was able to lose control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the market , shortly before the end of the market .
the passenger car hur@@ led to the right into the slope , where he over@@ turned and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service the A@@ 7 was locked in direction north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three @-@ chain works better &quot;
and@@ re Hoffmann is hoping for the 2 : 2 to kick off the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that optimi@@ zes the defensive formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first round of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the result , not the two opponents would have been against Braunschweig on 2 : 2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to adapt even better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una Düsseldorf def@@ enses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ chain needs to be further optimized .
and a gate after a free hit doesn &apos;t want to capture the For@@ tun@@ en anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that no one besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) puts himself on line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team gets better even after the experience in preparation with the three @-@ chain , than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to operate in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have just worked in the three @-@ chain in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gieß@@ el@@ mann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we are still better harmon@@ izing and we don &apos;t have so many mistakes in the setup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak of a failed start after a decision , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can get four points on Sunday and concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to talk about a regular season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer did not want to know about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only judge the start into the season after six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be stopped pre@@ mat@@ urely due to an accident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might be even a little fres@@ her , as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know as 100 percent where they are at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Minister of the Interior of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the Rhin@@ eland as a light favourite on Sunday , guests from the Rhin@@ eland come to the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep it away just because we have the right to come under the first six is non@@ sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which one has to beat in advance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish Asyl@@ um Application Test published
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who were subjected to a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ ens@@ ische Medizin ( Rä@@ t@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has begun to carry out the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the app@@ rais@@ al of the age after the Swedish migration agency ( migration pan@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
Mig@@ ration@@ al@@ et has sent out 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to date and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly under 18 years old &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person has been judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May the Agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases which &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she found out that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , X @-@ ray imaging of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critici@@ zed in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the En@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of humans , in order to see if they went through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judging the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot confi@@ dently say , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of ass@@ essing a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is if the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the provincial road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
a total of seven tons of heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very well in time , it &apos;s going great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , head of construction at the Department of Traffic and Transport in the Regier@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the works began at the same time on all three refur@@ bish@@ ment @-@ needy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is maintained .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete coated with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has meanwhile arrived in the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning on the northern side received a 1,@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons weigh@@ ted bridge deck .
this is an edge fixing system , which is also used as an operating mode .
on Friday , a 2.@@ 20 metre wide bridge deck is to be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to get lost .
the special thing is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ sp@@ itz@@ feeling has required laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , to which many companies are connected .
prior to the work , the residents were informed about the project by hand@@ rails .
in addition , fish and cra@@ bs had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building yard and the bus@@ h@@ way in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by traffic lights .
for the construction work on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is completely blocked .
the cost of the three bridge refur@@ bish@@ ments amounts to 700 000 Euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : protest with German Pot@@ ato Sal@@ at
it is not so common that parties are pulling together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties represented at the Krei@@ sky ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) are part of a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully on this day because the Af@@ D invites to a &quot; great election campaign &quot; in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle , R@@ ond@@ ell .
and known names to the start - such as Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land is the leading duo for the election of the Bundestag on September 24 , and the deputy head of the Federal Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot for hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ speakers but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colorful &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the city picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place on the parking lot below the Ro@@ un@@ del - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the forum One World and one of the leading organis@@ ers , really pleased : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is music and lots of food , among them a &quot; rustic potato salad , which the Af@@ D could easily eat , &quot; says the woman who brought it along .
the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , they show presence especially at the station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D vul@@ can@@ ic sulph@@ ur reports that he was striving for such an event and got the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there is not enough parking available .
now the f@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
this is what it does : around 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ el forec@@ our@@ t , several speakers in the Stad@@ thalle , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D Chairman Uwe Junge .
there are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the top candidate to speak for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chair@@ person Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can move away - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sts Freder@@ ic B@@ elli will be present in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ man@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the monastery church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the Bulgarian trumpet Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; applies to classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the principal Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo trumpet of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to transc@@ end borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz ech@@ op@@ rei@@ str@@ ator N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play blend into a fascinating synthesis of synthesis .
this core of the program was premi@@ ered only this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram recorded it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try out everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart quite openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the best @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was their &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who dealt with bitter@@ ly in the end .
despite all this , the be@@ amed performer ass@@ ures the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with anyone I have taken .
or do you think I had played it ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and believed it seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it never interfer@@ ed or obstruc@@ ted me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have never liked to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially among them she suffered , according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but in school time , when she loved to dress like a bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public doesn &apos;t like to declare their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from all the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the Party
the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of reflections ... today I will say to you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you when I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump previously promised a big announcement at West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he has coal power in five states , and he inherited a coal store from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather hin@@ der us than to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is the final rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , unanim@@ ous message , &quot; said R@@ NC President Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the world leader for athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as a clear excuse from Russia for a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he reiter@@ ated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sport .
Russian athle@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics world championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the athletes , who were taken away with gold and silver med@@ als in competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his commentary , the IA@@ AF congress approved the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to the repor@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognized by itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to accept that Russia accepts the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to normal@@ ise this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle always was that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world championships taking place on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still fulfil some of the criteria for re @-@ adjustment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
funeral ceremony for soldiers crashed in Mali
at a funeral service in the north @-@ Hes@@ sian F@@ ritz@@ lar , approximately 1000 people of the two were thought of by a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security arrangements .
on the other hand , Defense Minister Ursul@@ a von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing about the still un@@ explained matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they described the two opposite pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons of their professional &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to this supreme sacrifice which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old chief of staff from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to live in Mali on Wednesday a week ago .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er cathedral Sankt Peter on Thursday .
at noon , only the members of the church took f@@ arewell .
after that , the funeral service in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics began .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the German Federal Ar@@ med Forces Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
ro@@ ses put down grapes , the relatives were arm in arm on the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers persecuted the ceremony on a screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister of Defense of the Le@@ yen called the fallen soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and ra@@ zed in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had set up the flight operations of the combat helicopter Tiger at F@@ ritz@@ lar and had been one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment , to which the soldiers belong , said : &quot; if the crew could not turn away the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
in response to the UN mission in Mali , Prime Minister von der Le@@ yen did not show that deployment would be dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this was shared by the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , so she continued to communicate .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , it is still unclear .
but he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become a king .
in 2016 he retired and also took the title &quot; Prinz@@ reg@@ al . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the leader of the Danish royal house , explained .
where the final resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
but he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bl@@ eman , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London in 1965 .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French Embassy .
during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had a grave stand with the Dan@@ es during his 50 @-@ year reign .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik testified about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was swe@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stum@@ ps instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of society @-@ critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be content with this position and not ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were just two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants to quickly re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the resolution of parliament voted on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprise res@@ ignation of a Green party from its Land@@ tag fraction in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ voice majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen combined their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she announced on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U president , Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ur@@ ler , wants to recommend his group to include them .
as a result , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
until now , the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected regular on January 14 next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; red @-@ green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; state government should now decide whether it could continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it essential that the country &apos;s day resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s parliament ev@@ ades the trust and el@@ ects a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be legally insp@@ ected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ur@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all questions will be discussed in peace if they are legally audi@@ bly tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she described herself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the back@@ sliding parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume , of course , that they return their land @-@ to @-@ day mandate , which they have received via the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the pres@@ idents of Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she deliberately decided not to take any pron@@ unciation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no substan@@ tive differences , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betra@@ yal of voters but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Federal President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to make the Land parliament new .
the leaving of the West costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her injured marri@@ ages and fru@@ stration had her personal interests before the well @-@ being of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD general secretary Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony has contributed to this dirty tri@@ logy and attempts to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sachsen CD@@ U Group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ur@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ westen in the CD@@ U .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ westen of fal@@ si@@ fying the outcome of the 2013 State Parliament election with a personal career .
the CD@@ U was the strongest force at that time before the SPD , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one vote in the Parliament &apos;s day .
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from gre@@ ed , Herr Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the editorial board Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect himself from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to check carefully the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ Lebensmittel@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states present the latest information about the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
also , if after all we know what we currently know , a health risk is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enligh@@ ten@@ er is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless my house has stopped immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the sad@@ ness of Germany .
all information and risk assessments are available to consumers .
as well as producers , trade has to ensure that the sold products are safe and harmless to health .
if the residual oil content of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not traffic @-@ capable .
un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time , not the factories are to blame .
are production plants and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
according to current state of knowledge , production plants do not cause immediate guilt .
rather , due to the presum@@ ed il@@ lic@@ it practices of service companies , they must reck@@ on with economic damage .
as always , there is too little check@@ ers in the case of emer@@ gen@@ cies .
is there only a lack of personnel or a coherent competence ?
it was just the official controls that uncovered the process .
the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 % excluded .
it is precisely because of this that a consequ@@ ent clari@@ fication of such events and the transfer to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences may be available are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made a clear statement that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment by the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular alarm in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to get only safe and market@@ able food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are indign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by means of the pan@@ eled means , manufacturers , retailers and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide fi@@ pron@@ il in keeping food @-@ safe animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
it is important to work consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all competent authorities that the facts will be elu@@ ci@@ dated quickly and without gaps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the Fis@@ cal Rules of Football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the guiding organisation that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious UEF@@ A Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules launched by the UEF@@ A in 2011 mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PS@@ G can surely make money loose for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the wealthy ruler family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but must counter with legitimate income sources which allow them to break even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , which in their quest for success had taken enormous debts , were effectively dec@@ ei@@ ving and ris@@ king to ruin when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P shifted from concentration on the debt of the clubs to monitoring their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea , bought a club with potential and then invested strongly in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er affair .
during the current three @-@ year period of FF@@ P , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the pres@@ idency in 2015 , his successor Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to be deter@@ red by excessive spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will surely reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared with The Associated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a l@@ ump sum , it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the revenue streams for the next five years amounting to EUR 4@@ 4.4 million can be reported in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of EU FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was lowered to 20 million euros later - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
UEF@@ A is on the look@@ out for clubs that could try to out@@ wi@@ t their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ ar@@ gic company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered a legitimate income .
this is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar on payments by the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 2022 .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar World Championship ambass@@ adors will be promoted and a great manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could be easy to figure out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to ignore any attempt to circum@@ vent rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they talked about the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associated Press , since they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
accounts for the last financial year must be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot purchases .
the association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signing of the contract .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s going away by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership to PS@@ G .
Ar@@ senal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ ons , divi@@ des the reservations of La League against a state that finances an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is on the look@@ out for a new creator
chocolate Fre@@ y has produced choc@@ ol@@ ates for Swiss in recent years .
now the sweet cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline re@@ writes the contract anew .
on request of the news agency , Swiss @-@ speaking Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will contract a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very happy with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the speaker .
some 17 million small red @-@ and @-@ white bul@@ k@@ board sheets of 14 grams per year distribute flight atten@@ d@@ ants to the passengers prior to landing .
Swiss didn &apos;t want to give details about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a manufacturer of sho@@ em@@ akers .
the Swiss does not want to reveal how many candidates do in the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers are eligible for this .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract over the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .
Swiss Life has been distributing choc@@ ol@@ ates on board their flights since 2006 .
before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry Cal@@ le@@ baut had supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
Swiss Life took the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works together with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long haul flights the First Class customers will be pam@@ pered with goo@@ dies from the confection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i from Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sho@@ gg@@ i from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Sho@@ gg@@ i from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class , also distri@@ butes the short distance .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of the story is nostal@@ gic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ years gr@@ unge era ( as the think@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch @-@ com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd were going to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like the time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly good , not only because of his absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a talking tin of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by sti@@ cking to the core of the bag - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children who will grow up - they nevertheless managed to regain the im@@ possibility to regain the last part of the weather .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adult who now play adults , is less emotional rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the casting @-@ like principle , among them a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character goes through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the ami@@ able co@@ op ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now a Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ vi@@ cious plot in which Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good sung impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos; mou@@ sta@@ che &apos; Sing@@ les &apos; , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker .
these are the moments of random ins@@ anity that could fuel this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he achieves that which I consider his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the gang how they will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now rec@@ alls a different sort of nostal@@ gia : reminiscent of the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; the movie &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West Ring@@ war icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Greg@@ or and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alo@@ gues from Ch@@ anning Tart@@ um ( also a full producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are synchron@@ ised in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice flags to look ( the police spend time watching chess on television as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the Voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask - that it often plays like a single .
with six long episodes , it is moving away , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was edited down to a lower length , could better deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , as Greg@@ or and I@@ os@@ ef continuously visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a pile of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make all the food for a ban@@ quet .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with theirs .
blow to drug ma@@ fia in the country
the police managed to strike the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar district in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart .
at the same time , 15 accused persons aged 25 and 77 were arrested and arrest warran@@ ts had already been issued against them .
in addition , officials made large amounts of mar@@ ihu@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
two people were arrested for the same ra@@ ids in Italy .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
the two are probably shipped to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
a total of more than 300 police officers were deployed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organised drug crime , serious violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating const@@ ancy against organised drug traffi@@ cking in southern Germany .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the large @-@ scale deployment was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the investigation focused mainly on Italian nation@@ als with close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired up in a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
sage beg@@ s major gaps in the foreig@@ ner &apos;s register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions on asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the commission@@ er for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to large gaps in the country &apos;s central register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; warned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the records , it is estimated that ten million people with foreign citizenship are registered , including about 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data had not been adequately maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 had been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should actually no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faulty data inputs can slow reverse processes considerably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states the report further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , in statistics about sufficient people , EU citizens are also included who do not have to leave .
such false arrangements , however , &quot; led to a distorted debate on how to deal with exc@@ uses , &quot; it says in the analysis .
meanwhile , the Federal Government obviously started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they came from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper says that &quot; BA@@ MF leads such procedures &quot; concerning families with children , with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 this was practically no longer possible , so the paper was pointing to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach it first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant continues to move to another EU country , this state can return it to the entry country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reason is now : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the recording capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased considerably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement .
the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten un@@ lawful recording conditions for the defici@@ encies in the Italian asylum system and a threat to child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach already provided blood don@@ or service for other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
first of all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who meanwhile distributed 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , the congregation acknowled@@ ges multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood during the meeting of the Council of the Community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is brilliant how our bodies are laid out and we pay respect to the don@@ ors that make their blood available to foreigners , still un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the round@@ about leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the preserved foods are broken down into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported on the actions performed in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K round@@ ab@@ et@@ aker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years ago , the switch to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants .
previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Rei@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry counted among the multiple donations and were awarded for 50 committed blood donations .
half as many thanks to Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ oth@@ ee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter spent ten times per 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice .
Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the policy makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members striving to increase since weak economic growth has weakened support for up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment .
in its quar@@ terly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the fall .
but it sign@@ alized that interest increases would be necessary in the next few years to cur@@ b the inflation stimulated by Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that the loan costs might rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw part of the M@@ amm@@ ut economic stimulus package published one year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will require time to finance the financing plan to provide cheaper banks for banks from the forthcoming February , although it was said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the bank said : &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot;
in addition to interest rates , it reiter@@ ated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for cooling inflation and a slightly larger &quot; scale than the markets expect .
the markets currently forecast the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank emphas@@ ised that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the growth forecasts adjusted down@@ wards for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to these messages over the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures damp@@ ened the rising expectations of interest income and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months has risen to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to fall by 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover easily after the end of the year .
the recent inflation forecast provided little enthusiasm for households being affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases , as the tigh@@ tening first becomes even worse before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; income in the coming years , but she added that wages are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also boo@@ sted by the rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pound , which will compensate for some of the lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes one year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the shock@@ ing EU vote that caused the fall of the pound .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully achieve the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s last judgment on interest rates , the call for interest rates rose as inflation increased its pressure on hard @-@ pressed budgets , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July .
inflation decreased by 2.@@ 9 % last month in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and will attract them in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the excess in relation to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wholly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attributable to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lak@@ on , director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline in swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking for businesses lou@@ dly and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those who run out the existing deals and conclude the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trans@@ form@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight in the N@@ HS in September after a fight in front of the High Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ sexual pro@@ phyla@@ xis introduced before sexual intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ als confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year , confirming that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while the National A@@ ids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to make the registration of people possible , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infectious areas .
taking pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or as long as two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also opt for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the entire potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence as it is used extensively , recorded and implemented on a large scale .
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in more than three decades of continuing progress in tackl@@ ing one of humanity &apos;s biggest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National A@@ ids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
when targeted at people in need and endangered people , pre@@ p offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September on people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Executive Board of Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is conducted swiftly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine has been procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on H@@ od@@ g@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how trans@@ form@@ ative this drug may be as a part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is conducted as soon as possible throughout the country to protect persons infected with HIV and that it will contribute to bringing a step closer to the termination of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
live the great life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank with a passion for real estate , res@@ ig@@ ned from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack and sell her bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add a closet space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that was my requirement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose they commissioned the Architecture and Design@@ studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12@@ ,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an mezzanine in which one could stand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively in order to solve the task . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the ste@@ el@@ work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement made it possible for Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it work for a longer time .
in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all cutlery and j@@ ars by Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
collap@@ sible kitchens are nothing new .
what is special about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is counter@@ weight so that when you push the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne was able to win an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and conduct a calculation based on the soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor surface and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and that will help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself by good design and increased square footage of some standard to something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to not leave this .
brothers fighting for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a dispute because of one of the biggest real estate imperial Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors away from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business should be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family purchased a business at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 .
there , the West@@ co Jeans family founded je@@ ans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate , and the De Lu@@ tis portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the subur@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after an agreement with her late father Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is described in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul roughly one third . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in &apos;s ownership of $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opinions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the Brothers now also fight for control of the existing business , which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , has ruled out .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to manage some possessions in@@ competent .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the quar@@ rel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs increase , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held law firms .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a business in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to purchase the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the family &apos;s first je@@ ans .
Col@@ in says he started West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to give her property to her sons gra@@ ci@@ ously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land at court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , where Col@@ in claims that Mark has paid $ 10 million on leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in with@@ drew quite a bit , although he was a former AF@@ L member of the board and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our affair will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly really can do it .
if so , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece by Repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with man@@ ag@@ erial staff on his first working day , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House that he wanted to fix : poor information falling into the hands of the president . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly said to the staff that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys Diag@@ nosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame dr@@ ump by monitoring their media own .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump has been angry for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were to be persu@@ aded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said former electoral advisor Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keeping Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; habit was to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter practice was ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know for others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets would have included even more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump did not send .
if his employees managed to keep him out of trouble for a few times , their efforts were worth it .
but nobody has been able to prevent dr@@ ump controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , are always trying to present their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material that perhaps promotes their views of the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - entirely occupied with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ dil@@ ection of advis@@ ors to lead the President from strategic reasons dou@@ bt@@ ful information .
this was an example described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recent and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump , like a volcano , can react to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he tries to find out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ci@@ ously accused the president of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the internet pro@@ voc@@ ateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson has been permanently ban@@ ished from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ ane or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and began asking employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; gold@@ smith added that the then Chief of Staff of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that work out ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get post from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped for .
the police across Europe send out post@@ cards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) .
since the addresses of the most sought @-@ after heavy criminals are not known naturally , references from the population will be hoped and asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reports on Friday from the action following the Winter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adv@@ ent calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences had shown that many fle@@ eting holidays were hiding in holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have put together 21 post@@ cards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ art , which has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online requests could have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to evidence after the publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again with some def@@ en@@ ched travellers on war@@ time , who have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the community to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous street of Soli@@ hull which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Million@@ aire Series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans after they were thrown out only in May without being deter@@ red by the gra@@ bs dug by the Council in order to prevent their invasion .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ obstruc@@ ted to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have urged the Council of Soli@@ hull who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council needs to be forced by shame to implement it , since it was useless in dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are back again .
more arrived yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my local charge if the Council does not even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local who did not want to be called , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travelers , only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a speaker of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps to allow them to move as quickly as possible .
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birken@@ hof to Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is made up of the former Hotel Birken@@ hof .
the house at the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt will be renovated and will be re@@ opened on March 1st next year .
they are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the Hotel Birken@@ hof by the former Ambiente Company Ges@@ mbH on April 13 , 2014 , approximately 30,000 over@@ nights per year were lost and also income by the tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , in view of the dramatic increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered to the district office as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a planning plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ard &apos;s Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald def@@ ends the site and at that time spoke of serious interested parties to the house .
he was to be right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ das with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house in the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
they are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof have been building break@@ ages before the entrance for some time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are carried out .
the floors were torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs were removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still a lot to do .
&quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the black @-@ and @-@ white style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautiful natur@@ alistic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but even on a high @-@ level inner city level , Sch@@ erer emphas@@ ises .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already led talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so sh@@ a@@ vers .
the no@@ tions of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to set a precise definition of the amount of investments .
just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the exterior plants are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is open to the public by the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us Special Inter@@ medi@@ ate sets out Grand Jury
in the Russia affair headed by US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have set up a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the committee recorded the work , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; referring to people familiar with the subject . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensified its investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ cast@@ ed reported that there were already first charges of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence services have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for some time now , to be targeted at the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations there are several men who acted as advis@@ ers to the re@@ public@@ ans in the election campaign .
as a result , Mu@@ eller took a close look at more and more tr@@ um@@ ps in a private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Ob@@ server Tr@@ ump has personally moved to the centre and for@@ examining whether the president may have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand J@@ uries is to examine this evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether it should be charged .
Grand J@@ uries are therefore also called anch@@ oring sp@@ amm@@ ers .
they are mostly turned on when these are larger and controversial cases .
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office in order to invite persons to the company under E@@ id .
according to CN@@ N , pre @-@ invitations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps coun@@ s@@ ellor and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his former election campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort also attended the discussion .
legal experts reported on Thursday evening on US TV that the institution proved that Mu@@ eller would not in@@ timi@@ date himself in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end in order to decide on the accus@@ ation of an indictment .
nevertheless , the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the president used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the subject gives the democr@@ ats a way to &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the entry of a Grand Jury .
but he usually works secretly , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House aff@@ ords any action that acceler@@ ates the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intermedi@@ ary in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
former FB@@ I leader James Com@@ ey said three times that not against the president .
there is no reason to assume that something has changed in this regard , it was called forth in the statement .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this re@@ design , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump became loud , he wanted to im@@ pe@@ de the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
comm@@ itting a Senate committee in June , Com@@ ey asked him to stop the investigation against the former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees .
this triggered spec@@ ulation as to whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to dis@@ miss .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later retired president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he theore@@ tically could be fired at the pres@@ idency of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
but several Sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented draft laws on Thursday after which the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator could no longer be released .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg driving in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the western Antar@@ c@@ tica a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg of the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has settled from the ice shelf .
this was shared by the Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , which weighs over a tri@@ l@@ lion tonnes and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now dri@@ fting north and will probably need two , three years until it mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ic@@ eber@@ gs that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
it is not a danger for people .
according to research information , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demoli@@ tion of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
in total , however , there have been a series of unusual inter@@ cep@@ ts of ice el@@ ic@@ iled in the region for around 30 years , the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) writes in a fac@@ simile background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now abor@@ ted col@@ os@@ sus was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ ice flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
it grows further and further into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ sla@@ b lies south of South America almost at the tip of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this ice shelf , the equilibrium of wa@@ xes and break@@ downs occurred a few years ago .
a complete ice shelf is crum@@ bling there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ sla@@ b is in danger , because the front edge has never been as far back as at present .
in addition , the iron plate is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key point .
the melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase sea level , as they float on the water and supp@@ ress ice as much water as follows after melting by itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could increase the sea level , but only to a small extent , is the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ho@@ s is the fourth biggest ice shelf in Antar@@ c@@ tica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres .
at the crossing from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters .
there it breaks off regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural phenomenon and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ ho@@ s will grow back or go back in the long run and possibly coinci@@ de , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers fail to trace this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg &apos;s down@@ fall to climate change , many of the ice @-@ caves of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart during the past few decades .
this long top of Antar@@ c@@ tica covers South America .
according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey research programme , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees in the last 50 years and thus counts to the areas in which the temperature is the quick@@ est .
CD@@ U wants home tari@@ ff at the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U calls for the employer association to become more attractive .
just before the summer break , the circle @-@ day spent 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials are working for the administrative district in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 apprenti@@ ces have their first working day behind them .
the apprentices@@ hips at the circle are obviously very sought @-@ after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were posted for the places to be distributed this year .
nevertheless , the circle continues to lack personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present there are still 50 vac@@ ant passages in the M@@ ett@@ mann circle .
among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG , and face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to meet short @-@ term requirements for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage .
the overall concept should be oriented to the inside and outside , show concrete measures for lateral entran@@ ts and include an education campaign , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contest of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees who are leaving the ministry due to illness or age .
therefore , it is high time for action so that there are no more places left un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he recently took care of a bad surprise in the circle of the circle when he publicly challenged the costs of personnel costs and the rest of the parties ba@@ ff@@ led .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow a discharge from the municipal employers &apos; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the county government should strive for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the unions - perhaps even in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials when it actually envis@@ ages collective bar@@ gaining for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money is only given if one changes to a higher level which is oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution law .
not least due to the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .
Italy sharp@@ ens tone on NGO migrants &apos; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had conf@@ is@@ cated a boat to the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , because their team effectively worked together with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on detailed alleg@@ ations of Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio , an Italian prosec@@ utor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is thought that its crew takes tu@@ din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , which are delivered to them directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can shut off so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was allegedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the deed issued by the prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of dispos@@ ing of the authority of the Italian Coast Guard who over@@ sees the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must first of all have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs that participate in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant changes or obstruc@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign up , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization is Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin Out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the Nor@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs for four days .
three friendly guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and wine festival of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome addition .
the first tour led to the Micha@@ el@@ ier@@ elle above Dei@@ tem@@ heim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards .
observation points were followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were again and again longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ b@@ als rewarded .
on the second day after Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim we went to Sal@@ ine and to the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
again , the look@@ out stood at the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ wer@@ ed &quot; tri@@ angles and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced again .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and return h@@ uts brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed sal@@ tw@@ ater in the open air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga modi@@ fies for e @-@ sport
are the sports stars in future sitting in front of computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium ras@@ hes with wind and weather ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , a profitable business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gar@@ ages included .
the first federal li@@ ais@@ ons have also identified this , which are increasingly involved in this field .
the start of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two pro@@ s for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire all new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is sure that there are still several clubs going up on this train . &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; in which gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , for example , have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football , especially with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ old , has to deal with the fact that young people are still going to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , they could be more often present online in these markets than once a year to send the federal government to Asia .
what is it all about ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the E @-@ sport computer games such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; League of Legends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the football simulation of FIFA on competition level will be fought . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as in normal sport , Li@@ gen has long since established itself , in which the pro@@ s compete against each other .
e @-@ Sport is already part of the official programme for the Asian Games 2022 .
but is it really a kind of sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to it .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sport - e.g. increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , cognitive abilities , technical and tac@@ tical comprehen@@ sion and quick responsi@@ veness are required .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console , but also their body and pay attention to the nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , F@@ rob@@ ber also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls were difficult to carry out on online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing .
the scientists emphasize the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sports .
players are internationally on the move , it &apos;s like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles .
a study by the corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband für Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth for E @-@ Sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to be 130 million .
there is little against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ Sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte Consul@@ tants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries are already abroad .
major markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez take part in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport bet@@ ting vendor Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe some things are happening .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport was introduced as a classroom , says F@@ rob@@ ber .
according to D@@ utt , the football @-@ first league associations in the Netherlands and France are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ ged behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Executive Board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to fall into nostal@@ gia and to glori@@ fy the old times is no longer enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time on the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ sed world , &quot; says D@@ utt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t stick to it , that only football remains as it was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter condemned to suicide because of the lyrics Con@@ rad Roy pushed for suicide
a Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend to commit suicide by writing lyrics and calls .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years ago were abandoned .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted of negli@@ gent killing of Con@@ rad Roy in June , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free of his vocation .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and eyes directed down@@ wards when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life in order to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she took no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they fully regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not find that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day when I do not feel the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for eternity in spite of all my pain that we will be carrying with us for eternity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the knowledge that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not having this only person with whom I have been together since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with myself for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to urge another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang yourself up , spring from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter was paying attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by some press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
one of the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 because of murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ me was allowed to run as captain on the Audi Cup is no accident .
FC Bayern ow@@ es a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm us .
something was different on his place in the cabin , which was Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even if the extra garment was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and neither Manuel Neu@@ er could be seen , he made the split stick to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer did not announce it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the con@@ fed cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as a Bavarian captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the entry could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ me could interpret the sign from the coach too .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f who came from the holidays , de@@ but@@ ant and just out of the holiday .
sugar is most likely to be distributed to those people whom you want to keep in a good mood .
those who have been chosen to take the heritage of L@@ ah@@ m can use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old ple@@ aded the field as a mini @-@ l@@ ame .
to the right of the back , that is his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did her rest .
and in general , Kim@@ am worked in this initial formation as the one who can take the ru@@ dder in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the un@@ well @-@ played tro@@ op .
he had a look at the whole while many others were busy with himself .
Vi@@ dal was not able to over@@ play his missing fitness ( barely folding ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches pointed out that the devil came out to the achievements of the Asian trip ( also only conditional ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le with it not to wake up in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot .
after all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ le ran alongside Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli @-@ storm was often difficult , and in addition , Sü@@ le tried a few times in the build @-@ up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we hoped for &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance in his debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style , I was also fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as un@@ usually this Bavaria @-@ World is still for the new entran@@ ces , one looked after the game .
Ru@@ dy for example did not give in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs one or two , but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ me said good@@ bye after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new anymore .
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s most famous foot@@ b@@ aller shortly before the game was reported via Twitter and the Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ Damen designed all the best .
the Bavarian Legi@@ on@@ ary is a quasi @-@ club of Ö@@ F@@ B captains in Schn@@ a@@ der@@ beck and thri@@ lls with our Lad@@ ys .
the twe@@ et of the Austrian football club of the year and champi@@ ons League winner should be a special motiv@@ ational sy@@ ringe .
maybe our ladies might also need the famous Bavaria @-@ Dus@@ el .
company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ dom Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ ser ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies in the region speak of a change in economic policy on T V demand - and at the same time blame the old minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bis@@ sing touches the desires of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ us sees the largest turn@@ around in infrastructure policy : the brid@@ ging of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year the ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 the construction law is to stand .
the West Bank of Trier will play a role in the plans of the country , which stands in the urgent need of the federal transport plan .
the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minister @-@ Spe@@ aker Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
in this , Nat@@ us sees a sign for supporting regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier is striving for a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ label , as suggested by Wis@@ ser , to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German exports going over for ten years .
in addition , bis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , the Chamber of Commerce appl@@ au@@ ds .
in the new master bonus , the Chamber of Crafts Trier has an additional incentive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a bonus of 1000 Euros is fores@@ een for the passing championship test and € 2,500 if graduates make themselves self @-@ employed within ten years after the master training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
in the planned road construction , facts have to be created quickly , at the same time lacking the country the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce of Trier .
only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to hire Wis@@ ser for the mobility of the state .
the Chamber encourages more orders to be awarded to external offices .
in addition , CD@@ U fac@@ t@@ vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors that the country invested more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated power supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey only with a score of 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about stagn@@ ant internet connections and out@@ breaks .
ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke for April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she already cleared the field after four months of ir@@ regul@@ arities .
Audi aims to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a back@@ lash
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said it would offer to update the software to more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW president said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a call@@ back .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of car manufacturers to install exhaust gases ex@@ cre@@ ted from diesel vehicles also increases , making it difficult to keep cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of har@@ assing the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called switch @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were charged , others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi into the study could seriously affect Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s win .
this message has the raft on Saturday on the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft is driving through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message .
if you take a closer look at the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and this is not a usual raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the construction department wants to clarify .
on the raft you can see a big info @-@ sco@@ oter .
it shows a Müll@@ berg .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a public campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; shall shar@@ pen our understanding of the Is@@ ar as a protected wild river . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer the raft drove over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behaviour .
Mor@@ dil@@ los grow@@ n@@ up and the laughter against suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most widely published carto@@ on dra@@ fts@@ men , the bulb n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark .
at 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still recording and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laugh , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immig@@ rant in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he was among other things as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greeting cards - which was frustr@@ ated by him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he once said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines all around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
over and over again , the artists were inspired by cities .
big , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo @-@ figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own statements , he is still working on the drawing table , working daily for nearly ten hours .
over cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , T @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches still find his funny characters widespread worldwide .
for six years he has also been working on a carto@@ on and a TV series with his characters .
the protagon@@ ist in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los &apos;s most popular animal in his drawings - which has an exchange foot@@ er as a counter @-@ player .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie that is supposed to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what to say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that is why he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced literally .
la@@ ven@@ der in Provence threatened with climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is retro@@ grade due to the conditions reminiscent of d@@ rought and because of the diseases borne insects , which causes scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great headache .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert in the C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small zi@@ cade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ das , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is much on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
so we have fewer parts with e@@ there@@ al oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and slow@@ ing evap@@ oration from the soil , but also spra@@ ying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to d@@ rought .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ in@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1200 years anniversary this year .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist emphasizes the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly paper Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists are discussing what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office , which in 2009 was the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them at home .
security experts wrote three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to name names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and abdominal pain are enough .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest from violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses are pil@@ ed up throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are facing attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven states this year .
among the latter is her editor and her inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep though his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; hangs on the façade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the 1930 &apos;s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared topics , the trauma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special Federal Prosecutor &apos;s Office was established in 2010 in order to deal with the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders involved in drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , the kill@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ con@@ sol@@ ete and although the terrain is now more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we are suspi@@ cious of them all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper &quot; Ri@@ odo@@ ce &quot; in the state capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter went away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ours tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but there is practically nothing but silence about Val@@ dez .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in January and the surrender to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the country &apos;s bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields , as rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a one or more people can be shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug king@@ fish@@ ers larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first , in February , there was the publication of a interview with Damascus Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the children , probably gang@@ sters purchased each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to not force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security following the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper publishing the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
in 2003 , he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este when he joined five colleagues to establish the company and sold 50 US dollars of shar@@ ehol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper has earned a reputation because of the bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
repor@@ ters loved to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting examinations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for her coverage in Latin America eight years after the founding of the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history wherever it was leading .
he volunte@@ ered that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task that turns you into a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ my . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ od@@ os@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird that could flood like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office and always sit there at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was his love for routine destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced her to question her own ass@@ umptions about how to best do her work and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their cover@@ t run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells false , keep away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Fe@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be fo@@ ol@@ ed ... and then the thing happens to J@@ avier &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the space in which the employees of Fe@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones suddenly were allowed . days before it became known that sp@@ y@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size quarter of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers who the governor themselves did not consider trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the repor@@ ters went to the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are actually under control .
for the issue of this week , Fe@@ odo@@ ce has hit three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former well @-@ known speaker , Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to the state expendi@@ tures concentrated on the governor &apos;s hom@@ etown .
and there was a group that led to a kidn@@ apping in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor .
there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the reig@@ ning Institu@@ tional Revolutionary Party ( PR@@ I ) which dominated all the political levels almost the whole century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this locality , including one in which a son of &quot; El Ch@@ apo &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped from a military raid .
just a few months earlier , readers would have viewed the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had already known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body shape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists because employees have become something they themselves never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez gra@@ b@@ bed a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning due to another journalist to the Office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is theirs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the whole country journalists have become lou@@ der by writing in organized protests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on foot@@ paths and buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the Val@@ dez district .
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of scor@@ ing journalists and bringing them to death because they told the truth .
she has asked since then that she is again divided by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by organised crime , government officials involved and an in@@ different society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on command of politicians and security forces infected with organised crime under a blanket .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the past year , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ um 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; media group has assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because you want you to keep your mouth shut , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found together with a note supposedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones are beside her separate head .
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z openly addressed the cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben E@@ spin@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fle@@ eing from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug traffi@@ cking sc@@ ares him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk before the office and d@@ rank beer when all their phones started hum@@ ming .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with ri@@ vals and security forces near the resort of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the ker@@ b edge they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens how@@ led nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez over@@ threw the polic@@ emen who kept guard to see if they were ready .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you keep thinking about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day when J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used clo@@ ak to ev@@ ade his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a frigh@@ tening one .
researchers have now found out that the first findings of the unbelievable r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros of a Canadian mountain worker have been preserved so well that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described it as &quot; the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , who lived in the middle of the county time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has ast@@ o@@ unded researchers that describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine on March 21 , 2011 near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he hit something out of the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to expose the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy earth cl@@ umping .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you only b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe it slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , even though it is covered with a arm@@ or and resem@@ ble a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter @-@ sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would allow it to better interfere with its surroundings and ev@@ ade its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours in order to uncover it carefully .
the astonishing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the sh@@ ad@@ owing , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the head of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds the animals living today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was ch@@ ased by enough pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ sier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es must have been &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to study the animal on indications of his life , including his preserv@@ ated intestinal content , to find out what it did as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r when he died fell into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the se@@ abed .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as Süd@@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much far@@ ther inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ sier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but remains preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early chal@@ k time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only gam@@ ble a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot;
the time of chal@@ k was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , which were on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was ch@@ ased by some of his frigh@@ tening ancestors .
to this end belongs the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine on March 21 , 2011 near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the bi@@ ost@@ ly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that prot@@ ru@@ ded from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were washed by Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the din@@ osau@@ r &apos;s underwater equipment kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the skin @-@ keys still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as winning the Lotto .
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ our plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upward .
I can count the scales on its sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , kilometers @-@ long jams - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) some 20 people were injured during a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon .
after the first data of the police , around 17.00 between the junction locations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) were almost 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks .
at first there were no information about the exact number of injured persons .
it was light to moderate injuries , said a police officer .
a great deal of emergency vehicles was at the scene of the accident .
the A8 was completely closed towards Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a ten @-@ kilometre @-@ long back @-@ traffic was formed .
as an A@@ Z repor@@ ter reports , it also came on the tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tory to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle operators who have now reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is sitting on the train and sleeping .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ a .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes an unpleasant or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the trouble @-@ free ticket inspection .
you simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and thus vali@@ date the ticket .
currently , a test run runs on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer goes , we will expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will likely be available at many other remote traffic routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a train speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the train de@@ valuation without conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use them , however , some requirements have to be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - which already most passengers do .
you also have to buy it through the App of the train , the DB navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway .
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : you get into the train , call his ticket in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for the electronic de@@ valuation appears with the test customers .
the train companions get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and took the booked seat Y .
when the train driver arrives at the ticket control at the Y place , he knows that a passenger is sitting with an already de@@ valu@@ ated online ticket .
so one can continue to sleep , continue working , keep quiet .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers .
&quot; who wants to travel relaxed without a ticket inspection by our train atten@@ dant , simply checks in the DB navig@@ ator itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this enables passengers to make their journey time in the train more personalised , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB &apos;s Marketing Director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are one of the biggest stum@@ bling blocks .
because often you don &apos;t have all the documents you need to de@@ valuation online tickets in any case .
either the credit card or the ID card or any other document you have to prove is missing .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling your own tickets and takes the conductor at the end time to take care of other matters .
only a small number of test customers can still use the new service .
and also only on the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not yet available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sh@@ attered to her core .
just one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post from someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child and it &apos;s still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody else posted information on their feed , they closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to we@@ ave the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body , which was stretched out on the street and remained there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought .
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she put her cell phone off to return to twe@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive later in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people who cried , and of a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father wearing a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed , where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators wearing a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ano@@ ther polic@@ eman told his ri@@ f@@ le and scre@@ amed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment , I felt shi@@ vers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 11@@ am she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened during the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in movie the@@ aters since 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who carried a flower @-@ dress and a matching crown , the two discussed a conversation that they had &quot; over the black experience and the black condition countless times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take it away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed , not just activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to liber@@ ate ourselves .
even if I have the chance to give her an experience with which she personally does not experience bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women @-@ child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would have a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the potential non @-@ prosecution of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter have joined with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared the bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has totally changed after 9 August , &quot; she said , and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association , focusing on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fer@@ rel@@ l asked a question : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by inn@@ um@@ erable cases of people , often of wh@@ ites , in a community that benefited from their pain and resili@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people born and grown up in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on didn &apos;t center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ convic@@ t in@@ mates .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks or speaks to us . we speak , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me how these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understand that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and the human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ferr@@ is &apos;s story also repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin have marked the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must carry the main burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held up by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who vibr@@ ated this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no coincidence , although it was at the forefront because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black gay woman stands so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the message cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the ra@@ cial connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years due to the block@@ age of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though it has not been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been spl@@ itting the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the topic hardly leaves one cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as they say one to the bit gallery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s really great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no human needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Si@@ del@@ usion ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while supporters build that a gallery will attract more customers to the city , of which the other businesses profit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery will be planned precisely on the grounds on which the farmer &apos;s market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
with the beginning of the construction work will be concluded .
the Gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with the opportunity to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Zimmer : &quot; we have been shopping in the Far@@ mers Market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes made by the local women very happy again and again .
we also discovered the but@@ ch@@ ery for us .
we would like to wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , too .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall is located in the gallery will depend on the amount of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping ar@@ ca@@ des in Bit@@ burg ?
whether it &apos;s clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets , I don &apos;t think it &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are enough of them in our city .
you can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is inexpensive at the top .
as you can see , stores in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies , because the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , special shops are almost no longer available and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fang : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the peasant market stand during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit of the bit is actually coming .
or does the spec@@ ter bit gallery already manage to distribute all the stores from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it just won &apos;t work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and no one needs a shopping center that stands empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant market hall , thanks to the ma@@ dness of many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess building projects in Bit@@ burg no more place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once the peasant market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible , hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Haar@@ etz , who were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth &apos;s prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison term after making public diplomatic reports about Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming St@@ ay lance ( a matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united their expertise in technology , computer science and art , and man@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and ground@@ breaking dispens@@ er whose condem@@ nation was turned by Barack Obama when he only had three days in his office .
through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted by man@@ ing and from the 30 portraits , how anyone can look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , al@@ beit a bit intellectual commentary is created not only in the form of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison , her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ ined , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with whom she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came just from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ ts and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from waste in order to produce a picture of how these people could look .
that was the time she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she couldn &apos;t be visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her det@@ ained m@@ use were un@@ equal to those who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili &apos;s Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the president would transform Chelsea &apos;s judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person .
that Obama actually only a few days after the book was published , that Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years would require a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome sort of happy encounter .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong , since Donald Tr@@ ump is leading a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government and against Trans@@ gender troops in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to keep away the rigid spl@@ its that it should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is marked with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - an exchange converter from Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pedia of the artist ) , as aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will hopefully bring along is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so that &apos;s 30 of these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is one of the above Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ els mentioned above .
she shows Mann@@ ing as she appears with a hands @-@ free phone in the hands of U.S. disciplinary bar@@ racks , such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they give up your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the show personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations that rally like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at the University of Oxford sought for murder
a nationwide campaign is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an Oxford University employee who will be considered susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago .
on Monday W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of the Cook County Court of Local Court .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died , 26 , after several stit@@ ches .
a common warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials got a call , arrived at Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead on the scene , and det@@ ectives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
since 2007 she is Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ bage , vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that it was now in absence and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case examined by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co @-@ operates in this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a speaker from the University and the Somer@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be present .
chief Communications Officer of the Police Department of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said he insist@@ ently urged the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious hint that said something had happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene very cru@@ el@@ ly .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that it was ra@@ them and war@@ ts in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team at Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : &quot; the police is currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and expl@@ ores a variety of motifs , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in co @-@ operation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA &apos;s schedule to comply with the code that describes the criteria for rein@@ stating R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the Organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he has nothing to worry about for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged state sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has acknowledged a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programmes , and we won &apos;t admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ kos &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission .
in conversation with Russian sales point r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
nobody has to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 as part of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal of WA@@ DA by the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the Moscow headquarters in July , WA@@ DA Director General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your business do not become the next cal@@ ender
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys didn &apos;t work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has called people from outside for help .
a new breed of the Human Resources start @-@ ups is at the wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee &apos;s commitment , it enables companies to address surveys , offer specialist groups and demographic groups , to deal with employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to circum@@ vent the C Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit to track your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it provides a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most discomfort and which managers have low cons@@ ulation results - so that you can drill away why .
companies come to see that at the forefront of job culture , you don &apos;t have to be the next person involved in sc@@ and@@ als , since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nu@@ is@@ ances where those who have spoken were punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance sector could be worth more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the finance technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ k@@ re@@ dit .
cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
like G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent lets you send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , gather confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that enables employees to report bad behavior .
and when the main managing director is involved , complaints go directly to the supervisory board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and law@@ suits , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
in the past , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and in@@ convenient experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good way to persec@@ ute the complaints from staff .
now that the company utilizes Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that have previously been hidden by managers in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practice - can be identified and addressed more quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders against employment legal disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 after Arthur Ander@@ sen &apos;s accounting firm collap@@ sed due to ethical sho@@ cks due to the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the consent of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
in February , Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding from companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only applications .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ ten when their portfolio companies are running well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to enhance commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , it can grow dis@@ appointments and demo@@ tiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask about 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies who have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow staff , ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you worry about that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys has been able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem relates to G@@ lin@@ t , so salvation .
and after gathering feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication , able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
with Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always provides new insights into employees and hopes that in the long term , this leads to a better binding of employees in an industry that is known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose business .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers conver@@ se on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have taken off their tri@@ cot @-@ tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these in@@ active minutes are a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the water@@ man football center next morning at 6 : 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday was Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Brotherhood moved the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as carried out practical exercises during Mor@@ as &apos;s six seasons .
20 minutes before the start of the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supports the regulation of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the many busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on her for three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they went on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
U@@ C@@ LA will end its practice once the camp is over , as soon as the camp is finished , considering the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already been e@@ vic@@ ted with foot@@ balls , which is a protected net behind a door@@ post , which will not be an easy task .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far from thinking that people are renting a room there and then hire them to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counter@@ f@@ eit detection to third parties and then show their results under the original article , the world &apos;s largest online social network said on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect potential false reports and send them to the fact inspec@@ tors who may display results of the fact review from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced U.S. presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being floo@@ ded in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May with false stories , and Germany supports a plan to be punished after social media networks if they fail to quickly remove hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook announced in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts test was launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to finding out which stories are challenged by third parties , people want more context in order to make informed decisions about what they are reading and sharing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that Facebook continues to test its feature of the &quot; related article &quot; and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages .

&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ y May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book by Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only re@@ acted to the stamp of thumb on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his stamp of thumb ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself is there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is beaten so with old papers , that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome note &quot; ) , this seems too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , watching archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the assembled hy@@ ena pots on the walls and bottles that had lived in tren@@ ches for centuries .
he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and talked with landscape care , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , employees were just beginning to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years when aristoc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps that represent what possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch struggling for the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a rebellion that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; Rho@@ des says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising started in this area and I thought an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it priest who hid the Dar@@ rel@@ l family for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is presented from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be quite a cro@@ ok , always to pay debts and spend money on things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to recru@@ it land@@ lords . &quot;
after the end of his deployment in the castle Rho@@ des is looking for other unique writing experiences
he spent a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ mä@@ ki , the territory of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed from nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ n life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle veiled in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the un@@ v@@ eiling of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honne@@ f started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and the slogan secretly on Thursday until Thursday .
at the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their website which was released yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that many things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are convinced that we as Bad Honne@@ f citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it means further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ encomp@@ assing promise , one that gives the city a unique unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she stands in competition with other local authorities .
the city of Bad Honne@@ f will cost a mid @-@ five @-@ digit amount to its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises in Ankara on retirement and carriage in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as in the past , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the pres@@ idency of the head of government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs were also attending the discussions .
as a result , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in excess .
the government is attracting the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the officers of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were removed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan 169 has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ ile Pre@@ dig@@ al Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as a re@@ pul@@ ler of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 persons who allegedly participated in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating since that week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan was called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely clean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really handle the army ?
at the end of February , the newspaper Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article entitled &quot; Dis@@ comfort in the Military headquarters . &quot;
there are concerns in the general staff because of an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the prohibition for female soldiers , wrote the paper .
the Grand Master with the army and security forces is continuing .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan ordered more 7@@ 3@@ 95 citizens to fire by decree , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were old earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times they put@@ ted their role as guar@@ di@@ ans of the secular state order .
after his victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan sup@@ planted the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform agenda of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is target@@ ing the Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer , who sought asylum after the coup attempt , sought asylum abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts in a few years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if that happens , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
already there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army in the alliance after the pur@@ ges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the Green Card rules
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the Green Card rules , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
he proposes to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by changing the way for citizens from other countries to issue Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media .
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for race car shuttle
over the past few months , the future of the race car park has been fought over and over again - now it is supposed to be quite fast .
before the end of the year , the route on which the tourist railway runs is to be built .
in order to secure the future of the race car in the long run , according to the Ministry of Transport there will be construction works on the track this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this particularly important connection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated St. John &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney General on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the repair of the track was estimated at around € 2.5 million .
of this sum , the country sur@@ passes 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , will be finally agreed , and expi@@ red .
the Ministry and the South Thur@@ in@@ gia train as operator are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said At@@ on@@ ement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the Race @-@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle will be ordered regularly in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is an especially popular rail link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
during the past few months , the course of a pilot plant has been tested to determine whether the route is used by enough people to re @-@ order them in the future .
the route is also very steep in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry
just as you thought it could not be even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the realm of sex robots comes .
yes , in fact .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robo@@ tics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robo@@ tics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; people are making fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the publication of his new report .
modern sex d@@ olls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - consciously human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adjust &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is even more disturbing , as many robots possess the &quot; person@@ ages &quot; that a step@@ per woman would look progressive .
modern sex d@@ olls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there &apos;s the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; personality .
Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that fits your personality as well as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion .
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has her mo@@ ods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired , be fixed on conversation or it can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in a mood &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah , settle one the most .
on his website true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just just another sex toy .
their emergence and increasing refin@@ ement point to something dark and deeper in our culture , towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notices their increasing popularity , they still remain at the edge of consumer culture .
but what tran@@ spir@@ es out of the boundary zones may be very instruc@@ tive with regard to the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is , however , a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots come up in a time where women &apos;s rights are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has ple@@ dged to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most deter@@ rent aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the dev@@ our@@ ing bodies and the st@@ och@@ astic eyes , but how realistic this vision appears .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .
the aim behind these sex robots is to create a physical lik@@ eness to actual women as real@@ istically as technically possible ( even with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots do not represent real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no mediation or background story , nothing that indicates independence or anything that might distur@@ b the imagination of total subj@@ ection .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the pron@@ unciation of 2017 : maid
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of the common sense of man
it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that the US voters have pol@@ arized , also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we are all re@@ port@@ edly demanding to burst our filter bags .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps to bring together families .
I mention this because my cous@@ in , a left @-@ le@@ aning poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Republi@@ cans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone whom she knows , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it comes to mind in a wider context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by dump , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer rep@@ el us .
however , there is an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Republi@@ cans of the right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of ration@@ ality in comparison to its standards .
I find myself today from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact occur as a very mild offen@@ se .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ cans must be only mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our kids to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ led and the animals turn out to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ changing music im@@ parts this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city won &apos;t do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not - but a big round@@ about in northern London .
the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , since here two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 &apos;s can go to it and have all a great time .
if I could have been able to evaluate the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one was asked about it .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars , before I could withdraw my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same plus the option to pay the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required .
the poor woman in the department store was terri@@ bly angry while I tired the experience of submitting her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was hospit@@ alized for the treatment of cuts on his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
on account of murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s Day in 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der that hid herself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us Appe@@ al , which they say is too len@@ i@@ ent .
the Prosec@@ ution said that it was lod@@ ged with the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the acqu@@ itt@@ al could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs the risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the four@@ ths from F@@ hats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the vac@@ ations and the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te greeted parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes , headed by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle that grew up in the chicken yard , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the m@@ lower band led a musical titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ cken Farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and allowed it to hat@@ ch from his chi@@ ckens .
instead of a chicken @-@ k@@ ens a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him fell , and the eagle stretched out his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore .
after that the classes scored three and four in the rehear@@ sal of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young go@@ dd@@ les who wore cylinders to make the bet .
the eagle stands for integration , said school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te .
the young animal is different from the other young ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
its purpose is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ door vessel to feel accepted in his new school .
this was followed by a letter of thank@@ sgiving to the colleagues , former school director Michael Müller , who always le@@ aps into instruc@@ tional p@@ lows and the parents &apos; representatives .
the ch@@ ick time is now over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher explained .
she left her students only very reluc@@ tant after two years of teaching , because it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ door wat@@ chers .
finally , all students heard a song of summer time and holiday season sounded .
great joy broke out among the children .
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , shared the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television .
on the morning of August 1 , a group of illeg@@ ally camped in Si@@ th@@ onia was arrested by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway .
the State Department reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have ag@@ grav@@ ated the control over the free camping and place every one who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es .
the controls will be continued throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do Diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
an overview of the most important questions and answers .
at the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars .
they are expected to improve the emission behaviour of cars from the emission classes Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ ted from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ an from the ACE Car Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the negotiated software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates will only apply to the vehicles that have the Schum@@ an software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) Kraft@@ fahrt ( Bundes@@ amt für Kraft@@ fahrt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) has ordered retro@@ fitting .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler informed me to write any affected person .
if an inspection is due anyway , that will be done within the framework of the inspection .
how long should the conver@@ sions ent@@ ail ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment and political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , voluntary deal@@ er@@ ships do not act voluntarily on the issue of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be more time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
what do drivers who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group do ?
the ACE reveals to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would reti@@ re , so S@@ met@@ anine .
is there now a massive drop in price of Euro 4 cars ?
the ACE feared this .
but in the regions where the ban is threatening .
in rural areas there are so far no losses of value for older diesel .
the ACE reveals to wait with a sale .
drill Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards at the renowned Kennedy Center .
as announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) as well as the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the hon@@ orable people .
awards are presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and join his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the lau@@ re@@ ate Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series therefore already announced that he would refuse to attend the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This pres@@ idency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ve them of the means - and that burdens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will take advantage of the discussion with Tr@@ ump in order to clarify their views .

we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Town Builder , will reti@@ re next year .
the job is already adverti@@ sed - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a master builder for the past 31 years .
and the work still makes him a lot of fun as he communic@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports about varied but challenging tasks waiting for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , it is surprising that no application has so far been fulfilling the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
so - taking notice of the regular periods of notice - should still be time for a famili@@ ar@@ isation .
since Has@@ lach works for the administrative community as a sub@@ contractor , the applicant must present relevant conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they couldn &apos;t fill them any more , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but the clos@@ eness to the city is important to the city and to it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports about a good working climate and good sen@@ timent among the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office some important projects have accumulated , looking back on the field of W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is confident about the construction office and its staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the low @-@ furnace car park are about to be initiated .
the zig@@ z@@ ag bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is being renewed , even the stadium reconstruction is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will be able to book with around 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimates W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
for a city building master there is a lot of room for manoeu@@ vre .
with Has@@ la@@ chs own farm and gar@@ dener can react flexibly to many things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old@@ town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what fits in &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going urban building master emphasizes .
the mayor of the city is responsible for high responsibility anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is the builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs here above my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with support and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker also wants his successor to stay for a long time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate but also for the further design of the city .
if you would like to be buried by Roland W@@ acker , according to the city of Has@@ lach , you should have a completed degree in architecture as a graduate engineer or a bach@@ elor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the areas of building and planning law .
the Municipal Building Department is subject to civil engineering , civil engineering , basic renov@@ ations , administration of urban properties , urban farm with building yard and municipal gardening as well as under construction law authority , including monument protection .
bike thrown on pi@@ pelines : South railway tracks blocked
according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bike on the lines in the area of the Le@@ oben Road ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so heavily damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out from two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them since the night hours .
near the crime scene , a pink sco@@ oter and a bike driver had been observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond the borders of Lus@@ ati@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator would have put himself in great danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the facility , as well as the delay of delay and the costs of rail freight transport , pat@@ rons of railway customers could also come to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , there was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considerable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum to go out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the South Railway Line could be managed without any obstruc@@ tions .
just under ten passenger trains were out on Friday morning , two of them concerned the long distance traffic .
freight trains did not come out , but they were late .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , approx . 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study suggests exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases .
the incur@@ able condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut .
the conduc@@ tive researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells pat@@ rol in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penetrate the body .
cells capable of dis@@ solving inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the equilibrium leads too far towards the inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
experiments have found that a type of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lie@@ us , if the same system is also present in humans .
the post@@ doctoral researcher Dr Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same trunk , which had not been separated , had not .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial atoms of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of mice were sequ@@ enced in DNA and six bacterial species were found in mice with the immune cells , but lacking them in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they did not have an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they obtained the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , the researchers let L. reu@@ ter@@ i grow in a liquid and then carried out small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells that were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 per cent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ ae in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can potentially lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at Manchester United , with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pound of Chelsea signed with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup begins against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed with the holder &apos;s role when people like Paul Pog@@ gi@@ as and Andreas Per@@ eira have mar@@ ched at will .
however , matic was excluded from the pre @-@ prepar@@ atory Asian tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the Premier League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho made his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted another three new commitments , but insist@@ ed that the club already had a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four primary new commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three of four , I want to thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; draws &quot; Dream@@ liner into the sky
the Boeing airline depicted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew off Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be on the radar screens .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new depth for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , S &amp; D prime ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern .
only a fire from the central party , no counter @-@ wind from the League - was the most important wish of the electoral fighter .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has radic@@ ally changed .
since then , the employees of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed regional capitals with increasing horror .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ wind .
there were failures .
one after the other .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows that red @-@ green can simply not go@@ vern reliably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial board Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising faction of a Green MP has thrown the government of prime minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the Parliament elections , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ German Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner called upon El@@ ke T@@ westen most apost@@ ate member of Lower Saxony to return their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return their mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive Officer and the election campaign manager of the Gre@@ ens Editorial Board Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election fighter si@@ ghs when the new job message reaches the party centre on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD minister of the SPD of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without any government majority after the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen combined .
it is the preliminary pinn@@ acle of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD state organizations .
and nobody knows what &apos;s next .
the misery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland @-@ election in March .
a blue eye , not more , the comrades dis@@ qui@@ eted at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
then it became - and indeed everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to w@@ ander , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te beat the party even smoothly .
in the weeks after , the comrades were struggling with difficulty .
then , when they had just plu@@ cked new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit was coming from Hamburg .
and with him came the next blast .
mayor Ola@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD deputy , lost his Nim@@ bus last weekend because he was sitting in El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his town was burning .
and because he made everything wrong in the communication of crisis after that , what you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has already been in criticism for a long time because of the VW Be@@ e Aff@@ air and its role on the supervisory board .
mi@@ ese questionn@@ aires were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because , in recent weeks , Wei@@ l always tried to set accents in the Con@@ federation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin did not remain hidden in Martin Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they let it be granted , as they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party from afar .
now the exact opposite could happen .
at the same time , Wei@@ l is at the bottom of no fault with the party @-@ internal stri@@ fe of the Gre@@ ens @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz is not at all .
at times , comrades , therefore , make an effort to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed toward the Gre@@ ens , and here above all to the back@@ sliding parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ westen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , such as Mrs. T@@ westen combined their own career interests over the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German Editorial Board ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ westen is not elected as a direct candidate because of her person but by the national lea@@ der@@ board of the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens , the Lower Saxony parliamentary de@@ pu@@ ties continue .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago , the voters were clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who is leading the SPD in Lower Saxony into the election of the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clarify the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments to the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding for local nucle@@ us III
those who want to renov@@ ate their homes in the years can soon get support from the country .
on top of that , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives St@@ eg City Development informed urban development on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler gave another review of what happened so far .
since 1991 there have been some re@@ development areas .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two @-@ thirds of the funding amount .
in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , recent renov@@ ations are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is also important to promote interior development and not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , the government pres@@ i@@ dium Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a re@@ development area III .
the sum of funding amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which there are 500@@ ,000 euros from the country , the rest of the municipality &apos;s sentim@@ ents .
how is a san@@ itation zone created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to examine so Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether there is any interest in the planned area .
if necessary , the regional borders could then move again .
the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the Federal State &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program , in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , i.e. per property .
the rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a charter .
the grant period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , the survey would take place only once , within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area , a questionnaire for filling out .
in November or December , the regulations should be carried out as soon as possible so that the renov@@ ations can begin next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then declared that every commun@@ e had to carry out the said pre @-@ examinations .
the aim is to assess the situation of urban development and to decide when it will be restored and to what extent .
there will also be a remedi@@ al note in the land register for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again after feeling and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that the project was a key factor for success for the project .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires posted to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which includes , among other things , the structural condition and the renovation prospects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house@@ keeping and residential &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about size , layout and inhabitants of a residential area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Work@@ sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler also emphas@@ ised that the distribution of subsidies after the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who comes first , first grin@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible to reserve funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photographs of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Area II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets itself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through its Bio@@ Te@@ q company .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory An@@ aes@@ thesi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional cost of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed at home as well as with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ al helicopter to South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military provided to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American architecture programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House , made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the Connec@@ tic@@ ut helicopter was placed next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a Wisconsin fire engine and a Miss@@ issi@@ ppi forklift truck .
the White House &apos;s military bure@@ au demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , the deputy nav@@ al commander of aviation .
the message indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn on July 17th at the South La@@ wn for the event , and so long stayed until the grass was ev@@ acu@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the restriction of the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight .
the original flight crew was in the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the aircraft during the time .
the recordings made available by the TI@@ ME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could viol@@ ate the destination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the command@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it sounds as if you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus for reform of the health reform in progress in the Senate and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are required to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
in February , Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation into the presidential jet ahead of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is delighted with the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often carry out training flights around Washington and South La@@ wn in order to dep@@ ose US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tr@@ ump arrived at the G@@ 20 in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House carried out 58 practice sessions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was the training requirement of the crew for the month , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
helicop@@ ters flew an additional 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers over@@ took the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a Si@@ kor@@ sky speaker said that the company was not involved in setting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget desig@@ nations for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things this week that are made in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
of course it is appropriate to highlight this . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump interven@@ ed with the helicopter when he saw his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before tri@@ cky task
the leader of the second Tennis @-@ League ki@@ cks off at the Table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss ki@@ cks off tomorrow from 11 am in Kiel at the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite five games still flaw@@ less , the leader of the second tennis League has gained the sense of reality .
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay certainly has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially in the post@@ erior position I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V mainly imports from the high North .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to missions in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay , looking at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ ah@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this becomes difficult for us as always . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good dose of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the far north is practically im@@ practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
if the Fren@@ ch@@ man is currently active during the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella League , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec , is one of his first races in this season .
the so far un@@ defeated leader Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo yesterday was the white rus@@ hing An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el .
he should also be in Kiel as well as Bo@@ tic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the Club on the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again move into the team .
is it enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one of the Junior World Ran@@ king in January 2016 , nobody fills the cad@@ re from the trainer starting at Mari@@ us Z@@ ay .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump did not really feel happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress packed a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ ams against the US thrust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft plan is to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors of the domestic O@@ MV are worried that , together with other European companies , have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Eastern Partnership ( Nord Stream 2 ) .
the threat set is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise even the sanctions by executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen what the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is put into focus in the chart of Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which is un@@ veiled by Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over .
the season three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received its first trailer and showed the newest vil@@ la@@ ins of the show .
with the third season DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organization of drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ cart@@ el .
&quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a Fort@@ une 500 Company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) resi@@ des in New York .
in the newly published trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war on drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Sil@@ vest@@ re , Kerry bis@@ on and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ co will start on September 1st .
roll back : the city provides 46 kitchen subsidies
the city again organizes the K@@ ita lunch table .
with fixed contact persons for the children and assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back in the urban nur@@ series .
on September 1 the city of Kre@@ feld will take over food supplies in the urban nur@@ series ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the Department of Youth Services , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking is still being cooked : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and provides fresh boiled water .
in the Kre@@ feld area the city operates 46 day@@ care centers , in 44 the kids get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the last year of kit@@ esur@@ fing , 28@@ 00 children were seated at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children , who are cared for 45 hours of the week , have lunch at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Pom@@ mer@@ anz talks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 2 pm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 Parti@@ al @-@ time workers have a kitchen service from 1 September : they heat the delivered food , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give out the meal , clean out , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; employees are assigned to a k@@ ita , &quot; Pom@@ mer@@ anz says .
the size - there are two groups as well as seven rank units - decide on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital management to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is what it is all about : healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; children should help prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita spaces - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also has the charm that it has shown itself in the cost comparison between own control and foreign assignment for the city as the most economical , it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are set anew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much in weight for around 750 people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting director of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will run in the Council elections in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of the Vice @-@ President and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women &apos;s role cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will be held on 5 April .
the Tali@@ ban have issued threats against a election process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international fighting actions to an advisory role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the elections for the first time will hand over power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women of total registered 3.6 million voters were registered .

men try to ro@@ b 13 @-@ year old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have tried on Thursday to ro@@ b a 13 year old girl .
according to information from the police , the men said the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2.@@ 55 P.@@ M. because they wanted to phone with the girl &apos;s mobile phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request but continued with her friends .
then one of the perpet@@ rators tried to attack the mobile phone and the necklace of the girl , which was mis@@ used .
the duo escaped without prey .
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations are underway .
G@@ MB concern about investments at Mc@@ Vi@@ ews factory in Glasgow
a trade union wants to as@@ certain the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow in the case of managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company has kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which also produces tea bis@@ cuits and rich tea bis@@ cuits in addition to other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ in said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s representative , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s insist@@ ed on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Conc@@ erns that funding for modernis@@ ing production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ MB senior organizer , Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply affected by our members .
generations of families have worked here and the workers are concentr@@ ating heavily on the local community and Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ x@@ it , rising cost of living and chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently requires a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the manager at T@@ oll@@ cross first received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it as we value the ongoing commitment among employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly review our business - and that applies to all of our business units and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility . if our operations change at the site , employees and their union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La League may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave in its persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar after having left an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to redeem its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the record of the world record ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , as the League 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ gi@@ ano returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world &apos;s most paid professional ath@@ lete . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is angry about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans object insi@@ sts that the club always has its best to take care of it since its arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned by the PS@@ G president three years ago before this prospect ?
when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any association who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we &apos;ll be in opposition to them , we &apos;ll contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to make one of our players &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sign up &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter turned and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpet@@ r@@ ator deliberately turned out a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld street in front of the estate number 30 , and thus caused a damage of over 200 Euro in the cover of the vehicle .
police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , telephone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for advice .
the police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
because he had a car in his lane , the driver of a VW Tour@@ an had to do@@ dge and tou@@ red the control plan .
on Thursday evening , the 34 year old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um went to Le@@ ese with his VW at 7.@@ 55 a.m. on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au .
in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ zen@@ au he met a passenger car in his lane , so that he had to do@@ dge right .
the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the control plan .
material damage was created on the car .
the driver of the coming car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident report , it can be good that the Merc@@ ed@@ es@@ driver did not notice the accident at all .
the police are now asking witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the pol@@ lu@@ ter to contact the comm@@ iss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au by phone 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope @-@ Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is what author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann writes .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; stated after publication with the German press agency , he received an ap@@ ology from former Regensburg Bishop and present @-@ day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Bene@@ dict XVI .
it would be very useful to the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false evaluation of processes .
the Vatican newspaper , &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand critici@@ zed that reporting on violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen plant was measured with &quot; double standards . &quot;
regarding the attacks in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future , but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ do@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of nam@@ ing the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of the daily experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ do@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis , too , said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; one would like to go to the church and that &apos;s a bound fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pun@@ ches were a very normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they find it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the mis@@ use cases , often pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger emerged .
it is entirely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote the memory tape &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I must take refuge in Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says hes@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the b@@ ist@@ y Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment lawyer , Ulrich Weber ?
in total 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were victims of assault , 67 dom@@ es sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s .
in the final report , it is said to be Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister helped shape physical and psychological violence in many cases .
especially in the case of high emotional appeal , the punishment for the students could also be fi@@ erc@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to many other def@@ end@@ ants , however , many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even bring positive memories to him despite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , H@@ hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of exercise of violence in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , many students are raising his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became pal@@ p@@ able for the latter if a domain set didn &apos;t bring top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as being a bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it .
he has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or compassion in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
even the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school took place outside of his sphere of influence .
at best , one can reproach it , experience it too late or have not taken first hints seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was perceived by practically all inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger portra@@ ys him as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; popular , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who regularly nour@@ ished the guys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and sweets and was &quot; always conf@@ is@@ cated by children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to rage erup@@ tions .
the fact that he did not only kne@@ el with chairs and cast the key@@ ring on the floor , but also distributed ear @-@ fi@@ gs and pulled too nau@@ ghty boys to the hair or ears , he has already ad@@ ored , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the late 1960s and 1970s , with parents and teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state high school .
compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the terrible sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the primary school , this is certainly Bag@@ at@@ ella .
one wonders whether it has to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Bene@@ dict XVI , that many media just fell on him .
at the Bavarian Pope , many people who have never understood it are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is : the report disc@@ usses Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media , a lot has been reported in the context of the report ab@@ uses in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger put in the final report any involvement or involvement with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have entrusted the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an aff@@ ection@@ ate representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the education of sexual abuse was , however , that most victims are silent .
if they did not even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , it was certainly not a ch@@ oral director who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do we rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a girl in question formulated it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely re@@ ali@@ zations and could have stopped the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
I consider it ... even for really absurd to assume that it is bil@@ ing@@ ual or clearer , or rather opened to him than to their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , teachers of trust , etc .
that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment affected him in advance could not be confirmed within the framework of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to talk about any co @-@ workers .
neither can he be accused of hin@@ dering or dis@@ cour@@ aging him .
therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these vile crimes , as happened unfortunately in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the previous Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : it &apos;s the big problem that everything was mixed and mixed in the coverage of a giant mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is exactly the mis@@ use of the report .
it is separated clean@@ ly : between the pre @-@ school and the secondary school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and exc@@ esses as well as , we say , other alleg@@ ations .
the report also deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the cathedral @-@ cats .
the whole hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous examination pedago@@ gy , the cases in which the l@@ ads of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were properly har@@ assed and degra@@ ded , were all born at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions had to prevail .
but with them Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger didn &apos;t have anything to do , because he only got the boys to face when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ ic gymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on this , as most witnesses emphasize , the subject of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; primary school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is tab@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heavenly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different from the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ ic gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was already discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him despite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , at the most , the accus@@ ation remains to have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time 1970 / 71 , when he had just begun to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not active and responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ ic Gramm@@ ar School , which the report even re@@ produces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the pr@@ ero@@ g@@ ative penalty will continue to be practiced in the primary school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as pun@@ ish@@ ments were also banned in Bavaria long ago .
before that , they took place in a legal grey zone , as each one of us probably knows .
it was difficult for him to guess where the people affected might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where the permissible limit was really exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the test penalty for schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis affir@@ med that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to the time at that time .
how do you see it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; histori@@ ans speak of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sn@@ are of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; meaning the danger of judging the past according to present @-@ day moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess is right .
but , of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was det@@ est@@ able at all times and not for what has been bre@@ ached in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that time .
that &apos;s all aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it is finally being worked up .
but at the same time I must take refuge in Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , so to attract ear fi@@ gs and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , he also kept strictly adher@@ ing to it .
what image of his Regensburg time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger given in the conversations with you for the book &quot; My brother the Pope &quot; ?
did the subject test sentence also come to language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , from his perspective , the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen just played a minor role .
nevertheless , I did not at all hide that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without claiming un@@ condi@@ tionally , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and sweets on your own , you don &apos;t even make a great singer and stand before any success from rebel@@ li@@ ous boys , no matter what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people have you experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the conversations with her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I really got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger quite well and experienced again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , fundamental , deeply believing and heart @-@ good people , of which one can &apos;t imagine that he could only do something for a fly .
I get regularly with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his exp@@ atri@@ ation , regularly visit him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him to this day , that he was strictly speaking to them today , are clearly in the minority .
today , most spar@@ rows are grateful to him for enrich@@ ing their lives and bringing them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , of course , that likes - but also a lovely respect person , to which they still look up and worship them .
and please , again quite plain@@ ly : all that you acc@@ use to him are educational methods that were then on the order of the day .
we can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .
but it is extremely un@@ just , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that is behind it , only too obvious .
for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him .
now the state of affairs , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who had acquired great mer@@ its and without him outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany , would probably know no one the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
