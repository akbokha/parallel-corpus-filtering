<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution, where young people are supposed to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pits chapel, where it is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the former ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card in Munich supports exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this, which had to be exciting because the Navi Navi instead of a bypass road showed a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but very informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a Flickenteppich, which one recognizes as such not immediately.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large picture postcard, more detailed maps were used for cities and municipalities, so-called archers.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were written according to the Bavarian Measurement Department between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops departed with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, there were today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map.</seg>
<seg id="18">Elector Max IV Joseph furthered the project, founded the "Topographical Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Measurement Department.</seg>
<seg id="19">The submission form for Munich dates back to 1856 and is to be found like any other on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of Early / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was convened 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877, as a district of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstrasse, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today's Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller-part card appears with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered pieces from the so-called "primeval" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots of land do not occupy more farmers there today - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow - and not a concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the area of the current district au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street names "at the Gasteig" or from the height "Auf der Ventilation" - but also in big letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, one once locked up people with insanity.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich district Irrenanstalt" "" "Auf der Auer Lüft" "" "was created." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended up ending the betting of so-called Irish." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He also prohibited the personnel from using violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first place, later it was expanded to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisrenanstalt in Haar in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Munich Salesianum meet at the site of the former Auer institution.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">To the west lies the football field of the TSV Munich east, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built - in architectural resemblance to the original construction of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "main square" "" "around 1856; the Kaufingerstraße was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allied bombs shelled many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A large remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn circle is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizens rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Farthers has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is to come into force until 28 August 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to bring special attention while travelling through the state and to be cautious as a number of questionable racial-based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here," "" "stated in the statement of the group." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed law of Missouri, which makes it difficult for people to gain discrimination, as well as the state law enforcement agencies which disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the warning, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents like racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more gasoline during the trip and was taken into custody by the Missouri police, without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that black motorists in the state are halted 75 percent more often than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be willing to bring a deposit money or let relatives know they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI report of hate crime that classify the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company due to housing or employment discrimination." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, following the adoption of immigration laws that will oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for migrating violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling in view of the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have implemented the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher crossover project is a successful project and will be continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU members Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have provided an image on-site.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU stand together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met at the court yard of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his operation, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many kittens supplies and houses in five apartments Feriengäste.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest" "" "is for him the alternative marketing way for the milk of his cows, such as Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">Only Regionales come to the table of the Feriengaeste.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is the president of the fisherman's" "" "BLHV" "", "he described the electric fence project as" "" "elementary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "I cannot generate profitable growth on such steep areas." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area provides a lot of work and a lot of work needs to be handled with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the parental farm and cultivated it without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if it does not lead bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the municipality has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leaders." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers should be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the areas could be taken out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how to continue their operations," "" "said the Mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers often stand in criticism because of their funding</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The area of conservation is therefore 40 hectares, which cannot be afforested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was promoted via leader, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometres of willows.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and women's women it's not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">Peter Weiß asserted that "best food is produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Straight Line (LPR) Baden-Wuerttemberg permits state fostering of fencers.</seg>
<seg id="92">The objective is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The requirement is the presence of a flow backdrop marked by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the fencing area must not be towed (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">At the moment the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway for the Fischbacher crossover project 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open-air area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump holds the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate this as well as any other - hence the most carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN about the president's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty-imitators would have lynched him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it touched its meaning, and in particular the meaning attributed to it, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta complained, "I don't want to go down to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factually correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about contemporary resonance to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weeds, your poor, and your oppressed masses who desire to breathe freely, and the elemental rubbish of your rich shores."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "miserable waste" on our screens was better to see.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trumps USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict about the significance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus and her friends, who used to place their words after their death at the base, knew very well that they executed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical representation.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the Exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection between poem and image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, people wanted to change it from the right wing for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anybody, but rather an early neo-conservative, bringing the American flame to the reunited world: "Lady Liberty moves forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not light the way into the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is entirely a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The big imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often horrible cruises on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue refers to them the words of hope and the welcome that they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not illuminate the path, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several Scottish athletes are medals candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m stretch, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team to captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is rather modest.</seg>

<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance runner Muir leads on this road and last year has set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.</seg>

<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers hit him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He knocked at the critic, for sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "because in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we are led like sheep to battle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">"" "" "" "Hogans staff have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page." ""</seg>
<seg id="168">And that is why the American Civil Liberties Union sued him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with "Na," and?. "</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's only Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type as Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his State and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary tool to connect with his voters and to defile his hair-loose head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, blocking of persons coming to the governor's side - which is a public forum that is designated as official and paid by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hulfilled people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I said politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crime and other current news," she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject, then some people are rather disregarded as a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the governor's employees called as" "" "concentrated spam" "" "would probably call" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times, if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical cortical articles and to arrest and silence the demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>

<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>

<seg id="423">In addition to the ever-triumphant sales figures and even more gigantic sales figures, Tesla boss Elon Musk has revealed a different, less glittering figure for the first time in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">In recent months, Musk frequently had recruited more than 500,000 orders for the new car, whose extradition is just beginning.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now, Musk admits: from the total of 518,000 reservations, 63.000 times have already been withdrawn.</seg>

<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.</seg>

<seg id="435">Who orders a "Model 3" today, can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 with delivery - when Tesla manages to drive his brand-new, never-tested production lines with maximum utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>

<seg id="440">One day after being deplored by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Authority, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce the emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>

<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment, was a long time a reliable opponent of strict environmental protection regulations.</seg>

<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress push for a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumour celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historical St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors Tumlingens to their request.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergischer Urkundenbuch: count Hermann von Sulz sold the hill with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, on the Tumlinger mountain apart from the former parish church, there was also a magnificent court where the Church or the patron saint belonged, and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people living there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt starting from 1858, next to the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which are still visible in the village scene of Tumlingen, the "Berg" is the third, the beautiful settlement nucleus of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the time around 1600 are proof of these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage was derived from the early medieval right of the Church.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest still remained the owner of this church and could bequeath his own church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to use a pastor or to suggest a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The largest of the two were ceremonially torn down at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell then sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648), the windows were hammered and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and the church stack and used it as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Night, 1834, a storm broke the steeple and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower that still exists today was preserved as a witness to the 750 years old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">"" "today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem take care of the" "" "Schaffhauser Rentmeister" "" "as successors of Dieter Dockhorn." ""</seg>
<seg id="494">As organisers, the friends and supporters of Tumlgens invite for the sixth Serenade to the old cemetery to St. Hilariuskapelle on Sunday 16 July.</seg>
<seg id="495">This will be shaped by the Combo of the Kepler High School Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Hartmut Romann is talking about the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">To the end of the serenade, a drink takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>

<seg id="507">It is unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheim Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, as at that time in Viersen, only at the city border to Schwalmtal there existed a wind power concentration zone.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">"" "such zones should prevent a" "" "pardon" "" "of the landscape." ""</seg>
<seg id="511">Only a few days earlier, the city of Viersen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette by a change of the land use plan - but this was not approved by the Düsseldorf District government due to a form error.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "due to the lack of planning legal requirements, the granted approval certificate is still unlawful and therefore also to be withdrawn," "" "said Mr Erkens, President of" "" "Boisheim" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a new subsidiary of the NEW, is planning to build four wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the town Viersen contributed indirectly, closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the establishment of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - equivalent to about one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four-legged households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen's city councillor gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Windpark Linnich near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="532">In September, Bad Langeneiaer and people from the region will rediscover the shopping facilities in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="533">The commercial club and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th in order to lure the inhabitants to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="534">Like the chairman of the Gewerbeverein, Christian König, announced, the "home-shopping" weekend should sensitise customers, which offers the own city away from the usual supermarket commodity.</seg>
<seg id="535">Accordingly, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.</seg>
<seg id="536">In addition, domestic companies should present themselves with their training places.</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition, the shops of the city center will invite for "midnight shopping."</seg>
<seg id="538">The campaign aims not only for residents of the city and the surrounding region.</seg>
<seg id="539">In preparation were advertising spots on the radio, an internet video and printed bags, which point to the action weekend, so Christian König.</seg>
<seg id="540">City administration and commercial association co-operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</seg>
<seg id="541">This means that the commercial association and the city go to another stage of the project "Attractive Downtown."</seg>
<seg id="542">This includes new offers such as the first "active day" to the Brunnenfest together with sales on Sunday, talks with all professionals and hosts in order to make them active.</seg>
<seg id="543">Also attractive offers on Saturday and the abandonment of parking fees this day are part of the concept.</seg>
<seg id="544">In addition, customer potentials should be newly or re-opened.</seg>
<seg id="545">This includes spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="546">But also many locals would have lost the city center while shopping.</seg>
<seg id="547">In the end everyone would have to contribute to liven the city centre - to landlords, the factories of the whole city and clubs.</seg>
<seg id="548">It was time to overcome the lethargy with a network that was partly widening, King said in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="549">Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities are participating in the nationwide third "home-shopping" day.</seg>

<seg id="896">The method of medical age assessment, X-ray imaging of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.</seg>

<seg id="904">The works on the three bridges of the provincial road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are progressing well.</seg>
<seg id="905">A total of seven tons of heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "we are very well in time, it's going great," "" "says Reinhold Leicht, head of construction at the Department of Traffic and Transport in the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg." ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, the works began at the same time on all three refurbishment-needy bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The end of the building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete coated with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has meanwhile arrived in the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10,60 meters long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning on the northern side received a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons weighted bridge deck.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is an edge fixing system, which is also used as an operating mode.</seg>
<seg id="919">On Friday, a 2.20 metre wide bridge deck is to be used on the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is to get lost.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing is that it is finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special fingerspitzfeeling has required laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable, to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">Prior to the work, the residents were informed about the project by handrails.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building yard and the bushway in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by traffic lights.</seg>
<seg id="928">For the construction work on the bridge at Lauterbach village entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is completely blocked.</seg>
<seg id="929">The cost of the three bridge refurbishments amounts to 700 000 Euros.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the Fiscal Rules of Football affect Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered issues of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the guiding organisation that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious UEFA Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules launched by the UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can surely make money loose for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the wealthy ruler family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but must counter with legitimate income sources which allow them to break even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, which in their quest for success had taken enormous debts, were effectively deceiving and risking to ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011 FFP shifted from concentration on the debt of the clubs to monitoring their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea, bought a club with potential and then invested strongly in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher affair.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year period of FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen from the presidency in 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to be deterred by excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "surely FFP is not dead and we will surely reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for UEFA for FFP, compared with The Associated Press last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the revenue streams for the next five years amounting to EUR 44.4 million can be reported in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of EU FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was lowered to 20 million euros later - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is on the lookout for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a catargic company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered a legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar on payments by the Organizing Committee of the World Cup 2022.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar have denied that Neymar World Championship ambassadors will be promoted and a great manoeuvre for the UEFA regulatory authorities could be easy to figure out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "the previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to ignore any attempt to circumvent rules." ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They talked about the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last financial year must be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and tricot purchases.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signing of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going, and she tried to prevent Neymars going away by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the president of La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's last ownership to PSG.</seg>

<seg id="1159">Chocolate Frey has produced chocolates for Swiss in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the sweet cooperation is in front of a possible end: the airline rewrites the contract anew.</seg>
<seg id="1161">On request of the news agency, Swiss-speaking Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" from Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">According to current planning, the airline will contract a new contract in the first half of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.</seg>

<seg id="1168">But more important is the advertising effect: it is a prestigious order for a manufacturer of shoemakers.</seg>
<seg id="1169">The Swiss does not want to reveal how many candidates do in the new tender.</seg>
<seg id="1170">But only Swiss manufacturers are eligible for this.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to make an effort to renew the contract over the spring of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the sda, the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Swiss Life has been distributing chocolates on board their flights since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.</seg>
<seg id="1175">Swiss Life took the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.</seg>

<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes to "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of the story is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80's, for the 90-years grunge era (as the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch-comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd were going to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as a franchise it feels like the time is scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" was surprisingly good, not only because of his absurd humour (it contained an original story for a talking tin of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By sticking to the core of the bag - middle-aged actors play horny children who will grow up - they nevertheless managed to regain the impossibility to regain the last part of the weather.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adult who now play adults, is less emotional rooted and his parody goes more to the casting-like principle, among them a reef on the Stalker films of the 90's like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."</seg>
<seg id="1190">"" "at one point, a character goes through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and" "" "a number of other things from 1991" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The amiable coop (Mr. Showalter), now a Romanautor, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost its virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy-vicious plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good sung impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the exams are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It's a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons' moustache 'Singles', whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old cracker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">These are the moments of random insanity that could fuel this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until he achieves that which I consider his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the gang how they will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now recalls a different sort of nostalgia: reminiscent of the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," the movie "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-West Ringwar iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici whose dialogues from Channing Tartum (also a full producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synchronised in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice flags to look (the police spend time watching chess on television as Americans might do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Finde the Voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so much involved in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask - that it often plays like a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six long episodes, it is moving away, and the comedy is not fast or frequent.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," which was edited down to a lower length, could better deliver his Agitprop satire, as Gregor and Iosef continuously visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a pile of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make all the food for a banquet.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Live the great life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former bank with a passion for real estate, resigned from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"" "" "" "before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," "" "says Joanne." ""</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I was looking for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add a closet space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"" "" "" "I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light." ""</seg>
<seg id="1327">"" "that was my requirement," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose they commissioned the Architecture and Designstudio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">"" "" "" "Erfan had to think creatively in order to solve the task." ""</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it work for a longer time.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and jars by Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">What is special about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering went there," "" "explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF-door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is counterweight so that when you push the door, it glides very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and conduct a calculation based on the soil size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor surface and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and that will help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love the electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself by good design and increased square footage of some standard to something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide to not leave this.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fighting for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a dispute because of one of the biggest real estate imperial Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business should be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family purchased a business at Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco Jeans family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and the De Lutis portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburb.</seg>
<seg id="1363">"" "after an agreement with her late father Colin - by Paul as" "" "main operator and the dominant personality" "" "is described in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul roughly one third." ""</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin's ownership of $316 million and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the opinions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in 2015 in a first Affidavit." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The Brothers now also fight for control of the existing business, which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to manage some possessions incompetent.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the quarrel.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs increase, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950's and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to purchase the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the family's first jeans.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give her property to her sons graciously.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land at court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>

<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps's new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly really can do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"" "" "" "when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with managerial staff on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House that he wanted to fix: poor information falling into the hands of the president." ""</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "Kelly said to the staff that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys Diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame drump by monitoring their media own.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship with television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "when candidate Trump has been angry for unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were to be persuaded," "" "said former electoral advisor Sam Nunberg in February opposite Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keeping Trumps Twitter" "" "habit was to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that Trumps's Twitter practice was ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know for others - that Trumps tweets would have included even more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees managed to keep him out of trouble for a few times, their efforts were worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has been able to prevent drump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are always trying to present their own agenda by presenting Trump material that perhaps promotes their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - entirely occupied with this story - reported in May about the predilection of advisors to lead the President from strategic reasons doubtful information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "recent and former Trump officials say that Trump, like a volcano, can react to negative press clippings, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he tries to find out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">That was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously accused the president of a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been permanently banished from Twitter for chicane or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and has revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and began asking employees about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "goldsmith added that the then Chief of Staff of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work out?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is made up of the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house at the gates of Freudenstadt will be renovated and will be reopened on March 1st next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">They are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closing of the Hotel Birkenhof by the former Ambiente Company GesmbH on April 13, 2014, approximately 30,000 overnights per year were lost and also income by the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the autumn of 2014, in view of the dramatic increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered to the district office as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a planning plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">At that time, the decision was not undisputed.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadard's Mayor Julian Osswald defends the site and at that time spoke of serious interested parties to the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He was to be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisendas with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house in the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">At the former Hotel Birkenhof have been building breakages before the entrance for some time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors were torn out, ceilings partly broken down, old bathtubs were removed from the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">Until March there is still a lot to do.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the black-and-white style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1465">"" "everything should become" "" "beautiful naturalistic" "" "later, as Thomas Scherer says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1466">"" "" "" "we want to make a piece of jewellery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1467">Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1468">You don't want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but even on a high-level inner city level, Scherer emphasises.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up wide, explains Scherer further.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Both individual vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="1471">He has already led talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, so shavers.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The notions of the city are identical with those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">Thomas Scherer doesn't want to set a precise definition of the amount of investments.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Just under one million euros, he reckons.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The exterior plants are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.</seg>
<seg id="1477">In a courtyard there is a large terrace, which is open to the public by the restaurant, which is open to the public.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: us Special Intermediate sets out Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair headed by US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "in recent weeks, the committee recorded the work, wrote the" "" "Wall Street Journal" "", "referring to people familiar with the subject." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper took the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN broadcasted reported that there were already first charges of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us intelligence services have been accusing the Kremlin for some time now, to be targeted at the 2016 presidential election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of the investigations there are several men who acted as advisers to the republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">As a result, Mueller took a close look at more and more trumps in a private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Observer Trump has personally moved to the centre and forexamining whether the president may have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Juries is to examine this evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether it should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Juries are therefore also called anchoring spammers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">They are mostly turned on when these are larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The process always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor's Office in order to invite persons to the company under Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to CNN, pre-invitations have already been issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Persons involved in the meeting were invited to a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., Trumps counsellor and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former election campaign manager Paul Manafort also attended the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts reported on Thursday evening on US TV that the institution proved that Mueller would not intimidate himself in his work and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end in order to decide on the accusation of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the president used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">The subject gives the democrats a way to "feel good, because they have nothing else they can talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the entry of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But he usually works secretly, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House affords any action that accelerates the work of the" "" "fair" "" "intermediary in a" "" "fair" "" "way." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">Former FBI leader James Comey said three times that not against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">There is no reason to assume that something has changed in this regard, it was called forth in the statement.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this redesign, accusations against Trump became loud, he wanted to impede the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Committing a Senate committee in June, Comey asked him to stop the investigation against the former national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation as to whether Trump Mueller wanted to dismiss.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair around the later retired president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he theoretically could be fired at the presidency of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">But several Senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>

<seg id="1525">In total, however, there have been a series of unusual intercepts of ice eliciled in the region for around 30 years, the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a facsimile background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now aborted colossus was so far a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelice floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It grows further and further into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelslab lies south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this ice shelf, the equilibrium of waxes and breakdowns occurred a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete ice shelf is crumbling there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelslab is in danger, because the front edge has never been as far back as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase sea level, as they float on the water and suppress ice as much water as follows after melting by itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, is the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, Larsen-C-Schelhos is the fourth biggest ice shelf in Antarctica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the crossing from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural phenomenon and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the record," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">"" "among scientists, whether the Larsen-C Schelhos will grow back or go back in the long run and possibly coincide, his colleague Adrian Luckman said:" "" "our models say that it will be less stable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers fail to trace this gigantic iceberg's downfall to climate change, many of the ice-caves of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart during the past few decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long top of Antarctica covers South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the last 50 years and thus counts to the areas in which the temperature is the quickest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants home tariff at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU calls for the employer association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Just before the summer break, the circle-day spent 41 new jobs in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials are working for the administrative district in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 apprentices have their first working day behind them.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships at the circle are obviously very sought-after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were posted for the places to be distributed this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle continues to lack personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present there are still 50 vacant passages in the Mettmann circle.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and UWG, and face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "according to the wishes of the parties, the administration will" "" "develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to meet short-term requirements for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented application shortage.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be oriented to the inside and outside, show concrete measures for lateral entrants and include an education campaign, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is from a regular" "" "contest of public employers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">In addition, there is a high number of employees who are leaving the ministry due to illness or age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">Therefore, it is high time for action so that there are no more places left unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He recently took care of a bad surprise in the circle of the circle when he publicly challenged the costs of personnel costs and the rest of the parties baffled.</seg>

<seg id="1574">In this way, the CDU tries to better pay the employees and officials when it actually envisages collective bargaining for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money is only given if one changes to a higher level which is oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitution law.</seg>

<seg id="1579">Italy sharpens tone on NGO migrants' lifeboats</seg>
<seg id="1580">Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they are not allowed to continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations.</seg>
<seg id="1581">"" "" "" "if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue," "" "said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa." ""</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had confiscated a boat to the German aid organisation 'Youth Rettet', because their team effectively worked together with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed allegations of Ambrogio Cartosio, an Italian prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, saving human life remains our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organization in a statement on social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only judge all accusations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew takes tudinghy migrants on board, which are delivered to them directly by human traffickers, and that smugglers can shut off so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting was allegedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the deed issued by the prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of disposing of the authority of the Italian Coast Guard who oversees the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must first of all have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs that participate in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to stick to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>

<seg id="1598">Nine Weilermer Bikers, the "Berlin Outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Norpfalz region to enjoy trials and sightseeings for four days.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome addition.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led to the Michaelierelle above Deitemheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.</seg>
<seg id="1603">Observation points were followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream plains.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were again and again longer ascents, for the long tribals rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day after Bad Dürkheim we went to Saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.</seg>

<seg id="1615">The first federal liaisons have also identified this, which are increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The start of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and signed two pros for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>

<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven, for example, have qualified.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football, especially with the 14 to 30-year-old, has to deal with the fact that young people are still going to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>

<seg id="1630">But is it really a kind of sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to it.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobber has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sport - e.g. increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, cognitive abilities, technical and tactical comprehension and quick responsiveness are required.</seg>

<seg id="1639">The scientists emphasize the high integrative effect of e-sports.</seg>
<seg id="1640">Players are internationally on the move, it's like a big global family, there are no intercultural obstacles.</seg>

<seg id="1643">In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.</seg>

<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the undertakings as a callback.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of car manufacturers to install exhaust gases excreted from diesel vehicles also increases, making it difficult to keep cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of harassing the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called switch-off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but driving back in normal driving conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1782">"" "" "" "the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," "" "he once said." ""</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert in the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist emphasizes the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly paper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists are discussing what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office, which in 2009 was the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts wrote three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to name names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and abdominal pain are enough.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of standing on the payroll of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest from violence, and while the corpses are piled up throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are facing attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven states this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspiration from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep though his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the 1930's, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special Federal Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 in order to deal with the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders involved in drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolete and although the terrain is now more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefits, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we are suspicious of them all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper "Riodoce" in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "twelfth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter went away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is practically nothing but silence about Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in January and the surrender to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa one or more people can be shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-story mausoleums for drug kingfishers larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February, there was the publication of a interview with Damascus Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the children, probably gangsters purchased each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to not force Valdez to leave the country for his own security following the confiscation of another newspaper publishing the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">In 2003, he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste when he joined five colleagues to establish the company and sold 50 US dollars of shareholdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the drug problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper has earned a reputation because of the bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-fitting examinations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">"" "she received the prestigious" "" "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize" "" "for her coverage in Latin America eight years after the founding of the company." ""</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history wherever it was leading.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>

<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked," "" "What did you do in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodosce team missed Valdez, the fun bird that could flood like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office and always sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Was his love for routine destruction?" ""</seg>

<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells false, keep away from it.</seg>

<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggler routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the space in which the employees of Feodoce met for safety training, no mobile phones suddenly were allowed. days before it became known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-size quarter of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers who the governor themselves did not consider trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are actually under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Feodoce has hit three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former well-known speaker, Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to the state expenditures concentrated on the governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that led to a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the reigning Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) which dominated all the political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped from a military raid.</seg>

<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists because employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning due to another journalist to the Office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"" "in the whole country journalists have become louder by writing in organized protests," "" "SOS Press" "" "on footpaths and buildings." ""</seg>
<seg id="1891">On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the Valdez district.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of scoring journalists and bringing them to death because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has asked since then that she is again divided by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has violated objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are" "" "surrounded" "" "by organised crime, government officials involved and an indifferent society." ""</seg>

<seg id="1926">The report in the journal "Current Biology" described it as "the best-preserved dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier, who lived in the middle of the county time between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His incredibly well-preserved condition has astounded researchers that describe it as "really remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivorous is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>

<seg id="1931">He hit something out of the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to expose the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) of heavy earth clumping.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>

<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivores, even though it is covered with a armor and resemble a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would allow it to better interfere with its surroundings and evade its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours in order to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the shadowing, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the head of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaur was chased by enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution favored the concealment of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the shading - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which signals that this Nodossier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur carnivores must have been" "", "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to study the animal on indications of his life, including his preservated intestinal content, to find out what it did as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur when he died fell into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the seabed.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as Südflorida today, and rivers and oceans are probably much farther inland than they are today.</seg>

<seg id="1955">The time of chalk was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, which were on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was chased by some of his frightening ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">To this end belongs the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumfied in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine on March 21, 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the biostly armored dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that protruded from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were washed by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the dinosaur's underwater equipment kept his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the skin-keys still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as winning the Lotto.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>

<seg id="1974">On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8) some 20 people were injured during a mass arambolage on Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1975">After the first data of the police, around 17.00 between the junction locations Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district Aichach-Friedberg) were almost 30 vehicles, among them probably trucks.</seg>
<seg id="1976">At first there were no information about the exact number of injured persons.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It was light to moderate injuries, said a police officer.</seg>

<seg id="1999">To be able to use them, however, some requirements have to be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to have booked an online ticket - which already most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">You also have to buy it through the App of the train, the DB navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway.</seg>

<seg id="2005">The train companions get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and took the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">When the train driver arrives at the ticket control at the Y place, he knows that a passenger is sitting with an already devaluated online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So one can continue to sleep, continue working, keep quiet.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"who wants to travel relaxed without a ticket inspection by our train attendant, simply checks in the DB navigator itself.</seg>

<seg id="2012">Those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are one of the biggest stumbling blocks.</seg>

<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the ID card or any other document you have to prove is missing.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling your own tickets and takes the conductor at the end time to take care of other matters.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And also only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2053">They prepared the bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>

<seg id="2060">Ferrell asked a question: "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>

<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "" "we heard that people born and grown up in Ferguson didn't center their voices and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2072">"" "two of the three founders of the movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin have marked the film" "" "Blacklive Matter" "" "in social media in 2012, identify themselves as gay." ""</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though it has not been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population in proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>

<seg id="2094">While supporters build that a gallery will attract more customers to the city, of which the other businesses profit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery will be planned precisely on the grounds on which the farmer's market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of the construction work will be concluded.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible, hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haaretz, who were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth's prison, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year prison term after making public diplomatic reports about WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Stay lance (a matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united their expertise in technology, computer science and art, and maning, a transwoman and groundbreaking dispenser whose condemnation was turned by Barack Obama when he only had three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by maning and from the 30 portraits, how anyone can look with these genomic data, a sharp, albeit a bit intellectual commentary is created not only in the form of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison, her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grained, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with whom she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came just from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting DNA from waste in order to produce a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she couldn't be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her detained muse were unequal to those who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic "Suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili's Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president would transform Chelsea's judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually only a few days after the book was published, that Manning's release after seven brutal years would require a military prison in Kansas was a welcome sort of happy encounter.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong, since Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government and against Transgender troops in order to find new, tweetable ways to keep away the rigid splits that it should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is marked with a heart) an end of "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation gender, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - an exchange converter from Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), as astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people will hopefully bring along is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of these stories." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - deceitful.</seg>

<seg id="2209">A new breed of the Human Resources start-ups is at the waxing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee's commitment, it enables companies to address surveys, offer specialist groups and demographic groups, to deal with employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to circumvent the C Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit to track your health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it provides a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most discomfort and which managers have low consulation results - so that you can drill away why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the forefront of job culture, you don't have to be the next person involved in scandals, since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nuisances where those who have spoken were punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as Glint, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>

<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber-Falles in Miskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Cent has nearly 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like Glint, Convercent lets you send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, gather confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that enables employees to report bad behavior.</seg>

<seg id="2224">If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and lawsuits, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and inconvenient experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to persecute the complaints from staff.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company utilizes Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden by managers in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practice - can be identified and addressed more quickly.</seg>

<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the consent of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only applications.</seg>

<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to enhance commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change is not fast enough, or not at all, it can grow disappointments and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"" "" "" "if you ask about 4,000 suggestions, you must be prepared to have 4,000 talks," "" "said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies who have relied too much on collecting data." ""</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it could not be even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the realm of sex robots comes.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, in fact.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people are making fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - consciously human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can" "" "adjust" "" "his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it is even more disturbing, as many robots possess the "personages" that a stepper woman would look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there's the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Roxxxy Gold has a personality that fits your personality as well as possible, "enthuses the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "it can be tired, be fixed on conversation or it can" "" "be in a mood" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step on Frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah, settle one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website true Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxxy?" is it on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing refinement point to something dark and deeper in our culture, towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notices their increasing popularity, they still remain at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what transpires out of the boundary zones may be very instructive with regard to the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is, however, a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots come up in a time where women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has pledged to have women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most deterrent aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the devouring bodies and the stochastic eyes, but how realistic this vision appears.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to create a physical likeness to actual women as realistically as technically possible (even with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, brought to the point when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots do not represent real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background story, nothing that indicates independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of total subjection.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the pronunciation of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of the common sense of man</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that the US voters have polarized, also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all reportedly demanding to burst our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everyone whom she knows, including the republican relationship with which she fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it comes to mind in a wider context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by dump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his kittens will no longer repel us.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing are "normalized," which suddenly appear as the epitome of rationality in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to Trump in fact occur as a very mild offense.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be only mentally healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York Park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurled and the animals turn out to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-changing music imparts this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city won't do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in northern London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park carousel is still a strange magic experience, since here two two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40's can go to it and have all a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have been able to evaluate the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one was asked about it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars, before I could withdraw my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it's the same plus the option to pay the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was terribly angry while I tired the experience of submitting her my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was hospitalized for the treatment of cuts on his wrists, according to the prison authorities, according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">On account of murder, Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence after an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder that hid herself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appeal, which they say is too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The Prosecution said that it was lodged with the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the acquittal could be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>

<seg id="2465">Farmer Arnold found a strange egg and allowed it to hatch from his chickens.</seg>
<seg id="2466">Instead of a chicken-kens a small eagle came out.</seg>
<seg id="2467">But the hope of making a chicken out of him fell, and the eagle stretched out his wings on a high mountain, and swore.</seg>
<seg id="2468">After that the classes scored three and four in the rehearsal of Yvonne Frank a chicken dance.</seg>
<seg id="2469">The hens danced with the young goddles who wore cylinders to make the bet.</seg>
<seg id="2470">The eagle stands for integration, said school director Angelika Sitte.</seg>
<seg id="2471">The young animal is different from the other young (chicks), but belongs to it.</seg>
<seg id="2472">But he will never be like a chicken.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Its purpose is to be free.</seg>
<seg id="2474">She wished every four-door vessel to feel accepted in his new school.</seg>
<seg id="2475">This was followed by a letter of thanksgiving to the colleagues, former school director Michael Müller, who always leaps into instructional plows and the parents' representatives.</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs Town Builder, will retire next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The job is already advertised - but suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been a master builder for the past 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him a lot of fun as he communicates in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports about varied but challenging tasks waiting for his successors.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it is surprising that no application has so far been fulfilling the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">So - taking notice of the regular periods of notice - should still be time for a familiarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach works for the administrative community as a subcontractor, the applicant must present relevant conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If they couldn't fill them any more, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the closeness to the city is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports about a good working climate and good sentiment among the authorities and citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2552">"all in all, great tasks await my successor.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">For a city building master there is a lot of room for manoeuvre.</seg>

<seg id="2556">"" "" "" "you can move a lot," "" "says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors." ""</seg>
<seg id="2557">As the oldtown stands as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the outgoing urban building master emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="2558">The mayor of the city is responsible for high responsibility anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2559">"" "he is the builder," "" "in the end everything runs here above my table." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2560">With support and coordination, he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been working for 15 years.</seg>

<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good working climate but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">If you would like to be buried by Roland Wacker, according to the city of Haslach, you should have a completed degree in architecture as a graduate engineer or a bachelor's degree in architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the areas of building and planning law.</seg>

<seg id="2568">The investigators go out from two male offenders and have been searching for them since the night hours.</seg>

<seg id="2575">Just under ten passenger trains were out on Friday morning, two of them concerned the long distance traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2576">Freight trains did not come out, but they were late.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study suggests exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The conductive researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of dissolving inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium leads too far towards the inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a specific bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system is also present in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same trunk, which had not been separated, had not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbial atoms of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of mice were sequenced in DNA and six bacterial species were found in mice with the immune cells, but lacking them in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they did not have an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they obtained the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers let L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then carried out small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells that were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as an idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 per cent, but if the tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether the tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophanae in the presence of L. reuteri can potentially lead to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2672">Those who want to renovate their homes in the years can soon get support from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">On top of that, mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives Steg City Development informed urban development on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave another review of what happened so far.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991 there have been some redevelopment areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two-thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, recent renovations are a "successful project" - it is also important to promote interior development and not only to open up new areas of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, the government presidium Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a redevelopment area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The sum of funding amounts to 833 333 euros, of which there are 500,000 euros from the country, the rest of the municipality's sentiments.</seg>

<seg id="2688">The measures would be carried out object-related, i.e. per property.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a charter.</seg>

<seg id="2692">In November or December, the regulations should be carried out as soon as possible so that the renovations can begin next year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann then declared that every commune had to carry out the said pre-examinations.</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was at the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American architecture programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House, made a tour of products from all 50 countries.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The Connecticut helicopter was placed next to a yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin fire engine and a Mississippi forklift truck.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House's military bureau demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superiors, the deputy naval commander of aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The message indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17th at the South Lawn for the event, and so long stayed until the grass was evacuated between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the restriction of the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original flight crew was in the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the aircraft during the time.</seg>
<seg id="2724">The recordings made available by the TIME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal employees to use state property for political purposes.</seg>

<seg id="2742">A Sikorsky speaker said that the company was not involved in setting the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMX-1 does not maintain budget designations for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">According to the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per hour.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>

<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not leave in its persecution of Neymar after having left an offer of £189 million to redeem its release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years before the record of the world record?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer, as the League 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, whereby Paul Poggiano returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After finishing, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world's most paid professional athlete. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalans object insists that the club always has its best to take care of it since its arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned by the PSG president three years ago before this prospect?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any association who wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"" "" "" "I'm not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players, we'll be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," "" "said Al-Khelaifi." ""</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Report relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the misuse cases relieves Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann writes.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are church," stated after publication with the German press agency, he received an apology from former Regensburg Bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the Domkapellmeister of Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very useful to the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their false evaluation of processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican newspaper, "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand criticized that reporting on violence in the Domspatzen plant was measured with "double standards."</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future, but the author Lucetta Scardoia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of naming the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of the daily experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scardoia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, too, said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "one would like to go to the church and that's a bound fresco."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "punches were a very normal educational tool" "", "" "" "to deal with cheeky children as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They find it unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the misuse cases, often pope-brother Georg Ratzinger emerged.</seg>
<seg id="2901">It is entirely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memory tape "My brother of the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take refuge in Georg Ratzinger," says hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report submitted by the bisty Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer, Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">In total 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were victims of assault, 67 domes sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is said to be Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that Domkapellmeister helped shape physical and psychological violence in many cases.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in the case of high emotional appeal, the punishment for the students could also be fiercer.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "in contrast to many other defendants, however, many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even bring positive memories to him despite violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hhesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of exercise of violence in the Regensburger Domspatzen" "", "gives a contradictory picture of Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">On the one hand, many students are raising his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as choleriker and perfectionist, who became palpable for the latter if a domain set didn't bring top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as being a biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself, why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or compassion in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Even the excesses of violence at the pre-school took place outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best, one can reproach it, experience it too late or have not taken first hints seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the" "" "redemption," "" "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "" "was perceived by practically all interviewees." ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">For example, the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger portrays him as "warm-hearted," "popular," "honest," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher, who regularly nourished the guys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and was "always confiscated by children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to rage eruptions.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only kneel with chairs and cast the keyring on the floor, but also distributed ear-figs and pulled too naughty boys to the hair or ears, he has already adored, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the late 1960s and 1970s, with parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the terrible sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the primary school, this is certainly Bagatella.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it has to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just fell on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian Pope, many people who have never understood it are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report discusses Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, a lot has been reported in the context of the report abuses in the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger put in the final report any involvement or involvement with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "said an affectionate representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the education of sexual abuse was, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, it was certainly not a choral director who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do we rate Ratzinger's Ratzinger's Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a girl in question formulated it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely realizations and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... even for really absurd to assume that it is bilingual or clearer, or rather opened to him than to their parents, dormitory managers, teachers of trust, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "in this way the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that the students and / or their environment affected him in advance could not be confirmed within the framework of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free to talk about any co-workers.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Neither can he be accused of hindering or discouraging him.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these vile crimes, as happened unfortunately in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media there was a lot of" "" "violent excesses" "" "to read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the previous Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking away" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: it's the big problem that everything was mixed and mixed in the coverage of a giant melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is exactly the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">It is separated cleanly: between the pre-school and the secondary school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and excesses as well as, we say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">The report also deals with incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the cathedral-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrendous examination pedagogy, the cases in which the lads of sadistic teachers were properly harassed and degraded, were all born at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions had to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger didn't have anything to do, because he only got the boys to face when they were already on the Domspatzic gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on this, as most witnesses emphasize, the subject of" "" "primary school" "" "is taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even" "" "heavenly" "" "conditions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the Domspatzic gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was already discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims "" "" estimated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him despite violence. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2959">Thus, at the most, the accusation remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time 1970 / 71, when he had just begun to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not active and responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzic Grammar School, which the report even reproduces.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out this," "" "that the prerogative penalty will continue to be practiced in the primary school." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as punishments were also banned in Bavaria long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took place in a legal grey zone, as each one of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to guess where the people affected might be exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit was really exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test penalty for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis affirmed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "historians speak of the" "" "snare of anachronism" "", "meaning the danger of judging the past according to present-day moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But, of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was detestable at all times and not for what has been breached in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all awful and I'm glad that it is finally being worked up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take refuge in Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishing, so to attract ear figs and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, he also kept strictly adhering to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What image of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger given in the conversations with you for the book "My brother the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject test sentence also come to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, the Domspatzen just played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not at all hide that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this has to be said: without this perfectionism, without claiming unconditionally, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and sweets on your own, you don't even make a great singer and stand before any success from rebellious boys, no matter what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced Georg Ratzinger during the conversations with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger quite well and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply believing and heart-good people, of which one can't imagine that he could only do something for a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regularly with how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his expatriation, regularly visit him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him to this day, that he was strictly speaking to them today, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Today, most sparrows are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, of course, that likes - but also a lovely respect person, to which they still look up and worship them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, again quite plainly: all that you accuse to him are educational methods that were then on the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is extremely unjust, a man just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that is behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which was just published, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the state of affairs, a 93-year-old man, who had acquired great merits and without him outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany, would probably know no one the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
