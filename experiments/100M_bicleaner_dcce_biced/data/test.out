a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother claimed that he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went uphill again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss it pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia stated that Frank initially lived in Host@@ els , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star has now made it un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or glued on outside labels that have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are more likely to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as explained in the current Cos@@ mop@@ olitan .
most of the time , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , in front of a TV with a relaxed de@@ bris and Mexican food , in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for white blood , she asks the question of the desire for children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not Child &apos;s Play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us as of August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little change with some colleagues on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes , the horses remembered their evening , they hun@@ ted at the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home to the feeding trou@@ ghs .
one kilometer at this speed , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and so the riding career ended again .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament wins - again near horses .
he was guided with his family about the layout of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even ho@@ ver for photo purposes .
it was the first time in Aachen and therefore also with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German online help handed the man from An@@ hausen in the course of a small gala the golden sports pyramid .
the li@@ ke@@ able ath@@ lete does not have any awards .
Federal Cross of Mer@@ it , Silver Lau@@ rel leaf , Champions tour @-@ player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ailed him .
long is the 18th winner of the Sport pyramid .
in Aachen on Saturday he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger has been supporting the offspring .
and so he continued the € 25,000 prize money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , twice the US master si@@ eger was shot at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the winners include the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gr@@ enger , the fen@@ cer Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the show jum@@ per Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um der Hand@@ ball Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legend came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ field , where the Lav@@ azza &apos;s price was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ed : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade deal T@@ TP - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump want to prevent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two U.S. pres@@ idents are not one of the tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
that , about the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate it , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will mas@@ sively go back to regulation and he is campaig@@ ning for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state has to fulfill certain tasks , it has to open some dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore taxes for the rich would be increased , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
in the meantime , Tr@@ ump and Clinton need to be invested almost verb@@ ally .
the democratic applicant is even announc@@ ing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical wing of the Republi@@ cans .
so on Tr@@ ump there could be party @-@ internal discussions .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA .
oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas , he plans to termin@@ ate the Paris climate protection agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , intends to specifically expand renewable energy with its investment program : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in terms of infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart from each other .
T@@ PP , the transc@@ end@@ ental trade agreement , both do not want to sign .
at the same time , however , both do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but rather to better protect American jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should also be paid better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ ins@@ ed , then he says he must not be changed .
but the great discussion of the coming months is probably more likely to develop the tax policies of the two camps .
on the one hand , Tr@@ ump is standing , which wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth .
his critics claim that the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who at least wants to ask the rich to pay more taxes , and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
escape : &quot; every fle@@ dged woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is almost a part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing themselves .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women are sitting in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby with a maximum of one year old .
one has put her little son in her arm .
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the tab@@ let@@ op .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she s@@ miles briefly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until one talks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social services in Bavaria , and deals with women on the run , among other things .
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentr@@ alized accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs has set up the institution together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
it has recently been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - either not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families send them as hope for Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland they have experienced experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ ours , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run this goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that tu@@ gs demand sexual action for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
whoever believes that as soon as they arrived in Germany , er@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
even here , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and ab@@ used at worst .
this means that approximately 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not volunteer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about what they experienced , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , I need more accommodations just for them , says B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answers with no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in government accommodations .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fle@@ eing women are not separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or own houses in some common shel@@ ters and their own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations only for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also calls for women to be separated from men separately . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the privacy is missing or are men and women put together , it can become - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is available in the study .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read at the urge that it gives to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily open a second house .
Regi@@ stra@@ r general strike : demands for new work @-@ fighting measures
representatives of the assistance physicians have called on their union to appro@@ ve new labour struggle measures in their disputes regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work @-@ fighting measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC stated that ministers would have agreed to address the concerns regarding the contract .
in July , resident doctors and medical students have agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in favour of the elections .
in a letter to the members released on Twitter on Thursday evening , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would have remained &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; to problems , leading to the rejection of the Treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In light of this , the J@@ DC Board agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and request official new negotiations for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today filed a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council in order to appro@@ ve an ongoing program of escal@@ ating activities commen@@ cing at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the fact that resident doctors tou@@ red six times this year , the first total out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS .
the director of the B@@ MA assistant physicians Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ ig@@ ned after the election to reject the agreed terms of contract recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings , which still took place prior to the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assistants and medical students , with the agreement that the contract should be beneficial and should be accepted .
after the vote , the health minister Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and proclaim an official end to the eight @-@ month @-@ long war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish back @-@ player in the gold @-@ gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be very dirty and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report a whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but can even improve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next day , a newspaper said that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if there had never been anything bad .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s g@@ lowing , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had not forgotten anything .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory remarks : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at that time was angry .
Putin announced and acc@@ uses Ankara to have fallen back on Russia .
the decline was even greater , as it was committed by an alleged boy@@ friend .
building up the ve@@ to becomes difficult , if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state controlled media made a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria &apos;s areas , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire lie clear on the hand .
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was removed from his office during a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght to the Mediterranean .
this week the State television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to be allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ s formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists are long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West as it regards its response to the attempted tak@@ eover as a weak answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the persistent res@@ ent@@ ment on the sn@@ ail pace of EU accession talks and Putin - who is eager to take advantage of the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of state gained a bonus in Ankara that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat , he called for support for the elected state organs .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a profound fear of regime change .
the summit in this splendid palace on the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to represent an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; as an analy@@ st once described : two countries that feel alien@@ ated from the West and feel bad and now unite .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played a role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it might be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents have said at the press conference that they had not even stri@@ pped the subject .
the President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question of their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
according to the CEO of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself when it had to be collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used to protect other end consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for clients in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alised head office and the listing of stock quotes will change to Nat@@ a@@ West .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for retail banking , which are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor brand as well as the brand among which our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I now say that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals .
each of these brands will stand in their own congregations for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already stated that its Six Nations sponsor will no longer be able to continue sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sporting sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to become a bank of the brands , because how do we concentrate internally ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , one will see many changes .
we can launch these trademarks again , so I think the time has come .

I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the che@@ er when he wins the victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .

Russian Putin moist@@ ur@@ ises Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin recently dis@@ missed Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov &apos;s Chief of Staff .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V has been part of Putin &apos;s closest intimate circle for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as a special representative for environmental and transport issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it is said that Putin has ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the discharge of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration without giving reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was a deputy since 2012 , was named his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Estonian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is said ( in Russian ) that later he was the head of the head of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your activity as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
for a long time , Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest confi@@ dant Vladimir Putin and works as he did for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin on television broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ ig@@ ned upon his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that at this time .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president should at one time lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin cited on the website of the Krem@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to give me this very complicated post - one could almost say - to entr@@ ust this post for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , a former member of the State Security Service ( K@@ GB ) .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was named his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of the five people he trusted most .
it was once believed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia , as Putin &apos;s third term in office had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close ally to Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he struck producers
Gib@@ son participated in a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced his dis@@ miss@@ al in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed publicly on Thursday before the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al .
at the set there was artistic differences and dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character of Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , which follows a team of FB@@ I agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to the statement of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was with him since the first season of the show in 2005 .
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood into the last twelve years , &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday .
I had hoped to be there until the end , but it will no longer be possible .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you could wish for a series .
the scheduled broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
one inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could deal with the 75 fish around Sand@@ als , which were picked out by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , released a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ land Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the project budget of £ 1.@@ 35 billion is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ land ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closing of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 be@@ v@@ elled ropes .
the project of £ 1.@@ 35 billion is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economics , Kei@@ th Brown visited the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witness to an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used for this part of the bridge alone .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate work requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit .
in total , nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck is given a g@@ ong for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted up to its place on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing bridge Construc@@ tors , said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in each bridge project .
with this fantastic project , the closure is future @-@ proof construction and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tur@@ m@@ deck being expanded , we then had to close the existing gap on the north or shore .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very hot activity .
massive , because the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs approx . 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx . 3 % .
delicate because the tolerances on which the team were working were tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ metres .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown from fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station crashed at 13 : 20 BS@@ T on Friday after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved on from their own power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat rolling around and posed the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds blow the boat out of their reach , until we let water go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the boot loader and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have luck un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the boat engine had an emergency stop , it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
someone w@@ akes up today about these men .
seriously injured - a man smo@@ kes his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
as the police arrived yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead , the alcoholic perpet@@ r@@ ator cut off the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice to her .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by his hand and body .
the police could arrest the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothes , he called his mother .
the latter al@@ er@@ ted his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother down .
but she couldn &apos;t move him to leave the apartment .
for this reason she went out of the house with her partner .
on the road they met the ex @-@ partner of the man .
when the two women again entered the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old sho@@ ved his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens are saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Invest@@ ors are to be put more strongly into duty in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Brun@@ swi@@ ck will lose nearly 1,@@ 300 affordable apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD suggests a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; room for action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but argument is programmed .
first of all , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : if you want to build on urban areas , you will have to pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also be built on stock .
the big issue in the town hall is , however , as viol@@ a : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing development programme that will cost millions and still has to be financed shall ensure incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left wants to be tigh@@ tened for investors .
regardless of this , as Brat@@ mann , there is a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market .
if the action plan is implemented , this will take care of additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program is still not complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how does one balance the loss of more than 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be purchased out@@ lining bonds from the city .
in addition , it would have to be considered to bring apartments back to the price binding again .
this is possible in West@@ stadt .
the problem could be solved in one fell s@@ woo@@ p .
because in the West@@ stadt there are periods of time at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments can be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this does not want the owners , the housing companies .
since the number of social housing in the western city is dras@@ tically increased , it is removed from the objective of so @-@ called mixing .
there should be no concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect there to be still movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U must be in the boat for a broad majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have concentrated on more sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it &apos;s fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children don &apos;t go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens has been depl@@ ored by many over the last decade .
Po@@ k@@ emon Go is about getting people off the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then on video games and most recently on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that outdoor technology and outdoor activities don &apos;t mutually exclude each other .
I am referring to Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on characters created initially for the video games in the 1990s ( later a carto@@ on series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , the interest before the release of the game decreased in the US , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand over@@ bur@@ dened by the servers .
within a few days Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and look for Po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and , once they have been found , &quot; captured &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the boat and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person re@@ stores each day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , tracking 35@@ ,000 users , informed the Washington Post recently that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of followed people , who exercise every day 30 minutes , le@@ apt from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees raw data to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to bring about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because many public messages for health are boring and come from people who look appealing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued .
those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing about Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus , three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close friends on the hunt .
as always , there are also gr@@ ump@@ y play@@ des@@ people who have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should it do ?
a breakthrough happened .
even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could already trace our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will decrease over time .
due to Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active will in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the ladies &apos; tower
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant all along the line .
and now an Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast came to a multi @-@ battle title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight on the Olympic Games .
their total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver med@@ alists and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mates A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alli@@ st Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es cont@@ ests on the Swedish beam during the solo multi @-@ campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a multi @-@ fight title and overall the fifth , while she maintains her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey was ending at that moment .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years of its sport , 15 world championship med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ on said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected a final exam in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered a disappointment .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the sing@@ ular multi @-@ campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday while she served as ex@@ clamation mark at the gradu@@ ation ceremony of the team coordinator , Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insist@@ ed , during their long journey to the top , never planned the future , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - containing their typical bar@@ bel pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would suit home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion in the gymn@@ asi@@ um , was exercised in the Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , it has lost no more competition , a series of victories that will last as long as Bil@@ es wishes .
even though Must@@ afa was easily led by two turns , the picture ble@@ w up .
Swedish beam and floor gymn@@ as@@ tics - in which Bil@@ es holds the title of the world - l@@ ur@@ king .
she reg@@ ained again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the Swedish beam - and sat down on the ground with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her final - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow@@ ed on fine glossy red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ afa .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team capit@@ ol , called the American &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; had a head start .
after her ad@@ versity she threw K@@ us@@ sh@@ ausen into the audience , over@@ powered by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning since the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in mass mur@@ der@@ ers when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of the most deadly attacks for a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix , while listening to the car and listening to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fired fire@@ arm while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police said that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of rob@@ ber@@ y , as the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that were owned by one of the adult victims .
the police officer of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected to four previous attacks .
overall , seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic residential areas within four months and two others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is believed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles including a brown N@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder , and it is assumed that it was the serial killer &apos;s work .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ uts and secured a ball out of the seat as well as pu@@ ffer fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with cephal@@ y : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of his anti@@ gens , Ed@@ mund has micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he first came home , my first thought was , I don &apos;t do it .
I don &apos;t manage it .
I didn &apos;t let myself go on that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s not right at all -- of course , one has settled on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund is able to walk with the help of a ga@@ it .
Ed@@ mund was neither able to sit nor craw@@ l up until his third year and he can still not speak .
but he is slow to progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has conceived for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a multitude of causes : genetic as well as in Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to rec@@ alls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time since I didn &apos;t expect it to really tell me anyone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the ci@@ ch@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
you know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives rise to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ ins and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call for the emergency on Friday .
numerous rivers in the south @-@ east Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards had announced that the state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already underway to help the communities in question .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service decre@@ ed that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
a flood warning system was deployed in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama on Friday , while it continued to rain in the Mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite close to Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite close to Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the subur@@ ds near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a downstream in@@ undation in Ascension Par@@ ish is a threat , as these rivers will only flow slowly into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the rivers that have occurred .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams always ab@@ used people from floo@@ ding in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the Sou@@ thwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed from Glo@@ be on Friday .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rose steep@@ ly over night .
he said that another boot @-@ son who lives near him would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed in and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told H@@ ans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
H@@ ans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that emergency sur@@ fers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ be , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities considered ev@@ ac@@ uation directives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer came close to Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil was significantly su@@ cked in due to rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and street floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching workers in five districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ II reported that an assistant in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 in@@ und@@ ated houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , both floo@@ ded .
the leader of the Municip@@ ality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets washed by floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to house the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water starts to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed due to the high water and provided sand bags for the residents to take part , hoping to be able to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a handful of houses were reported to have been floo@@ ded on Thursday , but no reported on Friday .
Kei@@ th Tow@@ n@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; said Tow@@ n@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; en@@ capsul@@ ated by spheres , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police reported that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6 year old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents indicated that Brown suffered several shot wounds , including in the loin , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was in the hospital during his transportation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his little body was dren@@ ched with balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grand@@ mother Del@@ ors Mel@@ ende@@ z told the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the broad@@ ca@@ ster that he would recover .
he would have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition , according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just found out whether there could be one of the injured men in the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators divided C@@ BS Philadelphia that it apparently had come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge shells for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , clas@@ hed the crime scene .
it seems that this was clearly a continuing struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , were seals .
it seems that there have been several armed comb@@ at@@ ants who were involved very actively , &quot; police officers Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di told the police in Philadelphia to the sender .
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently checking reports according to the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 year old girl was hit by a cross @-@ ri@@ p@@ se on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lan@@ e .
she reco@@ vers and the police still looks for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I present myself under the Women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ am@@ ann@@ ess in gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
first , since 1984 I have been at each summer Olympics , and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this crew has three gymn@@ asts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspiring for many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is Catho@@ lics , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an Af@@ ro @-@ Americans .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
for the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas celebrated a surprising Olympic champion and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world championships in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they provided unexpected but master@@ ful gymn@@ astic routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American , who won gold in an individual combined event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we don &apos;t see gymn@@ as@@ tics in the whole country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same path as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison in order to make it into the Olympic team .
they are the Last Five , because the next Olympic team will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics are an expensive sport and gymn@@ asts come first and foremost in private gymn@@ as@@ tics , which are maintained by parents , who pay for training , arran@@ ging , travel and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these clubs are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support business .
in these clubs the Tur@@ ner receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes , since they started the gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to give the congregations au@@ n countless , young girls , inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and accessible gymn@@ as@@ tics training .
I founded my Turn@@ stiftung for 20 years .
in my events , we have offered free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for over 15,000 urban teenagers ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international champi@@ ons .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth of high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ nen develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong advantages for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , which brings thousands of young girls to be interested in gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you for motiv@@ ating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors want to organise further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance doctors who voted in favour of a vote rejected it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July Hun@@ t had revealed plans to forci@@ bly introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS could be found in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man &apos;s land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that any further delay would be harmful for the employees and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first assistants should receive a new contract that contains changes to night and weekend calendar articles to improve the maintenance of non @-@ stop times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chair@@ woman of the B@@ MA committee for assistance physicians shared the last night in a message with &quot; Regi@@ stra@@ r doctors have still raised serious concerns to the proposed contract , in particular that it is the current occupation crisis and it will be given to treat all physicians . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out .
efforts on the part of the B@@ MA to resolve disputes by dialogue clas@@ hed with the government on reluc@@ tance to participate and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was the case of a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t made until the last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the constra@@ int and address the concerns of the assistance physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do so , the assistance doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to cover doctors on the strike chain cover .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA aims to provide a better week@@ day pay for the 5@@ 4.000 in@@ mates who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , urged the assistance doctors to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Labour struggle measures achieve nothing of the only little , but have already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , car@@ egi@@ vers and their families only worries , distress and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months , we talked to the committee of assistance doctors and responded positively to the concerns regarding guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower with the Ministry of Health as well as other mini@@ stries .
employers hope that continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of cur@@ riculum , continuing education and gender pay in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers who were Health Education UK and the Ministry of Health in compliance with the agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce heart rate risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or a further heart attack .
N@@ ICE &apos;s regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
N@@ ICE &apos;s regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form floor@@ ings .
when the flooring breaks apart , it can cause a blood c@@ lot that c@@ aches the blood flow to the heart and thus causes a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the N@@ ICE draft resolution , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health technology evaluation center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who had a heart attack .
with T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or &apos;s preliminary recommendation , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture flour@@ ishes in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ ry Rah@@ man was removed last year on the occasion of a government report on corruption from office
a culture of political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to ignor@@ ing widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities as a devastating government report today .
the former member of Cab@@ inet , Sir Eric Pick@@ les , verb@@ ally attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town coun@@ cils to ignore electoral abuse because of &quot; intoler@@ ances of eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Local Government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut @-@ off belts outside of electoral cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
he recommends that voters should have a badge to prove their identity in elections .
at the moment a vot@@ er must mention his name and address .
the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink to a person &apos;s finger when they leave their vote to prevent someone elec@@ ting twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only condu@@ ci@@ ve to electoral fraud , but should also protect the local government against the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that comes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special selection tri@@ bunal decided that the acting mayor of Lut@@ fur was to be reli@@ eved of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry after a lit@@ any .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had &quot; per@@ ver@@ ted &quot; the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ist and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of im@@ itation in which one person was chosen as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud across the country .
he expressed himself particularly alar@@ ming for the frau@@ dul@@ ent choice of letters - among the older members of the Muslim community had pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the leadership of ID cards to prove identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , especially communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions had ignor@@ antly ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 Recommen@@ dations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists edit letter sel@@ ections to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election re@@ ap &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing according to your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has left her voice to prevent anyone selecting twice .
to carry out systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for automatic mail @-@ selection .
ban that political activists edit full letter sel@@ ections and envel@@ opes of local elections .
the police have the authority to shut down sel@@ ections for election stations .
a change of legislation facilit@@ ated an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the People &apos;s Act 1983 .
prohibition of photography in poll@@ ing stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the electoral station ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees generally asser@@ t that voters go to the bal@@ lot box alone .
Sir Eric passes through the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing , &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ lets case no criminal complaint was placed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Elec@@ toral Tribunal has declared Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty for a number of reasons - in accordance with the high requirements of the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registration departments of the Rath@@ au@@ splatz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Court of Justice in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country is a proud heir as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy about K@@ ate Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous double @-@ go@@ ers of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the Olympic Games 2016 in Rio will get out of line with the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T this week , which has proven to be an impressive double @-@ go@@ er of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic spirit is by far not the only ath@@ lete competing for gold , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media faith .
hon@@ oring the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Games that have more than a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : crew member of the U.S. squ@@ ad in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio
apart from K@@ ate &apos;s Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the rac@@ et@@ rack , many people on the Internet indicated how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the crew member of the US crew in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a storm on Twitter after pictures on which he looks incredibly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t see any great simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy der Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good @-@ looking guy , so I do it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly highlight this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes should go through as a Doppel@@ gän@@ ger for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one step higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the inc@@ eption actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another modest comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ mut , who is similar to heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va shows more than just the sun@@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian has been att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the simil@@ arities
theory put into space : according to this user , there may be one reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an unbeliev@@ ably similar face form and eyes .
other popular Ver@@ iden@@ s covered K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , broad smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ ologi@@ zes for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Canadian broad@@ ca@@ ster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers went off &quot; like a low , &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought his microphone was off when he left his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ estyle Pool .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought aboard in the C@@ BS comment@@ ator team to give more &quot; color , &quot; one could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old quin@@ es@@ in lost the union , baby . &quot;
too excited , she went down like a pig , and died like a pig .
thank you for it .
the Chinese float in Ai , Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor leap , which allowed the Canadian to close the gap to China .
viewers across Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not get the idea that they were still on air . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Mar@@ han from China was described in the fin@@ als 4 x 200m Fre@@ estyle swi@@ mmer for women as follows : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old quin@@ es@@ in lost the union , baby . &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with which many put him to talk .
Twitter users didn &apos;t get back when they heard how in@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let &apos;s all look like ra@@ cists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a short time later Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC program , was responsible for the commentary by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the commentary was broadcast on a floating performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ happy chosen phrase , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for 90 times with people responding to the rel@@ a@@ unch on Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ aining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and released a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
yesterday night we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on show and our followers in social media .
to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ s comments referring to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy chosen wording . By@@ ron is doing what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s pool in the C@@ BC Olympic Games , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referred to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about woman trying in the middle of the business sham@@ elessly under@@ wear
the buyers did not know where to look , when a woman went out to dress her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation she looked at her , pulled her out and put her back on the shelf .
she continued to browse and ta@@ sted four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman ta@@ sted the under@@ pants before putting them back to the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in the store at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled her own stock@@ ings and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everybody star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , because she put them on the rack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three further under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , moved again and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who could possibly buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How to think wrong@@ ly that someone would take home pants that had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , employees have tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman touched her and pulled out and didn &apos;t wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products coming into question were withdrawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself from weapons attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it somewhat safer for you .
we talked with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you &apos;re approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how you can flip the spe@@ ar for your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when one approaches you from behind , you should turn it first , so you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; move out of the shot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before you hit it with your free el@@ bow .
strike it with your knees in the gro@@ in and twist , while the aggres@@ sor bows down against pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him .
for attack@@ ers approaching from the front the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot , grab the weapon and twist it so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot .
shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and beat the attack@@ er to the chest , then twist the weapon out of its handle before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it pre@@ fers Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est way to hand over your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
traveler Ian W@@ right ab@@ uses for a travel guide his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller sub@@ contracted the immune system and the perf@@ ecting of a serious test by le@@ ver@@ aging some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k ab@@ stained from a Euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a fau@@ c@@ et of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before the check @-@ out of every object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to get in .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the thought to check the sink of a traction toilet , which has been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his bow@@ el by traveling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
from public rail@@ roads to train stations to washing links of toilets , the task turned its immune system definitely under one sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he told : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was in any case justified .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test finish showed a lumin@@ ometric rating of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ ometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a r@@ ussi@@ an toilet which he refused to refuse after its lumin@@ ance quantity was over 4000 units , whereas fresh washed hands have one out of less than 60 .
Mr W@@ right and the Finnish maker of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; showing the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That comes close to the worst I have sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I &apos;m not going to lick here because it is disgu@@ sting inside .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company is equi@@ pping Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the development of intestinal bacteria and immune systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ o Senior Venice president for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
we carried out crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I had instructed him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting r@@ ussi@@ an toilet which is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to ar@@ ouse them and others in which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria particularly associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destroyed before del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing social flat in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social housing after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation with a damage of £ 50,000 because it had terrori@@ zed their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ done and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ gu@@ cock were cast after a long list of complaints by their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
when they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employers found property in ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls have holes , wooden boards were pil@@ ed up , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for the home administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I think people don &apos;t have to live in that way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property will probably be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also the same .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had joined was street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ aming , stri@@ pping and cur@@ sing .
Skel@@ done , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an order for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house , which will be torn down under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found .
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , wooden boards were torn up
neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be inv@@ oked by the police on a regular basis .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ gi@@ zed her and her partner forci@@ bly from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ im@@ itation were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their life was made hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t shock anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived for 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we &apos;re not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood Erasmus cement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , stated that it would have agreed to co @-@ operate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals , 20 years long
on the over@@ grown side of the church , garbage and old toys were thrown down .
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for her behaviour and her family , as a delay is always the last step that Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing takes into account .
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information we have provided .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conve@@ ys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ iling on the ground .
workers of property management will now have to swe@@ ep away garbage mountains surrounding the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ done received a fine after she ple@@ aded guilty to the owner of a class B drug in commercial view .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ done , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after they were homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many walls of the house were decorated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say they will deleg@@ ate ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela C@@ row of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police said that the del@@ usion is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ reproach and those who have been har@@ med by such behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that continues to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal stag@@ ger@@ ed after an eff@@ ig@@ ent military jet over@@ flies the beach
sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the Air Force put an unbelievable storm flight
the Air Force stated that it was on a training flight , but insist@@ ed that there was no security risk .
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists started to panic after an eff@@ ig@@ matic jet crashed over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew close to the sun wor@@ ship@@ pers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers j@@ umped up when they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the drive systems without first seeing what came to them through the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holi@@ day@@ makers who posted videos on the dramatic F@@ ly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; it flew two times really deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane falling on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fis@@ her boats off the coast and to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that due to the poor visibility the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to the poor visibility conditions , but the air forces insist@@ ed that security was at no time at risk .
carpet fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where also four people on the island Madeira came to death .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - heavy fog and smoke - which restric@@ ts his view .
the aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot needed to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise .

Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete against FC Sevilla in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup , the back@@ lash desc@@ ends three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ W@@ inners will have to rel@@ inqu@@ ish N@@ ey@@ mar in the balance of power with the inferior Cup@@ fin@@ alist and reig@@ ning European League Champion , who cont@@ ests Brazil &apos;s Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
also missing Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen .
the German suffered a change of change in the training in the training , thus clari@@ fying the demand for Bar@@ ca at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
for two years , the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen compete for the status as number one for two years .
in this respect , coach Luis En@@ rique reno@@ unc@@ ed a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the other candidates took the lead .
before the first compulsory game of the new season there is doubt about the fitness condition of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool at 0 : 4 .
Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really convince even at the 3 : 2 in the pro@@ p @-@ stop to S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday .
Sev@@ ille , in turn , has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and aim for the second triumph in the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with up to now eleven successes , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition .
Ma Long in a separate league for table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The chin@@ ese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his coun@@ try@@ man and title defender Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
with this the World Ran@@ king First took the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at the World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ als Tournam@@ ent and the Olympics .
bronze went to Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ rei@@ ani .
the two Chinese , as expected , made it into the final game and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top of the Olympia @-@ podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between the sentences and with time @-@ outs , they had no coaches with them .
they had pulled back on the grand@@ stand and left their prot@@ ectors on top of each other in a fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mat to this place I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang had said logical . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ als posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had to fight only in the first set with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent .
after that he determined the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
the su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of Ma did not develop the expected intoxic@@ ating match .
but nevertheless , sufficient breath @-@ taking ballo@@ ons were to be seen .
Mi@@ rei@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ fin@@ als against the German champion D Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White Russians held a ri@@ b injury , after that in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to settle with sheet metal .
by the way , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) were in similar high table tennis @-@ age Olympic @-@ Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tr@@ ump ad@@ mits &quot; huge problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now announced weaknesses of his election campaign in U@@ tah &apos;s hitherto republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old .
a rare moment in which the mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire usually appears large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident as concerns correspon@@ ded as correspon@@ dents .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals inside his own Republi@@ can camp , doubts pers@@ ist in his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump from Evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt is false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his famous media intoxic@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds shake
U@@ tah is usually a secure bench for the Republi@@ cans .
according to a survey conducted by Surv@@ ey@@ US from June , Tr@@ ump and his rival received from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutions see tr@@ ump in the front , but not by the distance that can be used for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
also Arizona and Georgia are considered endangered .
in an interview with the CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clin@@ tons : &quot; just as I did before . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either be successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t do anything else than telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , this is al@@ right , says Tr@@ ump further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party is said to have threatened to aboli@@ sh funding for the support of his election campaign , he should not be able to present any better poll@@ s .
instead , the nom@@ inees of the Republi@@ cans should be stronger than the arms of Congress .
Olympia : three @-@ day fraud in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C aims to set up a disciplinary committee .
Ken@@ y@@ as athletes face the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro after the second dop@@ ing affair .
after a screening test during a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee decided to promptly set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary informed that the former Spr@@ inter and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine test in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner , F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch .
this was reported to the team management of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF world association has asked the IO@@ C for information on the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , distributed an IA@@ AF or@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the examination and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch , submitted the sample and signed , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete , who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch had become more than 800 metres in Beijing in 2015 .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics delegation , Michael Ro@@ ti@@ ch , had been sub@@ trac@@ ted from the Rio Olympics .
he is said to have informed about outstanding dop@@ ing tests against cash payments from his country .
according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested in Nairobi on his return .
in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing contracts , Kenya has been under special surveillance for some time now .
during the announcement of more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls presented by the IO@@ C before the Rio games , it was usually pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
before the summer games in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics .
subsequently , WA@@ DA took Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control was compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the country &apos;s athletes won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports the ARD has repeatedly raised accus@@ ations that dop@@ ing drugs are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a substantial ment@@ ality of sports fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently demanded a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired her in Russian athle@@ tics .
it has been proven that this sport method has been systematically and systematically reduced .
Russian athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games .
the &quot; West Side Story &quot; by Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival hosts the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic love pair , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the West Side Story , Le@@ flu@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins Master@@ piece .
the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled her with the role of Mary a youth night@@ mare .
orchest@@ ral dig@@ ging the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the leadership of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she rec@@ alls with nostal@@ gia to her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first of all because it &apos;s musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Maria &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so it &apos;s clever , naturally also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character , whom I have as Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with it .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli yields the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece is about prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ories went to New York , and the New York residents didn &apos;t want them .
these are the same themes , and they are as meaningful today as at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London School Girl , which joined IS , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za sul@@ ana , one of three British school girls left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was thought that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s bul@@ war@@ k in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died after giving information to her family shortly after she pre@@ tended to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as remin@@ ding and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from the east of London came to an airplane towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told they had married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain as candidates for the Supreme Court in the case of an electoral victory in Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked Gary &apos;s confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor to the late judge at Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia &apos;s Supreme Court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said during a telephone conference on Thursday that he was expecting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rei@@ d &apos;s spokesperson said later that he had not yet talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he was spec@@ ul@@ ating .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not care for rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the US Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Republi@@ cans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , were lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also stated that Donald Tr@@ ump is in@@ appropriate for the pres@@ idency .
Tre@@ ats wants to make nude calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine co @-@ operates with photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to publish a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked human beings , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
at the beginning of this year , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w tells us that his nude magazine of old@@ school play@@ boys is different , as &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently , it is the view that it does the calendar too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to return to the presentation of timeless and classic nec@@ essi@@ ties where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release on the release of the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally in an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community anticip@@ ates mass exo@@ dus
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t fit and Erdo@@ gan pra@@ ises , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ oriented foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
in the short term , the Kur@@ d municipality of Germany anticip@@ ates tens of thousands of people who are seeking refuge from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term it could even become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; believes the president of the band Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the tough pr@@ ero@@ g@@ ative of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ d municipality of Germany anticip@@ ates a mass exo@@ dus to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of people , in the medium term , with some hundred thousand prot@@ ectors from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government has already over@@ dra@@ fted Kurdish stron@@ gh@@ olds with criminal off@@ sets months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing Turkey .
after the beaten coup , there are still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks .
many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can &apos;t be that a state that welcomes refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the association lam@@ ented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Beng@@ haz@@ i cities .
this means that Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of Con@@ federation called for the Federal Government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria be positioned against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics is taking place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel no longer safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the fire mark as a Gü@@ len pendant destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; anyone who does not suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the K@@ em@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ ari@@ sts , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ affiliated foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported by the paper , referring to figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks introduced the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , this was 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all identified ( 3@@ 9,@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this elevation there are not those who are fle@@ eing war , poverty or lack of perspective .
asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individual prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to vote on the Land@@ tag .
they have understood in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
in 2021 , the Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because it &apos;s not stupid until now : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ to @-@ day elections - that is bit@@ ing .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the election fighters , are on vacation .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers in the country , on Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the country &apos;s day .
practical problems come about : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and end up voices are difficult to find .
until 4 September 2016 , the final and final days of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign shortly before the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear for his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s .
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition du@@ el .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years of age and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign .
he travels across the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as he did his legendary word @-@ like predecessor , Harald Ring@@ storff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , sea @-@ ring has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel has the blame for the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has spe@@ eded up the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its peak channel data , the Minister of Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , when at the wrong time at the right place , election campaigns are made .
she has invited German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale demonstrations ; Merkel &apos;s election of the German Bundestag is in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s a shame not to listen to Angela Merkel from other corners of Germany .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast @-@ CD@@ U largely ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual campaign states on market places and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ ert thinks , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Union , too , has noticed that on the land you are crum@@ bling the base that it has to be very tight to find a wire to the people again .
you see it as the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly exists in the sides of the country .
however , the advice of the CD@@ U election fighter Kok@@ ert to his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called out its SPD into a particularly committed electoral campaign .
in poll@@ s , the S &amp; D Group la@@ stly lag@@ ged behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just shortly before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 , the SPD was still clearly winning 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in surveys , should make the leap into the land @-@ day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make a modern virtue of the necessity of vac@@ ations and largely mig@@ rate their campaign to the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; calls it the local president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise green campaig@@ ners are embark@@ ing on a search for traces of local ab@@ stain@@ ers among the holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , curi@@ ously curves with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer under lock
at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain about .
there is a lot of praise for those responsible for the construction works , which begin at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end at 8 : 00 p.m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have made everything quite jag@@ ged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no delay .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ owed will also be the opposite of those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accommodation entran@@ ces &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site has moved to the south on Monday and the block@@ age of the asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and the connection to Rot@@ tenburg has again subsi@@ ded , the traffic situation within the village has eased .
citizens can now travel from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the travel through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been considerable discomfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Florian King responsible for the transport management of the refur@@ bish@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ k@@ strasse , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ strasse , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ ders had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping routes were seeking and more familiar to their navigation device than sign@@ posting .
what led to the fact that some truck stops in residential areas fran@@ tically .
as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the community also called for the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been significant transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have already been carved .
the quick@@ est was on the way at 77 km / h in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a little con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg , the street is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the maps .
but the fact that the B 27 renovation has led to revenue losses in them makes everyone look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. for other companies , have hardly any consequences for them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even at the deal@@ er@@ ship Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; at the most light decline , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that of course &quot; the term &quot; is missing . &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the restaurants along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crowned , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential threatening .
not only him , but all the restaurants have &quot; hit hard . &quot;
the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we have to be glad about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sales revenue is reduced to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road renovation has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of his associates have to dis@@ miss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dis@@ missed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt has replied to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner whether there could be a financial compensation , otherwise the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the refur@@ bish@@ ment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where something more generous was handled .
with all complaints G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , family business has been here since 17@@ 15 and refers to the long history .
that other regular guests now look less frequently due to the complicated traffic guidance , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t come here , it is also very nice .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his pedi@@ gree is returning to the end of the renovation work .
despite the crises with BSE and a bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on his customers for the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history of history .
six months of construction work , that &apos;s already brutal .
all the time , in the name of the fight against terror , laws are tigh@@ tened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what does a winding state have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Vers@@ ati@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all of his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t overwhel@@ m anyone .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as the Minister of the Interior , he was on results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère took up a little time before he presents his conclusions for the security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
a lot is already known , announced , pointed out : that a new security authority is supposed to take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
nor is it the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and tru@@ ce law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère begins a second attempt for proposals that have not been done with the SPD : he wants to make sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty , and to press jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CD@@ U husband . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still considers this to be reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything that does not have any chances in the coalition partner anyway .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also presents a few new ideas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have partly in themselves : he plans express methods for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ecting people from deport@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees that are systematically caught up in the country are expected to check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of des@@ ul@@ ties for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than previously - for example those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to veil their identity .
some of it is politically and judi@@ ci@@ ally delicate .
many things still have an effect on us and leave questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does this have to do with safety and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
in addition , many people were worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees .
and things that people deeply occupied did not let themselves be cl@@ ung out during election campaign times .
the inner security has moved tremend@@ ously into focus .
first stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are campaigns .
for this reason , the Union and the SPD are increasingly concerned with internal security .
in the past few days there was a high point between the two parties .
only a gar@@ than argument about the equi@@ pping of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the department chiefs also call for a Bur@@ ka ban and a departure from dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling with conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he doesn &apos;t hold anything from a departure from the double pass .
we satisfied the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ vo@@ ke it is not sensible .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he had constitutional obj@@ ections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner , must first show itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there &apos;s a lot of things in there , which could cause fights .
the SPD , too , is currently attempting to benefit from internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel clearly sign@@ alizes a willingness to talk and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still performing gli@@ m@@ pf@@ lich .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery volumes worldwide are increasing .
but not all markets are running smoothly .
in the recall action there is a vor@@ tex around a term .
Volkswagen launches its shipments in the second half of the year .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer can continue to boast a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the Volkswagen power brand was weaker , especially in Western Europe , and thus again loaded the total sales , as the company noted in the D@@ ax .
worldwide , the VW brand in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month .
in the home market of Germany the deliveries dropped by almost one sixth .
chief brand leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann brought back the weaker numbers from July , especially on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there has been a reluc@@ tance to buy in some core markets through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the withdrawal from the EU was also bur@@ dened by a spokes@@ woman .
in the U.S. , where the exhaust gas generation first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected landmark of Lower Saxony will continue to gli@@ de through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an ex@@ tradition minus 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles will be found .
group sales chief Fred Kap@@ pler continued to report a sales report from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated by a software package .
in Germany alone , VW is calling for some 2.5 million vehicles to retro@@ fit into the workshops .
in the course of the re@@ arm@@ ament , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars had no negative effects .
after conversion of vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
after upgrading the car , the car manufacturer guarantees a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certification , but does not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was said on Friday in corporate travel .
the reason is legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now grants its German customers a guarantee for retro@@ fitted diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed by VW representatives in the German Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
it was confirmed by the Ministry of Transport that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully satisfied the requirements of my inquiry commission and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from these are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed the guarantee that in the event of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine capacity after conversion , no deterior@@ ations will take place and all type appro@@ vals relevant vehicle values will remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was called in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; War@@ ran@@ ty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , customers can come to a workshop for half a year after the conversion - and this could result in the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in customer interest it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage , which has nothing to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; an uncertainty concerning possible guarantees shall be as it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands criminal interest from rich savers in future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Bank CEO Josef Paul said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Federal Association of German B@@ anks appeals to an individual case and does not see it as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers don &apos;t have to fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pay pen@@ alties for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when banks deposit money for night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0,@@ 4 percent penalty .
this fee demands the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from September by private and corporate customers for deposits over € 100,000 on sight deposit accounts or day money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost € 400 in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time , he has be@@ ware of 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the central bank account and have a cost of 0.4 per cent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief of the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the cost is now continued .
leaving the cash in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four cases , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the Bank@@ note .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other types of investment .
very few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry you alone , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically durable not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thur@@ in@@ gian Volks@@ - und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with p@@ uni@@ tive interest for in@@ soles of three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , head of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide wages for deposits , therefore the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is far too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said that at Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele which is a bit more luxuri@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when she paid for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is currently not well @-@ known for other banks that charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said speaker Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into negative with the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
competition is hard , and it is threatening to emig@@ rate from investors to competition .
the customers in Germany will not be pleased with this in the l@@ atitude .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys sil@@ enc@@ ers ?
l@@ one middle @-@ aged men love records .
before you go to the comment section to see him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ Alle@@ gr@@ an Men &apos;s Middle Ages with harsh insul@@ ts , this statement diver@@ ts itself from current data .
according to You@@ g@@ v , the re@@ emergence of vinyl records is not based on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but rather to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght after the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely herb group .
there is also no hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog was a news report on television , I would follow the camera while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a humble grey suit and gra@@ zing wild@@ ly before I stop , hold my hands and say something better like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of Soh@@ o slowly gets lost in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices fill up the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record stores .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , to whom I am Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) in Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I wonder ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4.000 records .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him at home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a significant number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably were a little too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers , who he meets , apply to You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also notices a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and get to see their old records again .
from the conversations I have conducted , people usually get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of fans of the record revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers accepted the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record covers , from objects that call happy rejo@@ icing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is for me as a collector so and I think it is so with a lot of people .
it is a simple way to mentally engage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee fle@@ es from a stack of tables . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard of it .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I smo@@ other through a pile of bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; someone came here just recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so that I can put it on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less music @-@ style .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones who come in slowly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ opp , which has devoted almost an entire floor to the records , has a nice audience when I go in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops , Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest syn@@ thesi@@ zers and sex@@ i@@ ri@@ ated pop instead of experimental jazz are sounding out of the loudspeakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks stran@@ gely lonely , but serious mental trau@@ mas are hard to find when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates for sale .
it rather makes a window display rather than a big shopping .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , therefore collecting sheets is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives with a loving si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of panel lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while giving the impression to sign the den@@ im pants , I watch a group of young age girls who group around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates .
even though my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , dis@@ regard the large number of female collectors and turn@@ tables that exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they spend their th@@ urs@@ day morning with security , not with flo@@ ats from Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets through plates while they fl@@ atter the gaze of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old fake moder@@ ator , who hun@@ ts over shoulders of un@@ susp@@ ecting middle @-@ aged men .

French Court re@@ jects offer on demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camps
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
in a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary businesses where individuals within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to en@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , bar@@ ber services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which harbour a risk of fire and san@@ ity .
humanitarian groups told the Court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported unification and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that food business , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than only people who live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the tear@@ ing was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des Lager , which is operated in the community and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid agencies Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants rated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle has increased to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number right now - following a steep increase of newcom@@ ers during the summer .
despite Olympic di@@ sil@@ lu@@ sion@@ ment : Martin remains fighting
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing appearance at the Olympic time , Rad@@ mund@@ i Tony Martin won &apos;t be able to stop .
&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , remain confident and fight , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro with Facebook .
he has no explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s hard to comment on the timing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to analyze in peace what reasons had led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
at the time @-@ driving world championship in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything that we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also counts my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ time world champion , who had lost on the 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes on Olympic Champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Be@@ am went to the start with his offer in January and already has more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but also intervene .
for example , they can rel@@ inqu@@ ish players missions and face enemies as well as provide equipment .
the game giant Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard launches a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sport .

here comes the Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed meas@@ urer : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested which are meant to handle Tem@@ po@@ unders very effectively .
the futur@@ istic Enfor@@ cement tra@@ ilers of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used in accident situations where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itated bridges with temporary speed limit , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is maintained .
however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : in continuous measurement mode , its battery lasts five days , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
with Laser Meas@@ u@@ rement Technology , all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks .
variable speed limits and access restrictions after time , lane and vehicle class can also be monitored .
the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer .
in order for it to be st@@ owed simply , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels disappear in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also a bul@@ let @-@ proof outer she@@ ath .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to the specifications of Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain fet@@ ches silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Masters class gets gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ er rug@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ us Stadium in Rio .
Fi@@ ji distributed a master class in handling , side @-@ stepping , moving , line running and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was swe@@ pt through the not too bad silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the marked defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back to them in the final .
but regardless of this Fi@@ ji would have hit a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in this form .
it might be a con@@ sol@@ ation for the UK - but it will probably not - that at least one br@@ ite will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s head coach Ben Ry@@ an , the former head of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
the GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago Ry@@ an lost all the games at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they only lost one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began to wonder and allowed the attacks of GB@@ s to boun@@ ce off .
it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. to run into driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au over@@ came in the corner .
with four minutes of play , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner , which he changed .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a rus@@ hed T@@ ack@@ le of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but he only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute Ath@@ j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua left a touch@@ down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the kick @-@ off and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a goal .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while the UK was still learning .
that is how it is .
G@@ GB made basic changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant interim play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an experiment for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went off for a long time in favor of the South se@@ ap@@ sul@@ men , whose fans sang , flags wa@@ ved and d@@ anced on the grand@@ stand .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame replaced the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced itself and GB bent down crus@@ hing into the grass .
earlier on that day , Fi@@ ji had defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a tight semi @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks to the front in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer to the ru@@ dder bridge
there will be no more em@@ bl@@ ematic gold than in these games and that will mean something .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard p@@ ieve that enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was omni@@ present when they recru@@ ited for the second Olympic @-@ old in the second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sport , who laid on such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9.@@ 000 un@@ written application , which is also exemplary .
what we see are two brilliant athletes gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the style of the Arc de Tri@@ om@@ p@@ he .
behind each gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and it was no more an assistant than the trainer who did not know if he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that did it .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was fortunate that he was able to commen@@ ce treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the interruption to a minimum , if that was the correct term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory went their first thoughts to Williams , who spent a nerve wre@@ cking tomorrow doing something more than usual and trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning who was a Captain of the Royal Arti@@ llery regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . it might be a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we wouldn &apos;t be one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up , p@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very trapped in the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t out to do something nice .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about its future .
Glo@@ ver needs to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic Champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ensured clarity for 31 years
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , retired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water utility as a model for large water producers .
this was the name of the Bavarian Radio Broad@@ casting Company some time ago .
a little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia s@@ las@@ hed the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sailed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ ally as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who worked for 31 years in the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zw@@ eck@@ verband &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 28 years as Managing Director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
the drinking water sports association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , the community of Breit@@ brun@@ n , annually fo@@ sters about 150@@ 000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member municipalities are the municipalities Kirch@@ heim , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
water supply contracts are available for further cities and municipalities .
the current Chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ n mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was hired as a water@@ man in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ Board in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they stretched from water management and maintenance work on office and organization activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as outstanding events she called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the renovation of the high containers ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the renewal of water pipes .
there was no down@@ time and there was always new additions , because water was the most important food for drinking water and drinking water .
in her lau@@ d@@ atio , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he used a lot of lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od for his water sport band@@ age and he used the water sport association to live as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group for nit@@ rate reduction before the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for that he received a lot of praise and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on his part praised Aqu@@ arian Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water wart and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view , he described the construction of the well and the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - a man shooting at risk of life
on Friday , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot on his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n County ) and injured it in a deadly way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself and stated to have shot his companion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , after which he will be publicly tra@@ m@@ pled .
meanwhile , Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burnt and has a bald head .
meanwhile , the police have published a photo of him .
it is , however , a few years old .
in the meantime , the man is wearing a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police .
whoever sees Sven S. will call the 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator in 1981 .
in the first place , the responsible police in Lü@@ beck did not want to provide information on the day or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but she confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a Special Operations Command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for German Steel Industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of dollars .
financial burdens that the sector threatened with green electricity production are from the table .
it remains in the release of the Renewable Energy In@@ disp@@ ense with the existing plants for the so @-@ called own electricity production in the German steel industry , &quot; said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday issue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z that there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel works are replaced are an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent .
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on self @-@ electricity production .
thus the status quo of the present regulation is largely fixed .
the successful effort made by Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also with the reform of the emission rights trade , climate and employment targets are to be weigh@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; IG Metall @-@ chief Jörg Hof@@ mann stated in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered from over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation continued to ag@@ grav@@ ate when the world &apos;s largest producer in China threw masses of steel on the world market in view of the ailing domestic demand .
European manufacturers have dump@@ ed Chinese steel companies price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has eased a little .
on the one hand , imposed tari@@ ffs on import steel are showing effect , on the other hand , economic prospects have brigh@@ tened up in China .
it is not clear how long the price recovery is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least the prices would have been stagn@@ ating .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
finally Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to close the closure of individual works .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July German steel manufacturers are cau@@ tious in spite of rising prices and increasing orders .
at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday .
after a brief up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the prepared amount left for the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been down two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increasing output .
community , spirit , health : singing is good sen@@ iors
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in the teacher &apos;s degree course she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old is singing in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels well @-@ balanced , cheerful and more lively , she says .
in doing so , she does something good for her health and mind .
singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German sen@@ iors division .
most of the sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
regular toge@@ ther@@ ness allows senior citizens to soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their chor@@ us : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of toge@@ ther@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be stren@@ uous in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
after all , sen@@ iors train deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly challenge his lungs are not as fast as they can in everyday life .
even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at age , singing is an optimal hobby .
for older people , Sing@@ ing often has a very special effect , says Ursul@@ a L@@ enz of the Federal Working Group of the Sen@@ iors Organ@@ iz@@ ations .
in the older generations , common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , it explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
lyrics and especially melodies tend to de@@ duce people who are suffering from dementia .
in singing , a special performance is demanded to the head , explains L@@ enz .
concentr@@ ating simultaneously on one &apos;s voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge .
just elderly people who live alone practice not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one hears through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ este@@ em grows through singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I do something for a long time , I &apos;ll get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing is enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears when a sound goes wrong ?
looking for the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior boy &apos;s choir , one can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly .
many senior choirs can also be found over the internet .
if you do not have access to the internet , your family , friends or neighbours can ask for help from the internet research .
those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does well and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for all ages .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than males at cri@@ es of young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , what effect the calling of cat babies has on adult animals .
to their surprise , the mi@@ ch@@ ewing also did not leave the males cold - however , they beha@@ ved always the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the reg@@ ression of cat bab@@ ys at the ch@@ ewing of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , which are in great need , such as scientists from the veter@@ inary university and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) found out .
males react also to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young for the males are either not perc@@ ei@@ vable or not significant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding said of the MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology .
in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cri@@ es differs with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy .
altogether nine adult males and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were performed for a herd of little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger stir@@ red k@@ itt@@ ens , which were additionally raised .
despite the low sample , the researchers keep their results conclu@@ sive .
&quot; all the females , even those who did not have their own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they turned faster to the speaker , when this rep@@ ut@@ ations of the very excited kit@@ ten played .
this ability may possibly be inn@@ ate or develop@@ e with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bi@@ ologist said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men on baby sounds .
some studies also showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to babies , no matter if they were already mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Super@@ cup &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ cu@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant was issued against the former Hak@@ an Sü@@ p@@ r football star in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match will be held in Turkey .
before Du@@ eling the arch @-@ ri@@ vals between Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay , Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even at the suspension of the state of emergency after the attempted coup attempt in July , the government warned that the daily life of normal citizens should not be com@@ promised .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len responsible for the attempted coup attempt .
even before football it is not stopped .
the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office issued an arrest warrant against the former Stark@@ ie Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r .
accordingly , the South African living in America has now been accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kiss will be the trailer of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who will be held responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency first suspended for 90 days is still valid until October , but in fact most Turks have no effect on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places all over the country has declared Erdo@@ gan to be finished on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what unites the fur@@ s of the Turks in the face of dramatic experience in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even fans agree , no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; it will be especially returned to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski .
in the past season , Cologne presented its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old completed his first season as the top scor@@ er of his association .
in the final game against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and his team secured the tro@@ phy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; f@@ arewell too early in the European League .
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g there was only sixth place .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did that and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the game year was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season hits as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ pe @-@ King laid the base for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the 31 year old .
following the coup attempt at AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez borrow@@ ed from the AC in Florence after the coup d &quot; é@@ tat failed to return because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club chief Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but to do so , the stri@@ ker would have to be willing to wai@@ ve about a third of its worth of 7.5 million Euros . Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als @-@ opportunities at Olympia in Rio
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ line , 34 years old , was banned twice due to dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova won &apos;t start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they are fighting in Rio around med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing determines the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian flo@@ ater , Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ ova , who had lam@@ ented her starting right just before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was sw@@ apped and hat@@ ched mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters of breast ) .
there was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scenery : with a set smile she was still standing in the hall and provoked her appearance .
when it was established that it would not get gold , the audience broke out into a jubil@@ ee .
but there are many other athletes , who compete in the Olympic Games in Rio despite the dop@@ ing past .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ line ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was banned twice due to dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion 2004 and ex @-@ world champion has been running even faster than before , he is the number one in the world for more than 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ e@@ as@@ el / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to leave a six @-@ month lock@@ out in 2010 after having proven the taking of the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
she had severe tooth@@ ache after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Dis@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 World Champion won a positive response to the banned stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the sei@@ s@@ mic intake and was locked for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion more than 400 m , was positive tested in 2010 and closed for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement was responsible , mar@@ ched mer@@ ges .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world for over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ fall , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete has been awarded as many med@@ als afterwards .
thus T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having been diagnosed with testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing .
in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to leave Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European title because of testosterone deficiency .
he also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment of the International Court of Sports .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world ranking .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record holder and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was only positive tested in May but may still start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , indications of taking a banned food supplement have been found , the lock of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA was mild and ran already on July 13 .
bombing terror in Thailand - Austri@@ ans injured - Sever@@ al death
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday early .
she has suffered cuts and had been treated at the hospital , but I have already been able to leave it again .
she planned her return journey at the beginning of September .
whether the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon are also Austrian citizens , is still unclear .
the Department of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , such as Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
at approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok located Hu@@ a H@@ in , two bombs explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a b@@ ypass .
according to police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning , two explo@@ sives went up again , and another man was killed , according to the authorities .
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured in the det@@ onation near the famous seaside resort of Pat@@ ong .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the south @-@ east coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an employee .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower bed before the Re@@ vier of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police .
finally , there were several wounded in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon at the south @-@ east coast .
it was called by a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in .
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said Army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ an@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday early in front of journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express itself on possible motives - but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks that is typical of the Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ gency movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary , one assumes that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta .
the authorities would have kept secret references to upcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days - however , they were not informed about the exact time and location .
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police put their officials across the country to enhance security around important government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they are not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used for years by Thailand King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the well @-@ fle@@ dged bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommended on its homepage to follow the instructions given by the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ ate , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and the surrounding area .
after disputes between the security forces and the Muslim population , not necessary trips to these provinces will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this gives the military enormous influence in the coming years .
Jun@@ ta Chef and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country was moving towards stability , improving economic conditions and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody ri@@ ots , is able to keep the kingdom in order to restore stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the revol@@ ting uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok by a assault on a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has come to the visor of the Federal Office of Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several national offices , the constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evidence of efforts against the free @-@ going democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Chairman of the Constitutional Court , Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ azi@@ z of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East are being vili@@ fied in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we are watching the movement now too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; multic@@ ultur@@ alism , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot;
constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in nine states - Bremen , Bayern , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Nieder@@ sachsen , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - are already observing &quot; identity . &quot;
Ma@@ fe@@ asts said that his authority was closely aligned with the state offices during the decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to speak with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the ties of Islam@@ ists as well as the extre@@ mi@@ sts of law .
this is not a fu@@ tile advertisement for one &apos;s own thing .
propaganda should appeal to people emo@@ tionally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
last but not least , several federal states had reports on the contacts of the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; to Af@@ D politicians .
Ma@@ ate said he didn &apos;t know about that .
possible contacts of this species are only relevant for the constitutional protection from a certain point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case the Af@@ D - changes its direction and becomes so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view to the significant increase in legitimate acts and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees , Ma@@ ined said he would not speak of new righ@@ tist terrorism in this context .
but in recent years we have found that there can be right @-@ wing terrorism .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
it may well be that other right @-@ wing groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
worried , Ma@@ ats expressed that many attacks went to the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene .
this is the wor@@ rying .

Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympi@@ ans or world records do not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bold performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer festivals in Rio de Janeiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight swi@@ mmer from Ethiopia so slowly that he was no longer able to see in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
after that , Hab@@ te became a viral agent in social networks .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a 48 @-@ second back@@ lash and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was not his straight athle@@ tic figure that attracted the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries better known .
since most sports@@ men run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of the W@@ hale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity @-@ tree &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only played with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters fre@@ estyle , played no role .
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete alone in a run over 100 meters fre@@ estyle .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was then fired at the time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim before the Olympics only eight months and had never had such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not look so close to the lo@@ oming election defeat
Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing to do with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump already has an alternative video .
he then enters the holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump is losing the U.S. presidential election in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately it will work either , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV station CN@@ BC .
if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , this is al@@ right , said Tr@@ ump .
so he called US President Barack Obama and the democr@@ ats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , there was always more and more opposition .
mail enters the trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is evi@@ dently great .
the mail plans to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
the Group will soon start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the post will also offer its electric transpor@@ ters on the free car market as of next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get into the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been examining for months whether they want to sell their own developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with which letters and packages are delivered , also to other farms .
post @-@ chairman Jürgen Ger@@ des had said that there are always questions , for example by craftsmen .
according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group will soon be entering the mass production of the vehicles .
in post @-@ production manufacturing , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ des announced that the Group was aiming to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and made a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles over the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we turn around the complete fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP leadership dec@@ lines after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the back@@ drops suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K fores@@ had@@ owed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will be all the more secure the longer the success promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the helm of the Nuremberg Market Research Group Gf@@ K : after renewed dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of corporate management , the global number Five of the industry is facing a new beginning .
GF@@ RP executive board wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K supervisory board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert already exp@@ ires from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
the management board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger already handed over the management board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger as of September 1st , announced the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; executive speaker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann is found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to mention a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
in the future , anyone who will manage the market research company is still unclear .
in investor circles it was said on Friday that the shareholders were at last the disappointment about the continued success of the restructuring initiated years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K summit since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , every shareholder will some@@ time become rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that were the case at BMW , that would make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company could not be able to stop its loss drive again in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , net sales were 6.1 percent below the comparable prior @-@ year quarter .
in relation to the first half of the year , sales fell by 3.4 percent to € 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million .
the profit in the second quarter largely imp@@ acted the decreased value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation .
the group amor@@ tization of EUR 139 million , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , reported a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million to the Group .
the Gf@@ K generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million in the second quarter of 2015 .
accidents - Bus dec@@ lines in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n in Gra@@ ben : eight injured
in the event of an accident of a touring coach with 43 senior citizens as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , divided the police .
according to her information , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to avoid her information , which was partly on the tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tory .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund noted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the passengers .
six Amb@@ ul@@ ances and a ambul@@ ance car arrived at the accident site on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ injured travelers were brought back from a regular bus back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a spare bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the trucks and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic metre of wastewater amount to 3,@@ 44 Euro for the sewage system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh@@ alling 3.@@ 44 instead of 2,@@ 10 Euro . for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( until now 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( until now 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the sewage treatment will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a rough calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , during the approval of the budget by the district council Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was found that underground structures were running for these sewage plants .
due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the systems in a cost @-@ covering manner .
as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sh@@ ochschule , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to dig deeper into the wal@@ let .
revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt presented to the committee , a new calculation of the fees for the sewage plants of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or overl@@ aps from the preceding calendar period shall also be equ@@ ated .
Schmidt founded the grave fee increases with the fact that all three wastewater installations were relatively small , with a very low wastewater down@@ fall , which lod@@ ged between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution basis for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three systems is slightly dec@@ lining .
furthermore , due to their age refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair expenses , all three systems have fallen in a considerable scope for all three installations .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sh@@ ochschule , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years old .
Schmidt explained that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the waste water plant in Az@@ endorf .
in the pumping station Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveying systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and the first sewage pond had to be removed after almost 20 years of operation , the sewage slu@@ dge was dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation option could be installed in order to comply with the water regulations .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses included the continued maintenance and maintenance costs that must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which have been significantly below the current level of the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the small sewage treatment in the three plants , the expenses for the operation and maintenance were &quot; fully penet@@ rated . &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt compl@@ ained that the market community of large entertainment costs have been spar@@ ed during the past 20 years .
the situation for the aforementioned facilities will continue to be prec@@ arious in the long run , as the supply of the Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal waste water utility company could not be extended because these facilities are defici@@ ent .
Bulgaria gets inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a rise in price was observed in the following groups of consumer goods : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure time and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) .
prices remained as in the pre @-@ month of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect is critici@@ zed as Asian carto@@ on
Snap@@ chat states that this filter anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filtering tool , it makes Snap@@ chat possible around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absurd .
you can transform into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are imm@@ aculate , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all mistakes are brought to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have cri@@ tiqu@@ ed critics in the past where they were accused that the app would promote Black@@ face or promote white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when this week struck a filter with a few users who gave them s@@ lit @-@ eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist carto@@ on of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wonder@@ ed if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat wed@@ ded that it would have turned off the feature .
the company ap@@ ologi@@ zed : the filter was intended as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism rec@@ alled the filter of hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Sav@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ ets were widely spread across the photos , wrote that the filter was &quot; inf@@ ring@@ ing and mil@@ dly uncomfortable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osition of a very reluc@@ tant Asian carto@@ on and the filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yellow face has been dra@@ gged into the dis@@ appearing extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling block .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in the hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates an image that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to remain un@@ noticed than it used to be , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay on media and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that ra@@ cial controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the large part white , only male leaders and ended their attachment with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either they have no representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chin@@ es@@ ich @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions in which they are safe or comfortable to say what about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely left the Snap@@ chat un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , it declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a personnel responsible , focusing on sub@@ mis@@ sive population groups and internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu also said she will keep her Snap@@ chat account closed and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership distorted IS@@ IS intelligence , re@@ poses Congress Committee
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a task force of the Republi@@ can members of the army committees , intelligence agencies and the draft budget committee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence information typically gen@@ dered by high @-@ level com@@ man@@ ders , regularly drew a more positive picture of the US efforts against terrorism as it would have permitted the actual conditions on the spot and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence agencies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , a Republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership mistakes in the Cent@@ Com are right up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training the Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct indications that government officials under Obama have given orders to change the reports , it shows how analysts counter the pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements before the congress were considerably more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com no@@ bl@@ eman announced publicly that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ m could start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , it &apos;s so clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of the Central Command changed intelligence reports to play down the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts took care of manipul@@ ating reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed findings while the investigation continues .
in addition , further investigation of the Cent@@ Com reports is under way by the Secretary General of the Department of Defense .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , which agree with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence services to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the highest ranking Democ@@ rat in the committee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s@@ wore the mor@@ als under analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little room for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of a White House intervention in the Cent@@ Com analysts regarding a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon general inspec@@ tor , who after complaints by Cent@@ Com were admitted .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon press spokesperson , in a statement that the Ministry of Defense did not comment on the congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor were still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the alleg@@ ations of last year have raised the question of what President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information on the Islamic State is remin@@ ding feu@@ d@@ alism of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush looked at the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker , according to government officials , stated that contrary to the government &apos;s declar@@ ations against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , there would have been no significant impact on the terrorist group &apos;s financial situation , as these temporary refin@@ eries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this recognition has not been published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ Com &apos;s then commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislative body because of his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
the United States win fourth match in women &apos;s field ho@@ ckey , a show@@ down with Great Britain is ahead
a day after having shot three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said that she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not one of the people who keep their doors in mind .
but she knows that : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , who remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which of the two teams from six teams will win the first and second place each .
the first placed will take the strong Dutch little longer out of the way to guide the other group .
whatever the game starts on Saturday , the American women have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex by their success story , four years after they landed at the last London games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time with three years wearing a ho@@ ckey ra@@ cket in her hands ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , at the age of 16 she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the 2008 Olympics because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the national team and thus began to turn things to a better one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have completely plu@@ cked the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the gate row in the first half of the game with a back @-@ hand stroke .
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed up surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
it completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved in the middle and loaded the ball into the gate to get the American female a 2 @-@ 0 guide .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the US go@@ al@@ keeper , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who so far had to book a goal in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we &apos;re in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
in the middle of the age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
Rio de Janeiro s events feel constantly and inevitably , a ra@@ ging relay between competition and striving .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick that is passed from the w@@ rist@@ band to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the gymn@@ ast for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s conversation in the waiting period in the coff@@ e@@ Shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , for the first time at the Olympic Games and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , could well have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even fen@@ c@@ ers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the centre , partly in the shadow there are the sports that are not generally accepted : pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it reign for a long time .
but if I would like to make a modest argument for my particular favourite , then let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete char@@ me of the trampoline .
although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it has been so spar@@ se noticed that many of the , I had asked , did not know that it is actually an Olympic port@@ art .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the US sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal on the trampoline and has had an ath@@ lete until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline has a certain out@@ sider charm , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ lown school than the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast .
it has a humor@@ ous potential - the kar@@ to@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of its never @-@ ending boun@@ ce - but also the grace of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that it essentially unites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jumping board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rising champi@@ ons jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to move a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ utation ) before they land on the feet .
they are evaluated according to official Olympic programme of execution , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ round athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts in their quest for gold need to go further , faster , up and down , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes up and down , up and down at the playground .
they hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall , but also in the TV transmission another ridi@@ culous goal : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ec@@ ond .
the goal oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator into tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel as ti@@ res@@ ome when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly upwards again .
here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wolf in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant ann@@ ul@@ ment of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can be .
the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; that of the men on Saturday , also at 13 : 00 .
N@@ BC will ex@@ ude the final rounds as part of a afternoon blo@@ c on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a calm , nice moment , one that is likely to be over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the an@@ gling and the obj@@ ection of male athletes , according to the Wall Street Journal , according to The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan community to arrive .
&quot; one generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is an ally of the US
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia met the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses alleged that during the clas@@ hes with the police , dozens of prot@@ esters were killed in shooting .
is Ethiopia right to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and spread to more and more areas .
last week thousands of people rus@@ hed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses testified that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
circul@@ ating videos on the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security men beat young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now asking for a detailed investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at an impressive pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued to supp@@ ress the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , whereby dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent to exile or imprisoned , killed or driven to the des@@ erts of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options apart from prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold over power of the ruling coalition .
after a widely critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament .
at the same time , tensions are rising along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a battle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which were forced more or less in recent years , could use the turbul@@ ence and be able to arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness are explo@@ ding after years of drinking in front of the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , because cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services have improved .
even if the government locks the access to Facebook and Twitter what it does at regular intervals , especially among protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians admitted that they gathered together as protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia predominantly Christian high @-@ countries , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this too is changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are there to coordinate under one umbrella , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray who account for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi &apos;s death .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was seen as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well @-@ vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of North Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia had witnessed such tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands protest against poll@@ s , apparently committed by the government and stolen from the government .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the past months and this period of ri@@ ots went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in fighting poverty .
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal ab@@ norm@@ ality of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ian city , attacked by Tig@@ ray and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests push the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighbouring Somalia , although it recently announced that it has closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declares his claim Obama had been founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump , on Friday , attempted to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication raises new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ cans &apos; presidential candidates whether he is able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
it also brings his comrades who endeav@@ or to take him in protection during an event@@ ful period , in the peculiar position to declare statements that he could not have meant at all .
after making the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump reli@@ ed on the alleg@@ ation on Thursday and insist@@ ed in interviews that he really did not intend to point out , the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was the opposite to the previous day Mr Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely serious .
when the conservative radio pres@@ enter Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can candidate wanted to know nothing about it .
the last storm of criticism boun@@ ces down to Mr. Tr@@ ump while trying to draw the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand values .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked to the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump again tried to return to this subject .
reporting on Twitter , he warned that Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their words boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians should h@@ ack Mr@@ s Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he said &quot; Of course I mean sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic borders in politics and then back up as needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans how they arrive and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction exp@@ ires . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even more appreci@@ ative note , as his return values have gone far@@ ther .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , published on Friday , showed a lead with a huge margin in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his hum@@ our .
but while he is in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps j@@ okes his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable position to stand to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ally his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , took great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps statements whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called her h@@ ind @-@ bro@@ ker , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream Republi@@ cans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as the Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread by attacking the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running around each of his words and being bi@@ ased against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats sne@@ ered at Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s ap@@ ology as just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once pushed over the price of the market , café returns to Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a nice café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where one could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices were pushed out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front .
the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie business , replacing the verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people ro@@ amed it as the last loss in a city of gent@@ ri@@ fying .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is a change , it &apos;s rein@@ vention as well .
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north from its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started to work at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide funds for a new branch , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu stand sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nis@@ hes such as cap@@ ers and sour onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club on a regular basis .
even after being moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path .
after the verb had closed she gave up a coffee r@@ ink for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was the coffee and culture in the verb I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before work and in@@ vari@@ ably appointed the same thing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came home to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he altern@@ ates his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no gru@@ dge about the fact that the soap business had taken the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for bre@@ wing with the cold @-@ bre@@ w@@ ed coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we &apos;re gon@@ na respond to her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he preferred to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice bar wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ w@@ ed coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a neighbouring building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as g@@ our@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue , such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was somewhat more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , mas@@ hed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Bri@@ ck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA , while brick is told in her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A decent meal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a repor@@ ter at the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , local snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive bits , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with potato pur@@ ée and vegetable mixes ate .
when the repor@@ ter ordered h@@ ack@@ y , this found the couple suitable for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Ziegel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper to reach the ingredient .
imagine to eat so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
cre@@ ws of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the ways with which the country was per@@ ishing , not to be the land of Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , focused topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious items such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ole was a &quot; wonderful way of re@@ plen@@ ishing food residue , &quot; bri@@ ck@@ ware noted , as chefs were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients from cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper des@@ ic@@ c@@ ots .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a seldom served luxury .
strange bl@@ ends have been tried out as a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious gr@@ ati@@ fication takes preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy food .
during their research for the book , which includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish from this period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was no popular addition to the lunch , &quot; Co@@ e says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bri@@ ck@@ ier continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions are not suitable for each other .
it was typical for many of the house recipes .
as never before , or ever since , budget econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - enjoyed the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keepers &quot; and the challenge of changing pamp@@ h@@ lets like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a festival of historical treats .
especially tasty are the reports of the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cakes @-@ food @-@ attitude .
while publicly pra@@ ising the simple I@@ owa peasant house cuisine of his cuisine , he served as the million@@ fold man of the world he has become .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental cuisine such as fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and wearing a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was deli@@ ght@@ fully un@@ realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt would perhaps have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to write an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the hired servant of a house@@ keeper with no interest in tastes from Mrs. Roos@@ ev@@ elt contributed to the fact that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food were dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country returned to their legs .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said brick , as well as on how science was applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of brick @-@ in @-@ law in writing the book - for example how they could not throw food away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; bri@@ ck@@ ier remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the incident of the wind .
after leaving the plate at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s premises , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , the president Roos@@ ev@@ elt would eat at lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man , adding that it was a common trick to give a modest recipe a nice name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ ved a bit reluc@@ t@@ antly to put a spoon in the t@@ ame , brown gli@@ b@@ bers .
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad .
Co@@ E won three times a surcharge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a civil defence group that , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved nearly 6@@ 0,000 people alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and to help in the war zone first aid .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civilian protecting him from the ruins of a house during a 11 hour rescue , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbolic figure in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he never saw himself as a hero , but said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I am dying to save lives , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have cast four barrel bombs above the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven men suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb so that no children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture quotes his final words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of Assad &apos;s regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ ral animal is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland sh@@ arks mostly come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board ship S@@ anna .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to date .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie only gets offspring with 150 years .
the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k flo@@ ats lei@@ surely along the North Atlantic Ocean , in an hour , it comes in average just 1,@@ 220 metres far .
only when it matters , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this long @-@ term lifestyle , however , seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case from a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k which could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist suspected long that Greenland would become stone @-@ old .
only the evidence lack@@ ed .
Greenland sh@@ arks are hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter at the surface .
researchers know little about the Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie &apos;s lifestyle .
they measured their time @-@ motion when they equipped six animals with a transmitter before Spitz@@ bergen .
still this sh@@ arks make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice sea and look for cad@@ a@@ vers that fall from higher water layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Green@@ lan@@ k@@ ha@@ ie who caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had a remarkable amount of carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ cular core .
its birth was therefore to lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons were carrying large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third @-@ smallest animal with 220 cm length , the lens nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons tests , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
in contrast , all larger Greenland sh@@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their lens nucle@@ us , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter @-@ long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with its 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res might even be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood on the threshold to the sexually mature and his age was determined at 156 years , Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication obviously allow for at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no coincidence that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ ems live mainly in icy waters .
also the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on at the neck was a 120 year old har@@ poon point , was caught before Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there frequently runs on spar@@ ring .
they then mature later - and age more slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as soon as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal should , on the other hand , invest their resources in a long life .
building site in double pack
in the recent meeting , the municipal council has focused on topics relating to construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the board accepted Mayor Robert P@@ utz said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of recently designated living areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the development , par@@ cel@@ ing and development issues have been clari@@ fied and the applications could be put to survey , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ straße - Construction Section 1 ) is no longer possible for interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au attract young families and older sen@@ iors alike .
as it was said , Bau@@ willing volunteers can now announce themselves in the Town Hall , discussing the allocation of the plots , the municipal council is expected to discuss in its September meeting .
in order to accommodate requests for the establishment of other industrial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan that was created in the spring of this year .
in the Unter@@ kir@@ lar@@ n area , the already designated industrial area will be extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
accordingly , the city in the Main has the best chances to attract jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the field of expertise in the financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether banks should continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport there is enough approval in the UK to date .
we are using big US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lob@@ b@@ ying association reck@@ ons with 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) is addressing the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Super@@ vision E@@ IO@@ PA and the ES@@ R .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry , but as well as Dublin , it is deterior@@ ating in terms of infrastructure .
thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
further points the city with easily available commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it &apos;s not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than in the Main .
furthermore , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime .
in a ranking of the corporate consultancy Merc@@ er , the city is ranked 7th , Luxemburg in place 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my econom@@ ists .
the balance of forces also speaks for this : according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead gets legal costs from hepatitis C patent disputes with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. Official Ju@@ dge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs resulting from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was liber@@ ated from a compensation install@@ ment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after an American judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct by Mer@@ ck , including per@@ verse and other un@@ ethical practices .
when the complaint was lod@@ ged on Thursday , US Secretary @-@ in @-@ law Beth Mar@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to reli@@ ance on the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ alize with Gilead which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can heal more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compl@@ ained and claimed ownership in laboratory work , including Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops backed by the US say they have reg@@ ained full control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
troops backed by the United States have taken full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left the city , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are comb@@ ing after the exo@@ dus of the remaining group of fighters who have been buried within the city , currently the city .
they have liber@@ ated over 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan informed Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council of Reu@@ ters , which was allied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we just carry out clean @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ ton earned 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton published their tax return on Friday , which resulted in the democr@@ ats of the Democrats and their husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated a USD 3 million income from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster &apos;s publisher for their book on their term in the State Department .
together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declar@@ ations for the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign assistant J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri reports in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hi@@ des behind false exc@@ uses and withdraw@@ als with regard to his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations , even though they are not oblig@@ ated to do so by law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign assistant Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s special advisor , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax inspections are not complete .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , including the Republi@@ can Pres@@ idential Candi@@ date of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already stated that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business models and various other connections , in particular with Russia .
Clinton has already top@@ pled the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump asks for his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke the subject also during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reported that during the 1990s , Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little tax , and a business journalist from the New York Times quoted a series of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday that this could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its seat , Tr@@ ump at a meeting to exchange their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax audit of the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax returns until 2007 .
on average , the Clinton &apos;s living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0,5 % .
the tax return of the 2015 Clin@@ tons showed that they only received USD 100 of their income as wage , unlike most Americans .
their main financial investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings were tax@@ ed from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , Fire@@ works Pro@@ mote Tanz@@ ani@@ as Ele@@ phant
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going settlements in humans - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ Guide Foundation , which already had the idea for years , has intensified its promotion together with the US Nature Conservation , by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops , without hur@@ ting animals .
before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the theme day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we have been able to observe a change in attitude within these communities , and they are more confident that they can hold the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first two steps include illumin@@ ating the elephant with a torch and blowing in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chil@@ ly cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together with a fire@@ work body , Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition switch .
when lit , the con@@ dom breaks up with a knob and spark@@ les fine dust of chi@@ li@@ pu@@ des in the air .
a breath is usually already out to ch@@ ase the elephant .
one last possibility is a th@@ row@@ er shooting a fire@@ work fire@@ works in the air and causing a loud , bright explosion .
city council unanim@@ ously appro@@ ves : no ki@@ osk on the banks of St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhine
normally the St. Go@@ ar@@ er &apos;s investment projects are taking place with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and - the retail trade in the city of Kern@@ stadt is still valid .
however , the city council now unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the new construction of a sales plan on the Rhine river in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine @-@ bel@@ lows located in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we welcome new tra@@ des@@ men , but this location in an exposed position on the Rhine shore doesn &apos;t fit this ki@@ osk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director breaks Berlin hotel because Israeli pre@@ election was removed after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media uprising after he revealed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin had not listed any Israeli choice , as Arab guests had requested &quot; according to one employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary Sho@@ ah , left his trouble at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the country &apos;s country list .
however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and extingu@@ ished ?
lance Lanz@@ mann wrote .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel from its own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as lance wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind this was more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election be deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were app@@ alled and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather large resonance on the Internet , in which people called it a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some subordin@@ ate to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yiel@@ ded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the supposed appeals of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it was said in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel which is situated on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm is near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly referred to all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; mistake &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel .
&quot; there has never been a direct order &quot; to not include Israel in the fast @-@ election list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police forces tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
on Thursday , students joined the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered to demonstrate against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , causing the police to put rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
according to the proposals of the governor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are being converted to save money .
some of the protest participants were seen gra@@ ff@@ ing against the provisional president , Michel Tem@@ er , on walls .
the latest protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended president , Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trading between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the turnover rate between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian companies on businesses in the country grew strongly , the ambassador said .
Russian companies take up existing relations with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade compo@@ unding between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trading post was achieved by supplies of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan comes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , the Russian deployment of around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , issued to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year are broken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d that have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .
looking for witnesses : inf@@ ecting drinks market in Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ ber@@ y fell on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL on the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ der Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
in the presence of a gun , three dark @-@ dressed persons , who had m@@ um@@ med up their faces , demanded the release of cash from the drink market and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver VW Golf .
how much money was captured , the police did not share .
the perpet@@ rators are supposed to have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 metres , i.e. relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible and badly visible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
after the raid , the perpet@@ rators must be run in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and from the gravel @-@ car park located opposite the car park entrance could be fle@@ ed with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who made observations at the time of the crime ( at 7 : 45 p.m. ) , which are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , must urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : fun and fun during the summer
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social educational day group / social group work of the Child Protection Society Nag@@ old with their car@@ ers during their summer leisure time in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
during the first week of school holidays , the life @-@ joyful group was quar@@ rel@@ ed in the quiet leisure centre .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , it went to B@@ rescue with the visit of the string zoo .
to the other after Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world famous monastery .
the third trip led to P@@ for@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited to jump , swim and pl@@ under .
children and car@@ et@@ akers with their own prepared body@@ boards like Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were spoiled culinary .
in workshops were made , beautiful jewelry made of beads and stones created or made of wood a Roman mill game .
other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Color@@ ful evening . &quot;
on the day of the voyage home the sun laugh@@ ed and the children and young people returned home satisfied .

together , four stages were dealt with .
in order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all the regi@@ stran@@ ts for two years , the senior minist@@ erial round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations were tested and finally decided for the Bishop &apos;s City of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , with the opening of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy on Fri@@ bourg cathedral , a special pilgrimage destination was offered .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and of Gru@@ ene , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the chambers of the sanctuary , went their way .
in the evening , pastor Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small ceremony in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ mage and par@@ ted the pilgri@@ m &apos;s blessing .
von Hor@@ b was taken by train to the starting point in Vil@@ lingen , where a Münster Un@@ es@@ er loved woman , and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started .
the individual tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and texts .
but also on the way , the min@@ is at field crosses , chap@@ els or churches made a break in order to sing a song from specially assembled pilgrims song booklet .
for the overnight stays the parish halls of the local par@@ ishes were available .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller took care of the stage targets for a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we went on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach on the second day .
on top of that , one entered the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting distance , but had to first desc@@ ended some 500 metres altitude and then be heard again .
the deser@@ ved reward was a barbecue at the Bad@@ ger in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the imposing church of St. Peter we went to Freiburg .
the min@@ is were visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy in the late afternoon at the Freiburg Min@@ ster and passed through the gates of mercy .
with a little impulse , God was given thanks .
Min@@ is by operator Markus Ober@@ t , arrived at the evening Mass in Münster , was welcomed in the evening mass in Münster .
after the divine service the pilgrims were able to visit the sacri@@ stry and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the Brei@@ s@@ gau metrop@@ ole .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
at the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor that his fellow coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made his own . the J@@ ump@@ y made the legend proudly when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from the favour@@ ites New Zealand .
four years ago , England claimed a shock@@ ing victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they only took sixth place in the London Under@@ ground World Championships in March , despite his res@@ ignation of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as exec@@ utions .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton were trying to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scot@@ s@@ man that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner placed an Olympic ord in the qualification rounds but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der lay just behind his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner considered it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , in which Hin@@ des went in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an Olympic ord in the final round and beat the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ du admitted that after a weak start , he intentionally fell off the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no acqu@@ itt@@ al of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ du said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags on the tri@@ b@@ une as London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we have come so badly with so many world@@ ly titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the cycle .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23rd ( a seemingly holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same as Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go for three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ him W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilometer race .
they arrived at the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the World Record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had argued with officers prior to the qualification yesterday when officials called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and ended tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on its strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a pair of med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
in April , the withdrawal of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director , Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s res@@ ignation in April in the midst of sex and bul@@ b@@ bing accus@@ ations , as well as the retirement of variables such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
but if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite like that the now legendary G@@ GB@@ s , who has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of the mel@@ t@@ down of Port@@ land due to the aboli@@ tion of energy production
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake , as the system operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus lift all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company wed@@ ded .
this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , not to grant any further subsidies to the operation of the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years runs out in November .
up to 2000 jobs at the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
no fewer than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melt consuming roughly 10 percent of total electricity generation Victori@@ as consum@@ es .
in 2014 Al@@ coa added the point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the sm@@ el@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land is losing money and ris@@ king a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , who supplies the large aluminium mel@@ t@@ down with his Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p hold smaller portions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L expects the plant to continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the AG@@ L continued to say that the Tre@@ aties were called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have come into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a period of 12 months , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L expects that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on the income to AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of the contracts already in its annual closing price of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a termination . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ ility Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not compromise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang in 2010 , which would have come into force from November this year , even if there is still an explanation as to why it has withdrawn from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt plant in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
referring to the analysts &quot; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses about 600 meg@@ a@@ watts per year and a total of around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity .
if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and it wouldn &apos;t be good for us as a generator , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a das@@ h of reality TV star , Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue
Leon J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , Model and the fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the U.S. Vo@@ gue .
Antonio , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ep@@ en Lau@@ der and ran to Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of the cover followed a bizarre ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hip &apos;s like ? ) , mirr@@ ored reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problems Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ bi@@ z unc@@ le and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , which ends with a classical twist : they all have a surprise party planned .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é plot nearly every birthday mass of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; , with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on on a broadcasting station at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an era began with certainty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken@@ do &apos;s big sister Kim may have struck her with the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the September edition is the most sold issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles rather an image book than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were on the 8@@ 32 pages of the roller 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover@@ star is so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still leak before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who mo@@ del &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar prize winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence spent 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the little chance that Mrs. J@@ en@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young@@ sters of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything applies to J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success is not everyone &apos;s success .
with her reality TV history J@@ enn@@ ers has always been a bit ten@@ se in the fashion world .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called them &quot; the mist@@ let@@ oe of the moment . &quot;
these feelings boiled up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but craw@@ ling around on the m@@ ess seems to pass by the point .
Leon J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of Vo@@ gue .
it is super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ep@@ y Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters are selling pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine W@@ TV .
and in her free time she is in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal centers boast about 16@@ 0,000 people each year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s emergency figures are rejected every year by the municipal centers , while the industry is preparing for the impact of further mid @-@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly elderly people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those with no means for un@@ just del@@ u@@ sions and similar - are rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already busy at full capacity , are ready for further cuts .
from June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their funding .
the Director of the Community Cultural Centr@@ es in Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of municipal centers revealed that thousands of people had already been rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only get worse without the Federal Government &apos;s resolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people are rejected of important services you need , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relations , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dis@@ missed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dis@@ missed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
the Federal Government will cut funding by 30 percent as of June 2017 , which means thousands of people in need from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the General Prosecutor and Justice Minister and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the state government met its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their customers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump El@@ ection Camp@@ aig@@ n accused after employee allegedly drew weapon
new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign has been charged because of alleged in@@ activity after you &apos;ve been told that in February , your campaign manager for North Carolina did a fire@@ arm on a staff while they were on a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed by Vincent B@@ ord@@ i on Wednesday in the Local Court of Charlotte , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ordin@@ i had been waiting for months to have waited for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign manager , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drew a pist@@ ol , put his right finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the barrel in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ fe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ord@@ i announced in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when he compl@@ ained to the local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted to the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons do not have to be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ord@@ i announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the indictment comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate spark@@ ed a ri@@ ot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judge .
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign made it clear that the media had torn its words out of context and that it would not inc@@ ite violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordin@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of duty of care and Philip for bodily injury and lasting emotional damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps press spokesperson Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a comment .
attempts to contact Philip failed as well .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , announces that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign .
calls from his consulting company , Innovative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .
Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has so far been campaig@@ ning for a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey of Coun@@ tries @-@ Elec@@ tions : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses for the SPD and CD@@ U ruling parties are apparent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this resulted in representative surveys by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition could not continue to go@@ vern in the North , this is not possible after the survey figures in Berlin .
but in both states the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing to head the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent , five years ago .
according to the survey , the party was only margin@@ ally ahead of the CD@@ U , which could return to 23 percent again .
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would be 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the Parliament &apos;s parliament .
despite moderate losses , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ itated again to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag with 6 per cent ( before 8.@@ 7 per cent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the Parliament with 3 per cent each .
according to the survey , the SPD in the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties would only be 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
this leaves the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ates would not miss the move in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : the Nokia Communic@@ ator came on the market 20 years ago .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his maker experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed nearly half kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand either .
on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory initially amounted to eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would suff@@ ice today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabyte .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euros , fans can still buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , however , Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in the west pocket format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , the new mobile phone could be a lot for those standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , al@@ beit slowly slow .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
quite proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , thus about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could guess in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the mobile phone line of Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold and handled by Microsoft .
today , vendors know the market all much later than Nokia .
to be online anytime and anywhere , that is today for a lot of people &apos;s everyday lives .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
some 1.4 billion units were sold , on Samsung and Apple alone , 5@@ 55 million units were sold .
worldwide turnover with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and the t@@ elec@@ om companies .
a whole industry has now emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on Mac @-@ World .
he promised three instruments in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator to easily operate everything via touch screen .
the trium@@ ph@@ al march of Apple began , even today , the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry who dominated the market had the night vision .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ wing now has Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his cell phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens executive board responsible for personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London , when we used a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we will already create 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ amed on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked to him .
like the Olympics , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in spir@@ ited growth and bequ@@ e@@ ath@@ ed a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and the whole of the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , who has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to the T2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks .
now they are ready to provide a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to ste@@ er this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row and secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and occupation that England can be proud of .

on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ages on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post in which it informed that users could update their filters in the program to again block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop site would change the coding for its advertisements to make it difficult to detect the recognition of which part of the page advertising is .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of keeping and f@@ elling between the open source community and the b@@ yp@@ asses has been underway since the invention of indicator block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has joined battle is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying scor@@ ing block@@ ers have become the industry .
worldwide , according to a study of the last year of Pa@@ w@@ air and Adobe , employ around 200 million people scor@@ ing block@@ ers ; almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users , who access their mobile devices on Facebook , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenues .
the company has said it to ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a speaker .
advertisement on the desktop PC makes a sufficient amount of revenue generated so that Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad preference pool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control of their targeted advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blocks would be disturbing new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced a Facebook spokes@@ man in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we focused instead on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into people &apos;s hands .
woman with presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss motorway crossing
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the motorway .
the police call on witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident took place on the A1 in the vicinity of Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss woman , at the age of 49 , who was attacked by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill herself .
she died on site .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police , who calls on these as well as any witnesses of the incident to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared with Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a clas@@ h avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hof@@ st@@ etter said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not responsible .
in each of the two cases - in which a person in the dark ran on the motorway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walk@@ way in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent hom@@ icide after having crossed and killed a man who lay in August 2014 one night on the A1 in the vicinity of Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and had become unconscious on the street , deser@@ ted the court .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who had replied to a call -- drove to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably inhab@@ itable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ tight atmosphere could once have experienced similar conditions .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere and yet slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably referred to more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to house life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus shows its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus , similar to evolution , which was previously thought by planetary researchers .
although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus -- over the course of several billions years --@@ was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans were evapor@@ ating and their steam was burned away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen escaped just a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide having a mortal greenhouse effect left -- the Venus , which as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy steps back as trainer of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy returned on Thursday as a trainer and vice president of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to a small contribution right to the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of Hock@@ ey Operations at the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement .
during the summer , I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , needed and bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick today informed me about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sak@@ ic said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he did for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the Best Coach of the League during his debut season with the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award .
he led the club to 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was hit in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the last two years the low season .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches featured a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and dropped behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers engage in talks again , strike out strikes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour disputes regarding the remuneration for North Sea oil workers will be suspended , while all the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will sit at the table for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the Wood Group oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adic@@ ally carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current strike , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold a few full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , beginning next year to restart the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood Group has reduced rates to its tractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent reduction for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts will give the company the space needed to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released thousands of people for its part and plans to give up its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British utility BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that has reinforced the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest jobs in the North Sea since one generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion of new projects in the North Sea are expected in the North Sea in comparison to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest Mission with Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to gather the complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers to understand why stars rotate in the star cluster to different rates , and in what context the rotation periods are associated with the formation of the planet .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star loops , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age , and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star @-@ name of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years distant from the earth .
many stars in this star cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
they are making themselves the quick@@ est now .
to peak rot@@ ational rates , these mature stars rep@@ el large amounts of star@@ ches .
since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star is aging its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearing of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalog of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars of slow pi@@ rou@@ ettes rotate as smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more mas@@ sively , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
as the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare the stell@@ ar qualities as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still much to tell us about how , how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in three newspaper reports detail@@ ing their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star will kick off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of base to base .
after his emotional response , the 41 year old pro will wear the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos; to both , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game atten@@ dee of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez became the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has provided him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will in future act as a consultant and youth coach - with a full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame Members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is unlikely to be admitted to the resting hall of the bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was successful in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; admitted to having banned ster@@ oids from 2001 to 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was closed for 211 games by the end of 2014 due to a involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect to have been receiving funding from an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida for years .
after a dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; I even enjoyed the league for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said sweet@@ ly at that time .
also his f@@ arewell @-@ days are not going sil@@ ently .
while many bas@@ eball legends hold the big stage again in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job includes trying to win every game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to Cameron Di@@ az and the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , received sympathy from the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the supporters at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : due to a positive dop@@ ing test , Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland will not be allowed to start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
an experienced ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle @-@ runner Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested thoroughly in Brazil and excluded - immediately prior to the beginning of the already cri@@ tically poll@@ inated athle@@ tics competitions , these news are coming to an end .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de has already been proven last Sunday which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Court of Sports CA@@ S confirmed their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ flies , only 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en should have taken part in the courses over 50 m fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B test and a hearing .
the national association takes the matter very seriously and demands full co @-@ operation with the investigations , &quot; X@@ in@@ hua quoted from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Court of Sports CA@@ S and will accept the judgement . &quot;
for the first time in history it is not the IO@@ C but the CA@@ S responsible for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases .
also during the night of Rio the news le@@ aked through the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation might be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the ath@@ lete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O should act in the forbidden substance .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B test should have already been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported criticism to the ath@@ lete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
on Friday , also known as &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class of up to 85 kg was also tested positive for the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon for three days .
both deny the intake , however , both must not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the athletes &apos; start , especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Association IA@@ AF was banned from the entire Russian team except for the exception of systematic dop@@ ing , and even the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya has produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in addition , the former tre@@ aties in China had also taken care of violent clas@@ hes between the athletes .
for instance , the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium above 200 m fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focus of a debate with Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun had been positive for the Chinese Championships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to wait for a three @-@ month lock@@ out .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail her ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ mail @-@ malware are currently targeted at targeted companies - and they are successful .
according to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes at 540 companies in North America , UK and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months have been subjected at least once , sometimes several times victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som fees demanded by the perpet@@ rators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again .
the perpet@@ rators , according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , speci@@ alize in attacks on company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially potentially black@@ out ran@@ som is much higher than with private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most of the painting programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was sc@@ ary in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on the computer of an victim , it searches for recently modified files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als in a sustainable way .
subsequently , the software presents the demands of the press .
to get the final key code to the files , the victims have to transfer money - mostly in the form of Bit@@ coin &apos;s cryp@@ to@@ currency .
but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without ce@@ asing production .
the damage is correspon@@ dingly higher if a ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported loss of revenue by ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely inter@@ rupt the business operation , in one case , people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals had already been victims of attacks , whose patients may be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only encourage the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies paying , get their data back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for managers it is difficult to reject the perpet@@ rators &quot; demand in the face of down@@ time in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers , in turn , know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers from F @-@ Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to earn more money .
they explain to their victims via chat , as they can pay per Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support websites or dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t free sample files .
and if private individuals are redeemed after payment of a few hundred euros , companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to retrieve their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively low risk gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more and more professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the anti @-@ virus supplier Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware around within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that it is about three or four people .
the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software block to the actual ex@@ tor@@ ates .
the so @-@ called malware kits have been created using malware itself , consulting , and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included in delivery is an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ex@@ tor@@ tion@@ ists then seek further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
so one logs in one of the boards underground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and commis@@ sions another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is per certified computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , criminals assign sp@@ amm@@ ers to spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey rely on file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software to be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful exhaus@@ tion , the offen@@ ders rather thre@@ aten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declares Malm@@ sten CEO Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the damage potential is much higher than before , depending on the type of data .
in future , the perpet@@ rators will also be able to take up entirely new targets on the internet of things .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz , Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the internet under their control .
in the middle of winter the activation of such a block@@ aded heating could well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ rators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the little HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds pretty much over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear , it does not work in any place .
the materials of the interior are well finished and work comfortably , only the upper side of the cockpit collap@@ ses .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles when it comes to storage space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l@@ bs on high @-@ level and 10@@ 26 l with inver@@ ted back@@ rests , but the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like chin chairs and thus offer storage space that is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor up to ceiling .
the boot is well loaded , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he should do his job somewhat more quietly .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another mechan@@ ization : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety systems include the City Emer@@ gency Bra@@ ke Ass@@ ist ( working at speeds 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision war@@ ner sometimes conf@@ uses because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long @-@ beam assistant is very reliable .
and the intelligent template respon@@ ds to the traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if necessary .
however , full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation navigation , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI j@@ acks are below the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to reach .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel is fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with Euro 6 emission standards .

airline is not liable : down@@ fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the crash of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only conceivable if there are dangers which are typical for aviation .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee injury during the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
case of illness : when the organizer pays
after their trip , ill holi@@ day@@ makers only get money back if the cause of the disease can be found in the hotel without a doubt .
this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven the same symptoms .
in the case of the case , a family was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their door@@ step .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness brought back the holi@@ day@@ makers to a defective wastewater treatment plant , which allegedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family thought that the trip was thus lacking - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
indeed , the sewage treatment plant was in fact defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned shortly before departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then , he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the judgment .
particularly since no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of water .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion with each other - belongs to the general risk of life .
out of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
after the violence committed by refugees in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be pru@@ dent and determined at the same time to act on terror threats .
for sure , our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hate and split .
we will not grant this triumph to the terrorists .
if offen@@ ders had to leave the country more quickly , however , this would increase the security and strength of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to reach a realization of the proposals until the 2017 German Bundestag election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced further personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the four @-@ digit size over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism ought to be punished again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
video surveillance needs to be improved , the right to be amended so amended that , above all , the purchase of weapons in the Internet is ham@@ pered .
the last much discussed duty of confidentiality for physicians is to remain in accordance with de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , as the threat of citizens could be reduced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with a look at psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act radic@@ alisation of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ sed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the deployment of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD leader Gabriel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the interior minister spoke clearly against action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ pp@@ ets in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel told the papers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of dual nationality .
it is not constitu@@ tionally problematic for a general prohibition of full veil .
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
talk about rules for example in road traffic or for witnesses to court .
green @-@ chief Sim@@ one Peter repro@@ ached the Minister that he wanted to simulate with ever new anti @-@ terrorist act , action and action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet sc@@ ars and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay do not bring people to safety in this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better flow of traffic on the free@@ way br@@ inger
it st@@ alls regularly on the b@@ ypass - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the right @-@ wing ambi@@ ance should be extended .
this is a good news for all the car drivers who are driving in traffic on the ambient road every evening when they drive on the highway for Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction will be extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Street and the Wes@@ er Straße , the right @-@ hand lane lane by 700 meters .
drivers can then thread directly from the Hammer street on the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is getting faster , which improves the overall sequence of operations on the busy section of the federal road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Mu@@ enster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder boo@@ sts drivers mainly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the way back to the bridge across the Alber@@ slo@@ h way and sometimes beyond .
the reason is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Street .
from here , traffic is only left lane @-@ track via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be disman@@ tled well in three @-@ four@@ ths years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to absorb the heavy load traffic two @-@ lane .
as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated factory @-@ day traffic jam pers@@ ist , the competent national firm cannot say .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : the bridge has an official remaining period of use up to the year 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal regulation of the law , the country has deliberately chosen the traffic @-@ weaker time during the school holidays because of the impair@@ ment of disability .
traffic will be tra@@ cked at the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural Activities for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the boy theatre are now planning a musical project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young@@ sters with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule children &apos;s home has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Youth Theater in Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students between 11 and 15 years visited the production in the Small House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most of the young people in the class were from September 2015 to March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , according to the press release of the Junge Theatre Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ chen@@ hold , and the Junge Theatre will work together in the upcoming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without refugee and migrant backgrounds will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical language teaching are in planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; goes on .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement in weather
the weather made the shooting star Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany a das@@ h through the bill last night - but there is still hope .
the night was poorly suited for clouds and rain to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the Chairman of the Astronom@@ ical Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
the star@@ bases are per@@ sei@@ ds , which are among the fastest shooting stars at 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the northeast .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening you roll around etern@@ ally , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning it is already far ahead of the wake @-@ up ring no more to think of sleep .
this is everything else than relaxing .
after all , with such problems in good society : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of the adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not rest@@ ful .
what are sleeping problems or sleeping disorders ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there are many causes underlying them , emphasizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society of Sle@@ eping Beauty and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what you see for the time being , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , so an in@@ let and diar@@ rhe@@ a disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falling asleep readily feels many people as un@@ satisfactory or inadequate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , member of the board member of the German Medical Association with practice in Var@@ el , Lower Saxony . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this can be organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines .
not in@@ frequently , sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is common in case of depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors require each other .
for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie badly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly begins to hail about everyday problems and worries , breathing out an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleeping disorders be recommended ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month or at least three nights a week should go to the doctor .
the impair@@ ment can look very different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or headache .
in order to allevi@@ ate the problem of sleep , it is important to find out their causes .
among other things , treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
relaxed sleeping medicine hardly exists in Germany , emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Research Centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , in case of sleep problems , one should first contact the family doctor .
this can be clari@@ fied by investigations if the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep and what will happen ?
for example , doctors advise doctors in the sleeping laboratory for snor@@ ing with breathing drop@@ outs , abnormal wear@@ iness of the day , sleep trans@@ duc@@ ers or if you do not find the cause of a sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , says Fi@@ etze .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please don &apos;t make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after cal@@ ab@@ ling you go to bed for a normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ go@@ ggles , a chest strap and a anten@@ na@@ e on the finger .
in addition , a camera records the sleeping ends at the ceiling .
how can people get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep .
sho@@ ebo@@ x counts : regular sleep and stand @-@ up times , not too long in bed , don &apos;t sleep on the day , do not watch TV to sleep , avoid alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is absolutely not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp has with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has commented on the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is via Facebook .
in December 2014 he took gold for the first time in Doh@@ a &apos;s brief world championships and at the same time exhibited his first world record .
the former DS@@ V ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has now protected himself against his ex @-@ team@@ mates in the critic@@ isms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives € 20,000 bonus and a jungle King pays 15@@ 0,000 € , nobody should wonder about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on his Facebook page on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transport system in the swimming sport is bad , but the dop@@ ing controls are very good .
in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look closely at the subject of dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ f would have had to report nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how it should be maintained with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who cannot control WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; independent controllers of the World Cup / OS must not take part &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the El@@ ection Hamburger , who now runs an ice cream shop . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de arrested by Bag@@ gage Check
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday , the civil servants of the Düsseldorf police managed the arrest of two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61 .
the susp@@ ects had committed several bags of pocket and luggage as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 , civilian officials in the area of the Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang that was known to polic@@ emen from past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July of this year and went on a joint , labour @-@ intensive and particularly professional manner .
the specialists of the criminal commission@@ er 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thi@@ eves , which had been specially prepared for the off@@ ence of criminal off@@ ences .
in total , they exploited more than 15,000 Euro .
old buildings , some lin@@ den trees , in between a remnant of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not look like this , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the road from east to west , one passes play@@ grounds , a fres@@ her kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone spra@@ yed at the facade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite of a Li@@ dl , which is to be demoli@@ shed soon , it is already built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; articles about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain calls , however , are preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the Berlin interior sen@@ ator Henkel has been dealing with the police against the project several times since the beginning of the year , describing the area as a &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after ev@@ acu@@ ating the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers on June 22 , the police pat@@ rolled official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
in the meantime , construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal and a day later police and construction workers under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ i@@ zers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain vor@@ m late .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects lie a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left @-@ hand violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the neighbourhood since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who here cat@@ ches three children here , is particularly anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , which predominantly demanded police protection from the vac@@ ant left .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police set up between land@@ lords and their neighbours , obviously does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class quarter , which also today compared to the rest of the city a low average income and a high risk of poverty .
home occup@@ ations and the born living projects have long been part of the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , among them almost the entire Main@@ zer Straße in the vicinity of the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer was swe@@ pt under great police force in a real street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the district has become increasingly mag@@ nets for tourists and election @-@ Berlin@@ ers from all over the world : with them , residents of GDR times and former home occup@@ ants are now sharing their neighbourhood .
this is reflected in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them from win@@ ded pan@@ es or freshly painted facades , which were e@@ ject with color @-@ bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason why not all neighbours consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body injury are based on statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the criminal off@@ ences cause damage , which tend to meet the new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a ten@@ ant house next to the controversial 94 , there can be no question of uncertainty .
as for violent acts , it is important : the 94 people are their neighbors , they were certainly not .
even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the R@@ ī@@ ga .
for the architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here you can help each other , live together on the street and get more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deliberately drawn into the street of Riga - and has remained .
that &apos;s why it was so important to it that the local residents got their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which all of a sudden claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district in July .
but in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road is still taken away from them : by fac@@ eless new buildings in former mos@@ quit@@ oes that are displac@@ ing the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , these are con@@ dos which are not interesting for many - rather people who are not so well @-@ searched , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely cannot appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what do you have to do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for drawn @-@ out , who anno@@ y him about color bombs : the house projects and the left @-@ wing scene were part of the &quot; Kie@@ z . &quot;
those who come here should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub area , can complain bad about noise .
all persons presented only with first names have asked them not to be named with their correct name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee promot@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social educ@@ ator supports the management team around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact person for all stakeholders : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine client from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is here now , the so@@ othing wool mel@@ low , which has a problem above all .
thus some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ously , rather than target the multitude of desired tasks - meant when the administration wanted to write the job .
looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , an en@@ viable Woll@@ mat@@ ch@@ sau .
but managing work is not her central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le writes .
above all , it concerns organisation , work with people on site and behind the scenes as well as network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent job on a term of three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports hon@@ e- and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
new containers will soon be station@@ ed in Was@@ en@@ straße
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a serious problem has been for some time finding apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local authorities are responsible for the connection .
they need to accommodate the refugees in their own or hired living rooms .
the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Land &apos;s Office to the Commune and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
it does not work so far , unless you depend on private residen@@ ces , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , community apartments must be so@@ ber@@ ed as it is so beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so soon new containers will be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , training centres , one @-@ euro @-@ jobs and temporary employment for refugees and migrants who need to be found or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help master craftsmen , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not mean only work .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people should develop a sense of belonging .
so I need offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here too , administration and volunteers are jumping .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they have to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses .
those who develop the feeling that in Ur@@ bach can &apos;t help anyone , don &apos;t work and be useless who will never be able to integrate .
the clear majority was motivated .
but there are problems too , customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people with whom nothing works . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always motiv@@ ating others .
all this is a mamm@@ oth task .
a difficult question : do the two have fear of radic@@ alisation after recent events , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ ve might call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents are also a topic among the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins were completely retri@@ eved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
therefore , the main and volunteers must look for activities in the region and in the region .
they always have in the background that soon there could be a new push for refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly , the policy is h@@ ein@@ ous .
actually it is unfair to spot them on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ bacher has already been utilized to properly integrate the existing people .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : burg@@ lar@@ s looking for helicop@@ ters
