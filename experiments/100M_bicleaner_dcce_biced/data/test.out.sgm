<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer was looking for a little change with some colleagues on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.</seg>

<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany's best golfer of all times - 101 tournament wins - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was guided with his family about the layout of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even hover for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was the first time in Aachen and therefore also with the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German online help handed the man from Anhausen in the course of a small gala the golden sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">The likeable athlete does not have any awards.</seg>
<seg id="16">Federal Cross of Merit, Silver Laurel leaf, Champions tour-player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already adailed him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps Economic Policy Compared: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade deal TTP - both Clinton and Trump want to prevent.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "however, the two U.S. presidents are not one of the tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental question." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate it, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively go back to regulation and he is campaigning for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Clinton said:" "" "the state has to fulfill certain tasks, it has to open some disadvantaged opportunities and needs money." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the meantime, Trump and Clinton need to be invested almost verbally.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicant is even announcing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump there could be party-internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas, he plans to terminate the Paris climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton, on the other hand, intends to specifically expand renewable energy with its investment program:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in terms of infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transcendental trade agreement, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but rather to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "they should also be paid better," "" "says Clinton." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be rinsed, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is probably more likely to develop the tax policies of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump is standing, which wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics claim that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to ask the rich to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every fledged woman has experiences with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence is almost a part of everyday life for women who are fleeing themselves.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby with a maximum of one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in her arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the tabletop.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is being watched.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles briefly and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one talks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the area manager of Condrobs, a supporter of social services in Bavaria, and deals with women on the run, among other things.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are refugees.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs has set up the institution together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has recently been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - either not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape," "" "says Bahr." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them as hope for Europe," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "women outweigh other reasons for the escape:" "" "many steal away secretly, because they don't see any other way out." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland they have experienced experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honours, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is what drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run this goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "for example, that tugs demand sexual action for a bottle of water is not a rarity," "" "says Bahr." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Whoever believes that as soon as they arrived in Germany, erre, tells Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even here, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and abused at worst.</seg>
<seg id="32">This means that approximately 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, they appreciate.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "some of the children are certainly not volunteer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are used to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "or they don't dare to talk openly about what they experienced, because the shame is too big." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often don't know how to help, I need more accommodations just for them, says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answers with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodations.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Swabia alone, fleeing women are not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia there are floors or own houses in some common shelters and their own houses only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations only for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "the committee" "" "Women's Rights and Gender Equality" "" "also calls for women to be separated from men separately." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistance physicians have called on their union to approve new labour struggle measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more work-fighting measures from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC stated that ministers would have agreed to address the concerns regarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">In July, resident doctors and medical students have agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in favour of the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the members released on Twitter on Thursday evening, the President of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would have remained "persistently quiet" to problems, leading to the rejection of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "In light of this, the JDC Board agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and request official new negotiations for all your concerns." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Executive Board today filed a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve an ongoing program of escalating activities commencing at the beginning of September.</seg>

<seg id="11">The director of the BMA assistant physicians Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms of contract recommended by the BMA.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and proclaim an official end to the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish back-player in the gold-gilded hall of St. Petersburg's palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed to be very dirty and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report a whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but can even improve." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper said that Erdogan had behaved as if there had never been anything bad.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's glowing, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had not forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at that time was angry.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin announced and accuses Ankara to have fallen back on Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The decline was even greater, as it was committed by an alleged boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building up the veto becomes difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state controlled media made a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria's areas, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire lie clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was removed from his office during a failed coup d "état last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal onslaught to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week the State television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemos formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists are long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West as it regards its response to the attempted takeover as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "in addition, the persistent resentment on the snail pace of EU accession talks and Putin - who is eager to take advantage of the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state gained a bonus in Ankara that after the attempted coup d "état, he called for support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a profound fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace on the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to represent an "alliance of outsiders" as an analyst once described: two countries that feel alienated from the West and feel bad and now unite.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played a role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents have said at the press conference that they had not even stripped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question of their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin moisturises Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin recently dismissed Sergei Ivanov's Chief of Staff.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV has been part of Putin's closest intimate circle for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed as a special representative for environmental and transport issues.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it is said that Putin has ordered" "" "the discharge of Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration without giving reasons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was a deputy since 2012, was named his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is said (in Russian) that later he was the head of the head of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the government's most important task to support your activity as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">For a long time, Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest confidant Vladimir Putin and works as he did for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin on television broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned upon his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was touted as a potential president should at one time lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin cited on the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov said, "It is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to give me this very complicated post - one could almost say - to entrust this post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the State Security Service (KGB).</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced KGB, Ivanov was named his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia, as Putin's third term in office had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close ally to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The project budget of £1.35 billion is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensland ferry crossings with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closing of the" "" "ceiling blowers" "", "approaching each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 bevelled ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The project of £1.35 billion is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economics, Keith Brown visited the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queensland crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witness to an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used for this part of the bridge alone.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate work requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck is given a gong for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted up to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing bridge Constructors, said: "the first closure is a significant milestone in each bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">With this fantastic project, the closure is future-proof construction and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north turmdeck being expanded, we then had to close the existing gap on the north or shore.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very hot activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, because the Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs approx. 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx. 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate because the tolerances on which the team were working were tiny - on each side they were just a few millimetres.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "the SPD and the Greens are saying," "" "Investors are to be put more strongly into duty in the future." ""</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "the SPD suggests a" "" "room for action" "" "at the next meeting." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But argument is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said S & D Group president Christoph Bratmann:" "" "we agree with the Greens: if you want to build on urban areas, you will have to pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the cheap apartments can also be built on stock.</seg>
<seg id="10">The big issue in the town hall is, however, as viola: "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing development programme that will cost millions and still has to be financed shall ensure incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem, so Bratmann:" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants to be tightened for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of this, as Bratmann, there is a tightening of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action plan is implemented, this will take care of additional tasks in the building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is still not complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does one balance the loss of more than 1,300 cheap apartments, whose funding will expire in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, should now be purchased outlining bonds from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be considered to bring apartments back to the price binding again.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in Weststadt.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem could be solved in one fell swoop.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the Weststadt there are periods of time at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments can be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this does not want the owners, the housing companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased, it is removed from the objective of so-called mixing.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no concentration of socially disadvantaged in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect there to be still movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "said Group president Holger Herlitschke:" "" "the CDU must be in the boat for a broad majority." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It's fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children don't go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens has been deplored by many over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to TV, then on video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that outdoor technology and outdoor activities don't mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I am referring to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on characters created initially for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, the interest before the release of the game decreased in the US, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand overburdened by the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, "captured" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the boat and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" "" "average" "" "person restores each day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, tracking 35,000 users, informed the Washington Post recently that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of followed people, who exercise every day 30 minutes, leapt from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to bring about" "" "take 30 minutes" "" "to" "" "come from the sofa" "" "and" "" "get active every day" "" "because many public messages for health are boring and come from people who look appealing." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also grumpy playdespeople who have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could already trace our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will decrease over time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemons's success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active will in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortlessly on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant all along the line.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast came to a multi-battle title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight on the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their total score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medalists and "Final Five" team mates Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medallist Aliya Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles contests on the Swedish beam during the solo multi-campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-fight title and overall the fifth, while she maintains her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey was ending at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years of its sport, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lou Reson said she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the singular multi-campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles won the first medal on Tuesday while she served as exclamation mark at the graduation ceremony of the team coordinator, Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted, during their long journey to the top, never planned the future, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - containing their typical barbel pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would suit home on the street outside the Olympiaarena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a little child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion in the gymnasium, was exercised in the Boorman.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has lost no more competition, a series of victories that will last as long as Biles wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafa was easily led by two turns, the picture blew up.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedish beam and floor gymnastics - in which Biles holds the title of the world - lurking.</seg>
<seg id="28">She regained again with 15,433 on the Swedish beam - and sat down on the ground with a 15,933 on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently as she expected her final - a pure formality - and tears flowed on fine glossy red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a tiebrake went to Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team capitol, called the American "Oma," had a head start.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her adversity she threw Kusshausen into the audience, overpowered by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-old has a very new meaning since the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>

<seg id="10">The investigators refused to reveal the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.</seg>

<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heavy rains and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to call for the emergency on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in the south-east Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi River flooded their banks and threatened with large flooding after extreme rainfalls, the National Weather Service reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards had announced that the state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already underway to help the communities in question.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, announced that the requests for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags increased.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa would have requested ten thousand sandbags.</seg>
<seg id="7">A flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Louisiana to Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service decreed that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9">A flood warning system was deployed in the south of Alabama on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The river Comite close to Baton Rouges and the River Amite close to Denham Springs, both of which are located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the suburds near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that a downstream inundation in Ascension Parish is a threat, as these rivers will only flow slowly into Lake Maurepas over the rivers that have occurred.</seg>
<seg id="13">The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level on Friday at 09.00, which was ever recorded.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescue teams always abused people from flooding in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in the Southwest of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were rescued from Globe on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose steeply over night.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that another boot-son who lives near him would have warned him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "we woke up and the water flowed in and poured in," "" "said Hansford." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said that emergency surfers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Globe, where they were accommodated until Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Krautmann said that the flooding had" "" "spread quickly" "", "as there were still heavy rainfalls and that the authorities considered evacuation directives." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann, an observer came close to Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the soil was significantly sucked in due to rainfalls since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities stated that heavy rainfalls and street flooding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and teaching workers in five districts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The CBS subsidiary WWII reported that an assistant in Tangipahoa attacked 200 inundated houses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, both flooded.</seg>
<seg id="29">The leader of the Municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets washed by floods.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to house the evacuation.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "once the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">In the town of Hammond, the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozens of roads were closed due to the high water and provided sand bags for the residents to take part, hoping to be able to keep the water out of their houses and shops.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "the last major flood we had was in March," "" "said Lacy Landrum of the city administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">This seems to be a similar incident.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Mississippi, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison Countys said that it was raining on the Gulf Coast.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to his information, a handful of houses were reported to have been flooded on Thursday, but no reported on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="37">Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I present myself under the Women's olympiamanness in gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, since 1984 I have been at each summer Olympics, and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this crew has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, inspiring for many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew and Madison Kocian, who is Catholics, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-Americans.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas celebrated a surprising Olympic champion and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world championships in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected but masterful gymnastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American, who won gold in an individual combined event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we don't see gymnastics in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same path as Aly and Madison in order to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the Last Five, because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics are an expensive sport and gymnasts come first and foremost in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents, who pay for training, arranging, travel and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these clubs are in affluent suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the Turner receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes, since they started the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to give the congregations aun countless, young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and accessible gymnastics training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my Turnstiftung for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events, we have offered free and affordable Turns in Harlem for over 15,000 urban teenagers (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international champions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth of high-quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong advantages for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, which brings thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic team golds and thank you for motivating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37.000 assistance doctors who voted in favour of a vote rejected it.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "in July Hunt had revealed plans to forcibly introduce the contract and said that the NHS could be found in a" "" "man's land" "" "and that any further delay would be harmful for the employees and patients." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "the first assistants should receive a new contract that contains changes to night and weekend calendar articles to improve the maintenance of non-stop times." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, chairwoman of the BMA committee for assistance physicians shared the last night in a message with "Registrar doctors have still raised serious concerns to the proposed contract, in particular that it is the current occupation crisis and it will be given to treat all physicians."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes by dialogue clashed with the government on reluctance to participate and sometimes on deafening silence.</seg>

<seg id="16">In the last two months, we talked to the committee of assistance doctors and responded positively to the concerns regarding guardianship and whistleblower with the Ministry of Health as well as other ministries.</seg>
<seg id="17">Employers hope that continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training, training courses, mutual recognition of curriculum, continuing education and gender pay in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers who were Health Education UK and the Ministry of Health in compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="3">The anticoagulant medication Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>

<seg id="6">NICE's regulatory authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that form floorings.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the flooring breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that caches the blood flow to the heart and thus causes a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clots dissolve, it can flow through the blood stream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more likely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The NICE draft resolution, published today, recommends a 12 month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE health technology evaluation center said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a new heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">With Ticagrelor's preliminary recommendation, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Political Correctness Culture flourishes in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutry Rahman was removed last year on the occasion of a government report on corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political Correctness has led to ignoring widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities as a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former member of Cabinet, Sir Eric Pickles, verbally attacks the police, election observers and town councils to ignore electoral abuse because of "intolerances of ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut-off belts outside of electoral cabins to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should have a badge to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the moment a voter must mention his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes to apply non-removable ink to a person's finger when they leave their vote to prevent someone electing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">He demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "this is not only conducive to electoral fraud, but should also protect the local government against the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that comes with it," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets election scandals in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special selection tribunal decided that the acting mayor of Lutfur was to be relieved of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry after a litany.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had "perverted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he silenced his critics with racist and Islamophobic accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the consequence of imitation in which one person was chosen as someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud across the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He expressed himself particularly alarming for the fraudulent choice of letters - among the older members of the Muslim community had pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the leadership of ID cards to prove identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report it says: "as proof it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistan or Bangladeshi background.</seg>

<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has left her voice to prevent anyone selecting twice.</seg>

<seg id="28">Ban that political activists edit full letter selections and envelopes of local elections.</seg>

<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that employees generally assert that voters go to the ballot box alone.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller subcontracted the immune system and the perfecting of a serious test by leveraging some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk abstained from a Euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a faucet of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the check-out of every object, he used a Luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to get in.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to check the sink of a traction toilet, which has been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Wright was known to test the resistance of his bowel by traveling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railroads to train stations to washing links of toilets, the task turned its immune system definitely under one sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he told:" "" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was in any case justified.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test finish showed a luminometric rating of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a russian toilet which he refused to refuse after its luminance quantity was over 4000 units, whereas fresh washed hands have one out of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and the Finnish maker of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," showing the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "That comes close to the worst I have smelled in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going to lick here because it is disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company is equipping Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the development of intestinal bacteria and immune systems.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valio Senior Venice president for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we really wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We carried out crazy brainstorming that ended up saying "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had instructed him to lick, just like the disgusting russian toilet which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to arouse them and others in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria particularly associated with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their social housing after a delogization with a damage of £50,000 because it had terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldone and her partner Shaun Tregucock were cast after a long list of complaints by their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">When they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employers found property in irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls have holes, wooden boards were piled up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the home administration at Cornwall Housing, said she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people and I think people don't have to live in that way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property will probably be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is also the same.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had joined was street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, stripping and cursing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldone, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which will be torn down under certain circumstances, old trash was found.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, wooden boards were torn up</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be invoked by the police on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delogized her and her partner forcibly from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Erasmus cement Manager of Cornwall Housing, stated that it would have agreed to co-operate with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals, 20 years long</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the church, garbage and old toys were thrown down.</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "it is a shame that the tenant agreed to accept any responsibility for her behaviour and her family, as a delay is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into account.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information we have provided.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="33">Workers of property management will now have to sweep away garbage mountains surrounding the house</seg>

<seg id="37">After they were homeless, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>

<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee decided to promptly set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan functionary informed that the former Sprinter and present coach, John Anzrah, gave a urine test in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800-metre-runner, Ferguson Rotich.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the team management of Kenya by the doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF world association has asked the IOC for information on the case in order to exert its own investigations, distributed an IAAF orator.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "depending on the results of the examination and the following measures of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," "" "she said in an IAAF statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"he (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and presented himself as Ferguson Rotich, submitted the sample and signed," explained Kenias Chief de Mission Stephan Arap Soi.</seg>

<seg id="18">Before the summer games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote on the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">They have understood in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because it's not stupid until now: summer holidays, heat and land-to-day elections - that is biting.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the election fighters, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="8">Practical problems come about: during the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and end up voices are difficult to find.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, the final and final days of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign shortly before the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear for his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition duel.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years of age and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as he did his legendary word-like predecessor, Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "otherwise, sea-ring has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel has the blame for the blooming of the AfD." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "their refugee policy, their" "" "We create that" "" "has speeded up the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its peak channel data, the Minister of Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is, when at the wrong time at the right place, election campaigns are made.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited German chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations; Merkel's election of the German Bundestag is in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other federal states," "" "said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's a shame not to listen to Angela Merkel from other corners of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Northeast-CDU largely renounces the usual campaign states on market places and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "that," "" "Kokert thinks, plays only a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union, too, has noticed that on the land you are crumbling the base that it has to be very tight to find a wire to the people again.</seg>
<seg id="26">You see it as the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly exists in the sides of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the advice of the CDU election fighter Kokert to his fellow combatants is also self-revealing: "they must go where it hurts, where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called out its SPD into a particularly committed electoral campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the S & D Group lastly lagged behind partner CDU (25) and just shortly before the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the election of 2011, the SPD was still clearly winning 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "the Greens, small party with seven percent in surveys, should make the leap into the land-day." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue of the necessity of vacations and largely migrate their campaign to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "online election campaign" "", "calls it the local president Claudia Müller." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise green campaigners are embarking on a search for traces of local abstainers among the holidaymakers.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>

<seg id="9">Since the construction site has moved to the south on Monday and the blockage of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen has been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg has again subsided, the traffic situation within the village has eased.</seg>

<seg id="12">"" "" "" "there have been considerable discomfort," "" "says Florian King responsible for the transport management of the refurbishment." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachkstrasse, Steinlachstrasse, Hafnerstraße and Weiherders had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping routes were seeking and more familiar to their navigation device than signposting.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some truck stops in residential areas frantically.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not complied with, the community also called for the measurement vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>

<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a little consolation that for customers from Rottenburg, the street is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the maps.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 renovation has led to revenue losses in them makes everyone look through.</seg>

<seg id="28">This is already existential threatening.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all the restaurants have "hit hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>

<seg id="34">"" "" "" "half of his associates have to dismiss." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt has replied to a request by Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, otherwise the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where something more generous was handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, family business has been here since 1715 and refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regular guests now look less frequently due to the complicated traffic guidance, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't come here, it is also very nice.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his pedigree is returning to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and a bird flu, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on his customers for the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history of history.</seg>

<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous year's month.</seg>

<seg id="17">Group sales chief Fred Kappler continued to report a sales report from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time, 5.904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had been manipulated by a software package.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW is calling for some 2.5 million vehicles to retrofit into the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of the rearmament, VW reaffirmed that the conversion of cars had no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After conversion of vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.</seg>
<seg id="23">After upgrading the car, the car manufacturer guarantees a "guaranteed" certification, but does not speak of a "guarantee" as it was said on Friday in corporate travel.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys silencers?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lone middle-aged men love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you go to the comment section to see him under the pseudonym non-Allegran Men's Middle Ages with harsh insults, this statement diverts itself from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Yougv, the reemergence of vinyl records is not based on a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but rather to midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely herb group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on television, I would follow the camera while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a humble grey suit and grazing wildly before I stop, hold my hands and say something better like: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Soho slowly gets lost in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices fill up the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, to whom I am Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) in Reckless Records (Number of data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4.000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him at home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably were a little too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers, who he meets, apply to YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also notices a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and get to see their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have conducted, people usually get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of fans of the record revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers accepted the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record covers, from objects that call happy rejoicing.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is for me as a collector so and I think it is so with a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally engage.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee flees from a stack of tables." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard of it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I smoother through a pile of bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here just recently and said," I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead sound plate so that I can put it on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less music-style.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I don't have a record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "Fopp, which has devoted almost an entire floor to the records, has a nice audience when I go in." ""</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops, Wild Beasts's latest synthesizers and sexiriated pop instead of experimental jazz are sounding out of the loudspeakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strangely lonely, but serious mental traumas are hard to find when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window display rather than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, therefore collecting sheets is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is... "it drives with a loving sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of panel lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While giving the impression to sign the denim pants, I watch a group of young age girls who group around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research shows that the results of YouGov agree, they, at least in record stores in Soho, disregard the large number of female collectors and turntables that exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their thursday morning with security, not with floats from Berwick Street and the sheets through plates while they flatter the gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old fake moderator, who hunts over shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">In a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary businesses where individuals within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energydrinks, sell, barber services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which harbour a risk of fire and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the Court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported unification and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable. "</seg>

<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the tearing was the Jungle Book Kids' Café des Lager, which is operated in the community and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>

<seg id="4">For example, on motorway construction sites or to rehabilitated bridges with temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>

<seg id="7">With Laser Measurement Technology, all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits and access restrictions after time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">The trailer can be moved by car with trailer hitch according to the manufacturer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-er rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis when they were hit with a result of 43-7 in the Deus Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji distributed a master class in handling, side-stepping, moving, line running and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was swept through the not too bad silver medal - Britain's fourth this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The marked defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this Fiji would have hit a 15-man-team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a consolation for the UK - but it will probably not - that at least one brite will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow: Fijis's head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">The GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago Ryan lost all the games at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began to wonder and allowed the attacks of GBs to bounce off.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. to run into driving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau overcame in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner, which he changed.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A rushed Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but he only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Athjasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the kick-off and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presided by further weak Tacklings of the GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while the UK was still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GGB made basic changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua passed Tuisova after a brilliant interim play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an experiment for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went off for a long time in favor of the South seapsulmen, whose fans sang, flags waved and danced on the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame replaced the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the Fijis embraced itself and GB bent down crushing into the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a tight semi-finals match from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks to the front in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emblematic gold than in these games and that will mean something.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard pieve that enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was omnipresent when they recruited for the second Olympic-old in the second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport, who laid on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39.000 unwritten application, which is also exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the style of the Arc de Triomphe.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to the incremental advances that make the difference and it was no more an assistant than the trainer who did not know if he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was fortunate that he was able to commence treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that was the correct term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory went their first thoughts to Williams, who spent a nerve wrecking tomorrow doing something more than usual and trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "panning who was a Captain of the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan said," "" "I was an emotional wreck this week. it might be a bit extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It just repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and Robin worked.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for German Steel Industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in millions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the sector threatened with green electricity production are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains in the release of the Renewable Energy Indispense with the existing plants for the so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, "said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday issue).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators in the steel works are replaced are an EEG levy of 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on self-electricity production.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thus the status quo of the present regulation is largely fixed.</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful effort made by Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular importance.</seg>

<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and a considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation continued to aggravate when the world's largest producer in China threw masses of steel on the world market in view of the ailing domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers have dumped Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has eased a little.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, imposed tariffs on import steel are showing effect, on the other hand, economic prospects have brightened up in China.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is not clear how long the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least the prices would have been stagnating.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">Finally ThyssenKrupp did not want to close the closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July German steel manufacturers are cautious in spite of rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a brief upliftment in May, the prepared amount left for the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been down two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with an increasing output.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing is good seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, in the teacher's degree course she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old is singing in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels well-balanced, cheerful and more lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">In doing so, she does something good for her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German seniors division.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Regular togetherness allows senior citizens to socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in their chorus:" "" "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of togetherness." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be strenuous in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">After all, seniors train deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly challenge his lungs are not as fast as they can in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">For older people, Singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Working Group of the Seniors Organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, it explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lyrics and especially melodies tend to deduce people who are suffering from dementia.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, a special performance is demanded to the head, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">Concentrating simultaneously on one's voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just elderly people who live alone practice not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one hears through singing in the choir, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I do something for a long time, I'll get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior boy's choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found over the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you do not have access to the internet, your family, friends or neighbours can ask for help from the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does well and has something liberating - that is true for all ages.</seg>

<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosives had gone into the air in a flower bed before the Revier of the Coastal Police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, there were several wounded in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon at the south-east coast.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was called by a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bomb attacks carry the same handwriting," said Army general Danai Kritanmethavee Friday early in front of journalists.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "we assume that this is a coordinated attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to express itself on possible motives - but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks that is typical of the Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist insurgency movement or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, restricted to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">On the contrary, one assumes that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">The authorities would have kept secret references to upcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days - however, they were not informed about the exact time and location.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police put their officials across the country to enhance security around important government buildings, airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are repeatedely smaller bombings, but mostly they are not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace that was used for years by Thailand King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the well-fledged bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommended on its homepage to follow the instructions given by the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwate, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="30">After disputes between the security forces and the Muslim population, not necessary trips to these provinces will be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military enormous influence in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta Chef and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country was moving towards stability, improving economic conditions and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody riots, is able to keep the kingdom in order to restore stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the revolting uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok by a assault on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack of the recent history of the country.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fees per cubic metre of wastewater amount to 3,44 Euro for the sewage system Neudorf / Reuth / Welshalling 3.44 instead of 2,10 Euro. for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 Euro (until now 2.26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3,64 Euro (until now 2.18 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the sewage treatment will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a rough calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, during the approval of the budget by the district council Kulmbach, it was found that underground structures were running for these sewage plants.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the systems in a cost-covering manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of October 1, 2016, citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Welshochschule, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into the wallet.</seg>
<seg id="7">Revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt presented to the committee, a new calculation of the fees for the sewage plants of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or overlaps from the preceding calendar period shall also be equated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt founded the grave fee increases with the fact that all three wastewater installations were relatively small, with a very low wastewater downfall, which lodged between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the low distribution basis for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three systems is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, due to their age refurbishment and repair expenses, all three systems have fallen in a considerable scope for all three installations.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welshochschule, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt explained that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the waste water plant in Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping station Welshahl, the nearly 20-year-old conveying systems had to be overhauled and the first sewage pond had to be removed after almost 20 years of operation, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation option could be installed in order to comply with the water regulations.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses included the continued maintenance and maintenance costs that must be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs which have been significantly below the current level of the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the small sewage treatment in the three plants, the expenses for the operation and maintenance were "fully penetrated."</seg>
<seg id="20">In doing so, Schmidt complained that the market community of large entertainment costs have been spared during the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the aforementioned facilities will continue to be precarious in the long run, as the supply of the Friesenbachtal waste water utility company could not be extended because these facilities are deficient.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat states that this filter anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, it makes Snapchat possible around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are immaculate, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All mistakes are brought to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have critiqued critics in the past where they were accused that the app would promote Blackface or promote white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "when this week struck a filter with a few users who gave them slit-eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called a racist cartoon of Asians -" "" "yellow face." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat wedded that it would have turned off the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company apologized: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism recalled the filter of hurting clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Savapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely spread across the photos, wrote that the filter was "infringing and mildly uncomfortable."</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "she added that" "" "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very reluctant Asian cartoon and the filter effects." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face has been dragged into the disappearing extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling block.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats filters creates an image that is insulting for a user, "it is much more difficult for such things to remain unnoticed than it used to be," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on media and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticised the large part white, only male leaders and ended their attachment with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "either they have no representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so that they can make such decisions," "" "said the Chinesich-American Zhu," "" "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions in which they are safe or comfortable to say what about it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left the Snapchat unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, it declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a personnel responsible, focusing on submissive population groups and internal integration efforts.</seg>

<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "intelligence information typically gendered by high-level commanders, regularly drew a more positive picture of the US efforts against terrorism as it would have permitted the actual conditions on the spot and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence agencies," "" "quoted a newspaper article." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in the CentCom are right up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there are no direct indications that government officials under Obama have given orders to change the reports, it shows how analysts counter the pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, comments and statements before the congress were considerably more positive than the facts" "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom nobleman announced publicly that a military reconquest of Mossulm could start in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigations, it's so clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the leaders of the Central Command changed intelligence reports to play down the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The republicans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts took care of manipulating reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed findings while the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigation of the CentCom reports is under way by the Secretary General of the Department of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence services to ISIL and the Iraqi security services," "" "stated the highest ranking Democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process," "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "swore the morals under analysts and" "" "gave too little room for different opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of a White House intervention in the CentCom analysts regarding a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "the preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published on Tuesday by" "" "The Daily Beast" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon general inspector, who after complaints by CentCom were admitted.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesperson, in a statement that the Ministry of Defense did not comment on the congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector were still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the allegations of last year have raised the question of what President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information on the Islamic State is reminding feudalism of more than ten years ago when a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush looked at the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker, according to government officials, stated that contrary to the government's declarations against the refineries held by the Islamic State, there would have been no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation, as these temporary refineries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this recognition has not been published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">CentCom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislative body because of his overly positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="2">A day after having shot three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said that she could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "I have no idea." "" "she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which of the two teams from six teams will win the first and second place each.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will take the strong Dutch little longer out of the way to guide the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whatever the game starts on Saturday, the American women have triggered a surprising vortex by their success story, four years after they landed at the last London games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time with three years wearing a hockey racket in her hands (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), at the age of 16 she became the national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the 2008 Olympics because she could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>

<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the gate row in the first half of the game with a back-hand stroke.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed up surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game into her hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">It completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved in the middle and loaded the ball into the gate to get the American female a 2-0 guide.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the age of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro s events feel constantly and inevitably, a raging relay between competition and striving.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick that is passed from the wristband to the swimmers to the gymnast for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the waiting period in the coffeShop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, for the first time at the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with dimples, could well have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising if he were a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shadow there are the sports that are not generally accepted: pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I would like to make a modest argument for my particular favourite, then let me draw attention to the discrete charme of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years it has been so sparse noticed that many of the, I had asked, did not know that it is actually an Olympic portart.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the US sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal on the trampoline and has had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert but only an experienced enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has a humorous potential - the kartoonous trembling of its never-ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially unites.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "Trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as" "" "jumping board" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rising champions jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to move a number of falling movements (turning, pike and salutation) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are evaluated according to official Olympic programme of execution, difficulty level and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-round athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists in their quest for gold need to go further, faster, up and down, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes up and down, up and down at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also in the TV transmission another ridiculous goal: the world or the Olympiarecond.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator into tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel as tiresome when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly upwards again.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolf in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant annulment of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; that of the men on Saturday, also at 13: 00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will exude the final rounds as part of a afternoon bloc on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Mania they promise a calm, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the angling and the objection of male athletes, according to the Wall Street Journal, according to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley expects his new fan community to arrive.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long is an ally of the US</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia met the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses alleged that during the clashes with the police, dozens of protesters were killed in shooting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia right to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and spread to more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government's response was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Circulating videos on the protests, probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security men beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now asking for a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at an impressive pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued to suppress the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, whereby dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or imprisoned, killed or driven to the deserts of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and have no other options apart from protesting, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold over power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions are rising along the border to Eritrea; a battle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were forced more or less in recent years, could use the turbulence and be able to arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are exploding after years of drinking in front of the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">In recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, because cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services have improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government locks the access to Facebook and Twitter what it does at regular intervals, especially among protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians admitted that they gathered together as protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia predominantly Christian high-countries, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this too is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are there to coordinate under one umbrella," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray who account for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is Meles Zenawi's death.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-publicized disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well-versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Ethiopian, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia had witnessed such turmoil in 2005, after thousands protest against polls, apparently committed by the government and stolen from the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the past months and this period of riots went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal abnormality of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharian city, attacked by Tigray and hatred towards the Tigray becomes more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests push the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighbouring Somalia, although it recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declares his claim Obama had been founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump, on Friday, attempted to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raises new questions on the communication skills of the Republicans' presidential candidates whether he is able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his comrades who endeavor to take him in protection during an eventful period, in the peculiar position to declare statements that he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After making the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump relied on the allegation on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to point out, the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the opposite to the previous day Mr Trump said in a number of interviews, he said the accusation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate wanted to know nothing about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism bounces down to Mr. Trump while trying to draw the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand values.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump again tried to return to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their words boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he criticised himself when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs Clinton's emails, but later he said "Of course I mean sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic borders in politics and then back up as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans how they arrive and then" "" "clarify" "" "depending on how the reaction expires." "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has assumed an even more appreciative note, as his return values have gone farther.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, published on Friday, showed a lead with a huge margin in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign Mr. Trumps jokes his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable position to stand to him regardless of how provocally his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent advocates, took great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview of Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "Mr. Giuliani said he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called her hind-broker, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as the Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by attacking the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running around each of his words and being biased against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he defied the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts who try to understand him and said," "" "You can't!." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats sneered at Mr. Trumps's apology as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once pushed over the price of the market, café returns to Greenpoint</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a nice café in Williamsburg, where one could only pay cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served for 15 years of good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices were pushed out of his Bedford Avenue store front.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Soap Cherie business, replacing the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local people roamed it as the last loss in a city of gentrifying.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is a change, it's reinvention as well.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north from its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started to work at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered to provide funds for a new branch, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for bagels the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu stand sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sour onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no more beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also displaced by prizes from Williamsburg," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg and visited the club on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after being moved to Greenpoint, she would take the path.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb had closed she gave up a coffee rink for a while, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "I realized that it was the coffee and culture in the verb I liked," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a blended Chai Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.</seg>

<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper desiccots.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a seldom served luxury.</seg>

<seg id="40">President Roosevelt would perhaps have committed the same mistake, if not his wife Eleanor asked him to write an example with his stomach.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebral animal is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks mostly come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to date.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie only gets offspring with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Greenland-shark floats leisurely along the North Atlantic Ocean, in an hour, it comes in average just 1,220 metres far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This long-term lifestyle, however, seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal "Science" in any case from a Greenland-shark which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist suspected long that Greenland would become stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence lacked.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland sharks are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the Grönlandhaie's lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="17">They measured their time-motion when they equipped six animals with a transmitter before Spitzbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Still this sharks make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea and look for cadavers that fall from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenlankhaie who caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimetre measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a remarkable amount of carbon-14 in the lenticular core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Its birth was therefore to lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons were carrying large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third-smallest animal with 220 cm length, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In contrast, all larger Greenland sharks had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lens nucleus, resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland-shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record-shark with its 502 centimetres might even be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönlandhai-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood on the threshold to the sexually mature and his age was determined at 156 years, Grönlandhaie with the multiplication obviously allow for at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such methusalems live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Grönlandwal, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120 year old harpoon point, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there frequently runs on sparring.</seg>
<seg id="36">They then mature later - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as soon as possible," "" "explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should, on the other hand, invest their resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media uprising after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed any Israeli choice, as Arab guests had requested "according to one employee."</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, left his trouble at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>
<seg id="4">During his last stay Lanzmann tried to find Israel at the country's country list.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be invoked directly from the hotel room.</seg>

<seg id="2">The altar boys from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the road on a four-day pilgrimage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all the registrants for two years, the senior ministerial round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were tested and finally decided for the Bishop's City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, with the opening of the Holy Year of Mercy on Fribourg cathedral, a special pilgrimage destination was offered.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and of Gruene, and Haigerloch, and the chambers of the sanctuary, went their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening, pastor Storost sent pilgrims in a small ceremony in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrimage and parted the pilgrim's blessing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Von Horb was taken by train to the starting point in Villingen, where a Münster Uneser loved woman, and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the minis at field crosses, chapels or churches made a break in order to sing a song from specially assembled pilgrims song booklet.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the overnight stays the parish halls of the local parishes were available.</seg>
<seg id="12">Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller took care of the stage targets for a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we went on Furtwangen to Gütenbach on the second day.</seg>
<seg id="14">On top of that, one entered the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting distance, but had to first descended some 500 metres altitude and then be heard again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a barbecue at the Badger in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the imposing church of St. Peter we went to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">The minis were visibly relieved and happy in the late afternoon at the Freiburg Minster and passed through the gates of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse, God was given thanks.</seg>
<seg id="19">Minis by operator Markus Obert, arrived at the evening Mass in Münster, was welcomed in the evening mass in Münster.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men's team sprint in Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor that his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. the Jumpy made the legend proudly when he stormed home to win a victory from the favourites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Four years ago, England claimed a shocking victory, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they only took sixth place in the London Underground World Championships in March, despite his resignation of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as executions.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scotsman that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner placed an Olympic ord in the qualification rounds but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder lay just behind his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner considered it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, in which Hindes went in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy saw from his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic ord in the final round and beat the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kennys and Hoys, Hindu admitted that after a weak start, he intentionally fell off the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no acquittal of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hindu said," "" "It feels like the whole GB flags on the tribune as London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many worldly titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the cycle.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny, it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23rd (a seemingly holy date for British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same as Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part next in the sprint that starts today and will go for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I only enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "Hinder said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Brahim Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the destination in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The World Record, which won gold in London in 2012, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had argued with officers prior to the qualification yesterday when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and ended tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a pair of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">In April, the withdrawal of Shane Sutton's technical director, Shane Sutton's resignation in April in the midst of sex and bulbbing accusations, as well as the retirement of variables such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">But if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks quite like that the now legendary GGBs, who has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="3">This step followed the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, not to grant any further subsidies to the operation of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs at the plant of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No fewer than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects as the melt consuming roughly 10 percent of total electricity generation Victorias consumes.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa added the point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The smelting of Alcoa in Portland is losing money and risking a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, who supplies the large aluminium meltdown with his Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions.</seg>

<seg id="15">The contracts have a period of 12 months, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "therefore, AGL expects that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenues," "" "said the current supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on the income to AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already written the value of the contracts already in its annual closing price of $187 million in "anticipation of a termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts, the" "" "Ability Alcoas... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt" "" "does not compromise." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which would have come into force from November this year, even if there is still an explanation as to why it has withdrawn from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melt plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and Internet in slow motion: the Nokia Communicator came on the market 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - his maker experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed nearly half kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good in the hand either.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was rather clumsy.</seg>

<seg id="13">Indeed, the new mobile phone could be a lot for those standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax, the communicator was to be reached.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, albeit slowly slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we found a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Quite proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, thus about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could guess in August 1996 that communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just like in 2012 in London, when we used a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great advantages for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">As they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of Heathrow's expansion is too big.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blamed on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked to him.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympics, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in spirited growth and bequeathed a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and the whole of the UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, who has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 - five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, to the T2, which was built in the middle of the world's two most frequented catwalks.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to provide a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="2">For companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers there are attempts to circumvent ad blocking, a "cat and mouse game."</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blockages on its desktop site, Adblock Plus released a blog post in which it informed that users could update their filters in the program to again block advertising in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop site would change the coding for its advertisements to make it difficult to detect the recognition of which part of the page advertising is.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of keeping and felling between the open source community and the bypasses has been underway since the invention of indicator blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has joined battle is a strong indication of how worrying scoring blockers have become the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">Worldwide, according to a study of the last year of Pawair and Adobe, employ around 200 million people scoring blockers; almost four times as much 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">With 1.03 billion active users, who access their mobile devices on Facebook, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenues.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably inhabitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere could once have experienced similar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, erdsimilar atmosphere and yet slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably referred to more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus shows its day-side of the sun for almost two months," "" "said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus, similar to evolution, which was previously thought by planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably inhabitable, Venus -- over the course of several billions years --was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans were evaporating and their steam was burned away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen escaped just a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide having a mortal greenhouse effect left -- the Venus, which as we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest Mission with Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to gather the complete catalog of rotational rates among the stars of the constellation of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers to understand why stars rotate in the star cluster to different rates, and in what context the rotation periods are associated with the formation of the planet.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star loops, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age, and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star-name of the Pleiades lies 445 light-years distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are making themselves the quickest now.</seg>

<seg id="2">Caught: due to a positive doping test, Weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland will not be allowed to start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">An experienced athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh race day, the first official doping cases have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmers Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter obstacle-runner Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested thoroughly in Brazil and excluded - immediately prior to the beginning of the already critically pollinated athletics competitions, these news are coming to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide has already been proven last Sunday which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Court of Sports CAS confirmed their expulsion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old took fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterflies, only 0.09 seconds missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen should have taken part in the courses over 50 m freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested the opening of the B test and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">The national association takes the matter very seriously and demands full co-operation with the investigations, "Xinhua quoted from a message:" we will cooperate with the International Court of Sports CAS and will accept the judgement. "</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history it is not the IOC but the CAS responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also during the night of Rio the news leaked through the positive test at Danekova, the 33-year-old went on the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "said the Bulgarian TV station BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she is innocent," "" "the only explanation might be dietary supplements," "" "explained the athlete." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, the blood doping agent EPO should act in the forbidden substance.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B test should have already been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov immediately reported criticism to the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," "" "he said," "" "We are under observation, so many have already been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday, also known as "Adrian Zielinski," the London Olympic champion in the class of up to 85 kg was also tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon for three days.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny the intake, however, both must not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the athletes' start, especially the case Danekova is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The World Association IAAF was banned from the entire Russian team except for the exception of systematic doping, and even the Läufernation Kenya has produced numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the former treaties in China had also taken care of violent clashes between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">For instance, the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt purple."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "when I see the podium above 200 m freestyle, I want to hand over," "" "said Lacourt in the French radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also the focus of a debate with Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping fraud," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun had been positive for the Chinese Championships in 2014 on the stimulant Trimetazidin, but only had to wait for a three-month lockout.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide blackmail her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail-malware are currently targeted at targeted companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes at 540 companies in North America, UK and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been subjected at least once, sometimes several times victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom fees demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators, according to the observations of Malwarebytes, specialize in attacks on company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially potentially blackout ransom is much higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware" "", "says Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the painting programs were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was scary in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on the computer of an victim, it searches for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals in a sustainable way.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the press.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final key code to the files, the victims have to transfer money - mostly in the form of Bitcoin's cryptocurrency.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without ceasing production.</seg>
<seg id="17">The damage is correspondingly higher if a ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported loss of revenue by ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt the business operation, in one case, people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals had already been victims of attacks, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only encourage the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies paying, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "for managers it is difficult to reject the perpetrators" demand in the face of downtime in operation. "" "</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers from F-Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to earn more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain to their victims via chat, as they can pay per Bitcoin, set free accessible support websites or decrypt free sample files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals are redeemed after payment of a few hundred euros, companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to retrieve their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively low risk gains from the ransomware extortion, the hackers become more and more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of the anti-virus supplier Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware around within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that it is about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software block to the actual extorates.</seg>
<seg id="30">The so-called malware kits have been created using malware itself, consulting, and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "included in delivery is an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The extortionists then seek further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the boards underground, buys the set from a criminal and commissions another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is per certified computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually, criminals assign spammers to spread," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey rely on file-back-ups and scanner software to be able to repel ransomware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful exhaustion, the offenders rather threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "declares Malmsten CEO Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the damage potential is much higher than before, depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators will also be able to take up entirely new targets on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz, Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the activation of such a blockaded heating could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the little HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds pretty much overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1,60 m high HR-V seems small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear, it does not work in any place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and work comfortably, only the upper side of the cockpit collapses.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles when it comes to storage space.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like chin chairs and thus offer storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor up to ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot is well loaded, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he should do his job somewhat more quietly.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another mechanization: a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top variant" "" "Executive" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (working at speeds 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "the collision warner sometimes confuses because he assesses many obstacles as" "" "approaching objects" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The long-beam assistant is very reliable.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent template responds to the traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation navigation, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI jacks are below the armrest and are therefore a bit awkward to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel is fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">It stalls regularly on the bypass - here a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this should change: the right-wing ambiance should be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is a good news for all the car drivers who are driving in traffic on the ambient road every evening when they drive on the highway for Zubringer (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">The road construction will be extended on Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August) in the area between the Hammer Street and the Weser Straße, the right-hand lane lane by 700 meters.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drivers can then thread directly from the Hammer street on the right.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening you roll around eternally, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning it is already far ahead of the wake-up ring no more to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is everything else than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, with such problems in good society: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of the adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not restful.</seg>
<seg id="5">What are sleeping problems or sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there are many causes underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society of Sleeping Beauty and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you see for the time being, however, is the insomnia, so an inlet and diarrhea disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "falling asleep readily feels many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate," "" "says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board member of the German Medical Association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this can be organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is common in case of depression," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, who has a herniated disc, can lie badly, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly begins to hail about everyday problems and worries, breathing out an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleeping disorders be recommended?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month or at least three nights a week should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look very different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate the problem of sleep, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Among other things, treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">Relaxed sleeping medicine hardly exists in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Research Centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, in case of sleep problems, one should first contact the family doctor.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by investigations if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep and what will happen?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, doctors advise doctors in the sleeping laboratory for snoring with breathing dropouts, abnormal weariness of the day, sleep transducers or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disturbance, says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please don't make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After calabling you go to bed for a normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-goggles, a chest strap and a antennae on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera records the sleeping ends at the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Shoebox counts: regular sleep and stand-up times, not too long in bed, don't sleep on the day, do not watch TV to sleep, avoid alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is absolutely not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, the civil servants of the Düsseldorf police managed the arrest of two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspects had committed several bags of pocket and luggage as a gang.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 21.30, civilian officials in the area of the Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang that was known to policemen from past theft.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several offences since the middle of July of this year and went on a joint, labour-intensive and particularly professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the criminal commissioner 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thieves, which had been specially prepared for the offence of criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="8">In total, they exploited more than 15,000 Euro.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, some linden trees, in between a remnant of cobblestones: the Riga Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one goes along the road from east to west, one passes playgrounds, a fresher kindergarten and a biolade.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone sprayed at the facade of a grey house." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite of a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "articles about this" "" "trendy district" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, however, are preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rented contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin interior senator Henkel has been dealing with the police against the project several times since the beginning of the year, describing the area as a "no-go-zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After evacuating the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers on June 22, the police patrolled official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal and a day later police and construction workers under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain vorm late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects lie a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left-hand violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the neighbourhood since 1999, and Jana *, who here catches three children here, is particularly annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, which predominantly demanded police protection from the vacant left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin interior senator and the police set up between landlords and their neighbours, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class quarter, which also today compared to the rest of the city a low average income and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Home occupations and the born living projects have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, among them almost the entire Mainzer Straße in the vicinity of the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was swept under great police force in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly magnets for tourists and election-Berliners from all over the world: with them, residents of GDR times and former home occupants are now sharing their neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is reflected in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them from winded panes or freshly painted facades, which were eject with color-bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year together with the words" "" "Left-autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason why not all neighbours consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury are based on statistics almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the criminal offences cause damage, which tend to meet the newbuildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a tenant house next to the controversial 94, there can be no question of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violent acts, it is important: the 94 people are their neighbors, they were certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rīga.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here you can help each other, live together on the street and get more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has been deliberately drawn into the street of Riga - and has remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That's why it was so important to it that the local residents got their way back: from the police, politics and the media, which all of a sudden claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neugebauer, the road is still taken away from them: by faceless new buildings in former mosquitoes that are displacing the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "in the end, these are condos which are not interesting for many - rather people who are not so well-searched," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I absolutely cannot approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what do you have to do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for drawn-out, who annoy him about color bombs: the house projects and the left-wing scene were part of the "Kiez."</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who come here should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub area, can complain bad about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented only with first names have asked them not to be named with their correct name.</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social educator supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact person for all stakeholders: refugees, working group refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is here now, the soothing wool mellow, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus some - less ridiculously, rather than target the multitude of desired tasks - meant when the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, an enviable Wollmatchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But managing work is not her central area, Annika Deuschle writes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it concerns organisation, work with people on site and behind the scenes as well as network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent job on a term of three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine client that Annika Deuschle supports hone- and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be stationed in Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "a serious problem has been for some time finding apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They need to accommodate the refugees in their own or hired living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Land's Office to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It does not work so far, unless you depend on private residences, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "therefore, community apartments must be sobered as it is so beautiful." ""</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence there are internships, apprenticeships, training centres, one-euro-jobs and temporary employment for refugees and migrants who need to be found or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help master craftsmen, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "that is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not mean only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People should develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here too, administration and volunteers are jumping.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who develop the feeling that in Urbach can't help anyone, don't work and be useless who will never be able to integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are problems too, customer honestly, "people with whom nothing works." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always motivating others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is a mammoth task.</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalisation after recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine's customer quite clearly," "" "what some naive might call." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "these incidents are also a topic among the refugees." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins were completely retrieved.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">Therefore, the main and volunteers must look for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon there could be a new push for refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, the policy is heinous.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to spot them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "we haven't arrived in Urbach where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes clear that the Urbacher has already been utilized to properly integrate the existing people.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
