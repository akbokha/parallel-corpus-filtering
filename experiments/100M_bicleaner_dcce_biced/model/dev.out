Obama welcomes Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
both of them wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and T@@ eher@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ zing actions in the Middle East .
but the meeting should also deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement expansion and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal promoted by Obama , the Iranian nuclear programme has further wor@@ sen@@ ed the relationship between the two .
in March , at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the U.S. Congress , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel .
in a distress call , professor is admitted to have shot his girlfriend
in a distress call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead wife could be found on the phone .
inside the house the officials found the bodies of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I am so sorry , I wanted to und@@ o it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where , according to the police , he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ ti@@ ff Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff heard shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has done the fatal emergency call some@@ time after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb inspired .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or a criminal background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time there were some tendencies towards problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion that Lamb had worked so hard would not be a guarantee of an automatic path to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found the trail of Lam@@ bs when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner methane Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people living there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the University in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy .
he received his doctorate in education in the spring .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 when they met together with friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game .
at that time , he was the flock of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls melt away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no deed of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos; Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb hit Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail stepped both on a summer @-@ fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar close to Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night on the night 5 . September for the last time that Lamb ended his guitar and mouth organ playing in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were at the clearing and j@@ oked each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first @-@ semester program and specialized in American native peoples and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and student committee .
on Tuesday evening around 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and attended a candle light memorial service including teachers , staff , students and members of the community .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Mah@@ n@@ guard , singing &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected in order to reflect that the police now says that Lamb had the emergency call after he shot down Schmidt , and that Lamb called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
Toys R Us say that it will not hire as many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said it would plan to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers throughout the country . 45@@ ,000 workers were hired during Christmas 2014 .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with application interviews this month and the number of employees will rise from October to December .
while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business approaches , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equip shops with employees that sell , send and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox is jo@@ king over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the Ro@@ y@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated y@@ awn and an arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed the greatest time travel film ever made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
general Secretary B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says its response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN chief again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the fr@@ inge of the meeting of ministers of the General Assembly to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the Regional Po@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to drag Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks during surveys , it has ( yet ) not work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ in@@ ating the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early during the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom also won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now realize Tr@@ um@@ ps staying power and begin to let their dollars to flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey data suggest@@ ing that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University revealed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa concluded last week that 60 percent of Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as a candidate .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; delighted &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of ten say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; vs. 40 percent , which say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republi@@ cans do not see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive remarks , 52 percent of Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Republi@@ cans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per for a president , as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is true in the nation &apos;s first pres@@ election state , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Republi@@ cans believe that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his tem@@ per does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their schol@@ ar hats , Republi@@ can voters keep Tr@@ ump for real .
when asked who will most likely win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four out of ten said that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change from the time when four of ten at the end of July continued their money at J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a large number of GO@@ P voters have seen Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans were gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while anti @-@ dump@@ ing support is diff@@ used on more than a dozen other Candi@@ dates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is re@@ aping majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , ahead of J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday proves that only a little more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump are saying they have strongly par@@ don@@ ed their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can truly say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to go to other candidates .
nevertheless Tr@@ um@@ ps is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon , Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with dump on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ape R@@ ape &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse was in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that Tr@@ ump &apos;s bom@@ b@@ astic expression will keep Hi@@ z@@ pan@@ o Americans away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post pol@@ l of Monday , six of 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with dump on immigration issues .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , it seems to be Donald Tr@@ ump .
the fru@@ stration of the government has climbed to new levels .
meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son account for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days survey by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are fur@@ ious at Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hel@@ lish anno@@ yed . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : Germany &apos;s five most exclusive residential districts
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea att .
in the street , a square meter of a roof @-@ roof house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers a square meter costs most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential neighbor@@ hoods , however , the price comes as pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate service provider Angel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meters prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros ( per square meter ) .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is exceptionally not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : soccer Mat@@ ching La@@ unch thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
two @-@ time scor@@ er in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ star Thomas Müller has a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller led the FC Bayern to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pir@@ äus - then it went .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have embark@@ ed on a dream start into the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; from FC Bayern in the Pi@@ ra@@ eus &quot; Wit@@ ches bo@@ ilers .
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the gre@@ ek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ fri@@ d ( 8@@ 9th ) deser@@ ved with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth race success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola will finally bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
in his 28th hit in the Champions League , Müller was rewarded with the help of Olympic @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper , Roberto , who had a thou@@ ghtful shot of the world champion pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised before the match in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated presentation without gl@@ it@@ tering .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent home games in the top class , including famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid and Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund stum@@ bled over here in 2011 ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bav@@ arians , un@@ defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously with their offensive efforts , but often too inv@@ inci@@ ble to work .
the attacks were often initiated by reloc@@ ation to the left @-@ hand side of Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k from the right half @-@ field in the left upper triangle .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion for@@ gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half .
first of all , when the Olympic @-@ stri@@ ker Ide@@ ye Brown beat the poles of the poles from the line ( 26th ) .
then by direct transfer , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ed with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bayern took up its usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to set con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous pins .
but there was a mistake at Manuel Neu@@ er &apos;s door@@ keeper .
so for example , when he led a shot of ide@@ ye over the l@@ aces ( 5@@ 6th ) .
prior to Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola had a four @-@ dimensional chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who did it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports committee Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to do something else , that &apos;s vi@@ cious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the killed Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Götz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear for 13 minutes , Müller put a bit on it .
before the game , it had come to Kra@@ v@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly war@@ med Bayern @-@ fans in their audience @-@ block apparently provoked the supporters of Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and proce@@ eded with bat@@ ons against the Munich tra@@ ilers .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , har@@ ms not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : when reno@@ unc@@ ing , the risk quickly drops .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of pre@@ mat@@ urely losing their teeth to 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 times higher .
the scientists had observed over 23@@ 300 participants .
tooth decay causes tooth decay and inflammation of the g@@ ums , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the relationship between smoking and tooth loss is therefore reduced to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years before the endanger@@ ment again fell to the level of qu@@ itting smoking , explained Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , head of study H@@ einer flew from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and vessels and according to our findings also leads to a good dental health up to the high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness had been affected by the DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking reduces the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ pins the findings .
archae@@ ologists are encounter@@ ing lef@@ to@@ vers from the late Anti@@ quity
archaeological findings have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
near the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
histori@@ ans have been searching for so @-@ called land@@ marks since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine .
for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Archae@@ ological Natural Monument Care .
in the third construction section of the Rhine @-@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists were now found .
from text documents it was already known that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , Trier explained .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with some 350 graves that belonged to the church .
young woman caught by freight train
after a young woman is caught up at the station in the Gei@@ lenk@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Alle@@ e , the German Federal Police is asking the people for help .
on early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 p.m. the woman from the direction of Bahn@@ ho@@ fs@@ wald crossed the track at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
in order to shar@@ pen the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TT@@ IP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
according to this , the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states are to be replaced by a more transparent system , which corresponds to considerably more traditional courts in its functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the responsible commission@@ er Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström during the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposes introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced its support .
TT@@ IP aims to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings specifically envis@@ age that the EU states and the United States jointly choose independent judges for a new Investment Court .
they are to come from the EU , the US and third countries .

up to now , the parties involved agreed to each other on refer@@ ees , there was no obj@@ ection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months it has become clear that citizens don &apos;t trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , Malm@@ ström commented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it intends to work towards an International Investment Court .
there could , for example , settle disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) , required above all by major corporations , is considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a sort of parallel justice that firms can breach of compensation for tax pay@@ ers , negotiate national laws or cut down consumer and environmental standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ act identified the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was especially critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the F@@ TA agreement which had already been negotiated with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , however , described the plans as a great advance .
the Commission took into account essential points in the reform of the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , in spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration shall be from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European Business Association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the legal action of the economy by too many new rules .
small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged thereby .
it remains unclear when the negotiations on the TT@@ IP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) trade agreement have been concluded .
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is no longer acceptable .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens was on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him stands a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy acting folk singer recorded the picturesque US state of Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the whole audience , about 40 people , is almost seized by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he re@@ counts on the basis of different places he repeatedly records on the map , about his meticul@@ ous and tender arranged songs .
where they arose and what it looks like in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens proves himself to be a wonderful creative person .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; cle@@ ver@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously with American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great opul@@ ence at any time .
it is rum@@ oured that &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 States federal states should be ob@@ s@@ essed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and breaks positively certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this reduces St@@ ev@@ ens here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician who lives in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) a well @-@ known master@@ work appears in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
convincing ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board Charts and is missing in no one @-@ year list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth decent studio album is still wide orchest@@ rated , but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ b .
long since the smaller clubs sprung up , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage decoration .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .
in the dark@@ ened ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests now sit in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly out@@ grown St@@ ev@@ ens comes back to in@@ timacy and folk .
without saying a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad @-@ enriched album .
you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can therefore throw away the &quot; record . &quot;
only to an en@@ core is St@@ ev@@ ens mo@@ dest@@ ly thanks , plays acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally gets under thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s dé@@ but has been eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by the Prime Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ ings and for the first time create with David Cameron . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to provide the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after mid@@ day , while his performance by the media is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several titles in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokesperson said he was &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two News@@ night Programme , he suggested to the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they appe@@ aled to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
the BBC &apos;s political correspon@@ dent Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; st@@ acking &quot; within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour made changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow worker and pen@@ sion@@ er minister said that the party is &quot; very clear , &quot; that it is only against government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26.@@ 000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he has been a T@@ ory leader over the Dis@@ patch Box in Parliament over the last decade .
the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s questions are too con@@ front , and that he will be subject to both &quot; punch skill &quot; and the stri@@ pe with bar@@ bs , and that he has decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges facing young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister , will represent him if he does not take part - for example , when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also talked about the idea that other colleagues would occasionally speak the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ s@@ cow , the speaker of the Lower House , in order to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch P@@ unch &quot; that is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s question . but a few years later he admitted he failed .
since it was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television in 1990 , the question was viewed with the prime minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the Lower House and his position among his parliamentary colleagues , although critics have argued that she had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed extensive reforms .

pound increases through accelerated growth in the United Kingdom
the pound was jump @-@ like according to data , which indicate an increase in the growth of the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the ge@@ o @-@ target SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage had been the fastest and quick@@ est estimates since 2009 at the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to 1,@@ 37@@ 30 euros .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1,@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over @-@ offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ en@@ core shares climbed 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken 2.5 billion $ by stock sales as part of his strategy of lowering debt .
the shares of the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his appreciation for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax profit of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the chief of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labor costs of his company , he says .
the cost could hit the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber in the Capital : on Bie@@ ber @-@ Expedition in Berlin
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar .
young , 21 years young , a hanging sign with an over@@ lay@@ ered financial crisis .
the type with plat@@ inum @-@ bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros difficult .
more and more .
currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 turns through .
like Vik@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 year old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Victoria from Poland .
but since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the Bie@@ ber Construction : here you live I@@ dol , whose poster is hanging in Sz@@ cz@@ ec@@ in , since Monday evening .
the Suite , where the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much on the day as her M@@ um E@@ wa deserves in half a year .
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , my Vik@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the tenth class in the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fulfill her dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
school attendance ?
who che@@ ers it ?
the fans don &apos;t .
also Bie@@ ber himself does not .
that has already taken care of .
for the advertisement in the promotion @-@ break of the super @-@ class he cas@@ hed three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ple company , many , many dollars on the Bie@@ ber account .
and with every doll that looks like it and goes over the counter , Bie@@ ber also collects .
if Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , one is amazed at the window pane .
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e went too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; others stress that Bie@@ ber is finally in the US and UK with his new single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at number 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os at first .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Lebanese to the idea of a potato
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
both are possible - namely in the potato woo@@ fers , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the word &quot; potato instead of D@@ öner , &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay Pot@@ ato and meat put together a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which he had seen by chance on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer has been turning in its store , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea of the Lebanese hosts has meanwhile been registered by the Patent Office in Munich .
it has recently been protected as a utility model according to the authorities .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t want to betra@@ y hay as much meat and as much potatoes as the sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only as much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the culinary international understanding also works well with its customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Met@@ cash La@@ un@@ ches So@@ il Stabili@@ zation Camp@@ aig@@ n for Com@@ b@@ ying Al@@ di@@ - On@@ ce &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branch off Al@@ di &apos;s rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a sustainability campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di is preparing the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice manufacturers S@@ immo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell approved tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash publishes further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investment strategy day .
there is much on the game as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than the Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern countries .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that after the opening of its first markets Al@@ di will take about five percent of the food market in these two states and take away all the existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retail@@ er could lose 360 $ million revenue per year and cash 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the amounts on Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s high fixed cost base could cost Met@@ cash approximately $ 13 million in profit before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash gains market shares in Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley notes that Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s revenues in food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told Melbourne that Met@@ cash is likely to disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ G@@ AS market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s food and food retailers , which supplies approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction at the same time pressure on sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler def@@ ends and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to compare retail prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh foods and providing a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging renovation programs will be set to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise for his behaviour rather than criticism .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and deserves praise for his own conduct , according to the President of the Australian tennis federation Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , which is repeatedly called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special K@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; got into the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght by the in@@ famous confrontation of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison asser@@ ting : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka had to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he beat a tennis ra@@ cket after a Kra@@ mp@@ f th@@ war@@ ted a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , He@@ aly &apos;s Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty compl@@ aining about is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost for a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player to break a ra@@ cket of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know he &apos;s not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much appreciation .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he has never had a problem with the other players , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained , he &apos;s good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ gios in the important decision that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for everyone but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed part to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ &#93; &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Nick made the climb very fast , which people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to support him with the consequences of his actions . some time out of the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , in which he can only think about it , I think appropriate , and it is best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary states emergency situation , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and negotiated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants arrested in a man &apos;s land , and Ser@@ b officials re@@ acted with indignation .
the people who had fled from violence were stuck in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations began .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ vers over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and scre@@ amed insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some rejected food and water from protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries will take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nation block at a controversial meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually , next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would be made that the EU states would take on more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , did not put his hopes on a bal@@ eful action of Brussels or his neighbors .
the emergency shel@@ tered on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country is planning to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having completed a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to the European Union .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has insist@@ ed that most of the upcoming economic refugees who are looking for a better life , and non @-@ war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws which entered into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or damaging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher prison sentences for condemned human traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very plain@@ ly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament still has to agree on the deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are trying to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday after a train wag@@ gon had arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos passed the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and press a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 managed to arrive , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they can enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s head over Ber@@ nie S@@ anders tried in a national survey
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continue to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins over to the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced that he is can@@ did@@ dic@@ ated for the Pres@@ idency , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by what candidates they will support .
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders earned some profits .
Clinton has a great advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
her support for the men has dropped mark@@ edly , and S@@ anders is only 5 points back .
Clinton &apos;s advantage over 50 years of democratic voters has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level .
Clinton , however , has a great advantage over the senior voters .
last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead over the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries nationwide say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the views are stronger mixed with those currently not supporting Clinton , only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with problems and the ability to vote are also quoted .
since the vice president has a potential for the president &apos;s office in the balance sheet , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
more than half of Clin@@ tons supporters say that Bi@@ den would be far from S@@ anders their second choice .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton is ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that looks at him as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chosen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democ@@ rat voters call for questions about the ability to choose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similarly as last month , no one Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out for these elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important tra@@ its for voters of the prim@@ aries of their party .
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities to be honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den cuts best in hon@@ esty with the three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say this about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe him .
democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ideological in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server will continue to be provided during the term of office as foreign minister , most Democratic voters are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions overall .
but it is another story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only one third is satisfied .
the public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s overall opinion , although 36 percent said that her opinion was wor@@ sen@@ ed by her .
they are princip@@ ally re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views have become worse by Clinton .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them under registered voters overall : only 32 percent view them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of eligible voters do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible voters see also Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
but Clinton and Tr@@ ump get good notes .
out of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush would best cut out hon@@ esty .
a majority considers S@@ anders rather to be honest , but as with Car@@ son , many do not believe him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 demo@@ cra@@ cies in the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches Donald Tr@@ ump next to the nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in charge of the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey behind Donald Tr@@ ump
in the meantime , half of the support of voters in the new survey has dropped to the two candidates , and others lose their support dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . support is growing 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , at 27 % in the Tuesday &apos;s survey .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well in demographic groups and delivers dr@@ um@@ ps under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is kno@@ cked down with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is most pleased with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place at 6 % .
the margin of error in the sample of 3@@ 76 people by Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son is rising in poll@@ s - he lands with 19 % support among the Republi@@ cans , behind the dr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed a dr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
with a view to a Car@@ son ascending last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son dis@@ ap@@ olog@@ ised to question Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperature : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find still warm water .
a bath in North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people do not go to the sea : at a maximum of 18 degrees the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week divi@@ des the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
pool temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the East , it even gets up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic Sea it is 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ bie
nearly two years after a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , a student was married to a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were lod@@ ged against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during an introduc@@ tory ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said he had been bur@@ dened with connected eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target via a frozen field .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about headache , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood didn &apos;t call the 911 emergency number after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital like the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ i &apos;s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and put the good of the Brotherhood in general on that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ ti@@ ff Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after a aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly attached to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs with a bl@@ unt force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies every year since 1970 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ i &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment because of the murder of the third grave for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with religious attacks and formation of a criminal organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ officially - sanc@@ tioned this , so we will also be held ac@@ coun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College prohibited the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed raises interest rates
a rise in interest rates , and the land@@ se is stag@@ gering , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into recession .
we know that .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only a small guide to the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first increase in the interest rate and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial investments are responding .
this is why representatives of the US Central Bank have so v@@ ehem@@ ently pointed out that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of a rise in interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still to a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions .
here is a view based on historical trends , as some areas of the economy might react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the impact is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency for assets to be weigh@@ ed 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which might reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after the F@@ ed interest rate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , in the past 35 years , the market is mostly on the upward trend - roughly 14 percent - on the way to increase interest income , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal condition after 500 days , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a recent analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , Head of System Strate@@ gies at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increases cycle and the return on investment begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic activity , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate the recession .
it is very remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 advertising increases have only twice the nominal GDP to 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue , and for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed expect only 1.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rises in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is it this time different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market players focused the whole year on the interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were focused on the session of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade is only a 25 percent chance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all booster cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and before @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ists very soon after the beginning of recovery in the shadows &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
fixed income was also volati@@ le since the market anticip@@ ates interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on stocks , if they change their strategic course .
in case of bonds the returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / lowering is done in the cycle .
at the end of the increase cycle the bond di@@ apers immediately fall , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to shifting between longer and shorter bonds closer together and leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
what is interesting is that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have increased , yield curve is more flat , credit lines have expanded , and volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market , if the F@@ ed sharp@@ ens their strategy .
in large and complete , businesses that handle the greater part of their business in the United States will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational corporations with high debt are getting worse because rising dollars are making their products more expensive on the global market and financing their debt as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded on average by 5 percentage points after each of the rate increases 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will most lose , Gold@@ man said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
savers are able to see profits by higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says member of Parliament Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised the broad@@ ca@@ ster for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fra@@ ming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able by commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at BBC Music Awards and said they im@@ itated only The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament Col@@ eman Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins res@@ or@@ ted to the show The Voice and said that this is not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , claiming a leading member of parliament and increasing pressure on the station to prove that he does something that the private transm@@ it@@ ters do not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also told the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ish@@ able from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be the Br@@ its only under another name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously named examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ing@@ ham .
BBC director general rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far from its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn from classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I consider the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to commission new works , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that it would be harder to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that was under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the Sel@@ ection of Culture , Media and Sports , to tramp@@ le on commercial ri@@ vals .
T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show purchased by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it isn &apos;t original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George - was produced as a judge - &quot; in particular BBC mode . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he would like the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit out of our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the next time it star@@ ed a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to spend money of the fee tax@@ pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales slow@@ ed down in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the recording began in 2000 .
online sales strengthened three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down expenses
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the on@@ set of records in 2000 , with only five per cent increase over the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for years and go back to 2000 , this has been evolving over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is comm@@ uting and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
experts believe that buyers withdraw their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe Black Friday , on which buyers were fighting for bar@@ gains , could stop buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 was spent more than £ 1 online .
for some products such as TV and washing machines , more than a third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims bury the killed in Mec@@ ca by crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are worn by Muslims at the first funeral in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia lays down the collapse of the huge Saudi bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health told that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mos@@ que .
ber@@ eav@@ ed , dressed mostly in white , the route to declare their respect when the first of the dead started their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ors cemetery .
the funeral procession went past the holy place , where only a few days before , a building crane went through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell on the bed .
the bodies were released for bur@@ ial when the Saudi King sold a sanc@@ tion over the construction company of Bin Laden &apos;s family because of the disaster that also left 3@@ 94 wounded .
the bodies of 29 operators who were killed when a crane pl@@ ung@@ ed through the Great Central mos@@ que of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram came from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane subsi@@ ded .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ lers go on to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today king Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden group should not have stopped the crane arm when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership in foreign travel was prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man had to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which rus@@ hed into an inner courtyard of the Gross@@ mo@@ z@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later this month gathered .
the Bin Laden Group has not published any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also charged the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mos@@ que as part of the massive building project managed by the Bin Laden group .
the bin Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a dec@@ eit@@ ful son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &apos;s .
the fall of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims .
officials said 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials stated that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of lasting injured .
other wounded receive half of this amount .

as a result King@@ fis@@ her plans to open up to 200 additional scre@@ wing shops , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , as eight out of ten purchase decisions are made by women .
at the moment , men predomin@@ ate .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households , which do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a majority of men working in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this to a balance more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a UK leader in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and sales after the group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the shops .
due to the trends King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open up to 200 new branches .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball scor@@ er A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and abor@@ tion on Wednesday at the Kla@@ gen@@ furt State Court .
the def@@ end@@ ants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
he was legally freed from this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , during the preliminary investigation , the def@@ end@@ ants had found out that in 2006 @-@ 2011 the def@@ end@@ ants had money from club accounts that they were allowed to disp@@ ose of in their functions for private purposes .
the damage is estimated to be around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also charged with financial off@@ ences .
this fact was eliminated by the Chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
in the case of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that the association did not come into existence at any point in time .
the sports officials would only have paid expense allow@@ ances and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the Pas@@ si@@ va amounted to some 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; at that time we were standing before the situation : do we continue the club or lock it ? , &quot; said one of the def@@ end@@ ants , the chief inspec@@ tor of the financial office .
he then decided to take over this task with his colleague and co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money to secure our life insurance as security for the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the arrival . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been agreed with the association : you can freely admini@@ ster the money , no debt has to be made .
in the event of a corresponding financial success , the payout of allow@@ ances declined retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , some of the allow@@ ances have been paid out only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was on the account .
as a result , even package deals and non @-@ detail bookings seemed to exist , the former chairman explained the proceedings .
the two accused jointly administered the accounts and accounts , said the second accused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the payments have not been disclosed to the association in detail , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association didn &apos;t care in detail for the financial support , it was important to only have been free of debt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the bank account .
that would have been set@@ backs , the def@@ end@@ ants declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and was not known to the association according to its statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent knew no answer for a long time .
then he said , he believed that this was the best thing for the association .
if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything of that money , the prosec@@ utor represented in the room .
the accused was informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; claims for damage . &quot;
why In@@ dem@@ nity ? , Wan@@ ted and At@@ tor@@ ney wanted to know .
the first accused said that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With him are you all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never paid a cent salary , he only charged Kilomet@@ ers and di@@ ets .
in di@@ ets he charged the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not able to provide accurate documentation for the early years .
these were no longer kept according to an operating test in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
the second def@@ end@@ ant also covered the mil@@ eage .
all the arrangements were made in cash , and he had to go to the Bank from his place of residence to the Bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the main trial will be continued on 23 September with the interview of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard presents another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff cuts that have been running for three years , the computer will reduce further jobs when spl@@ itting the company .
the positions at the US computer terri@@ a Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
within the framework of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its corporate customer segments .
as a result , costs of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the ongoing reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP still employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ share delivered 2.3 percent on the stock market .
the California @-@ based Pal@@ o Alto group is now spl@@ itting up : the computer and print business is to be bund@@ led this year in a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data store for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services put the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer in line with Lenovo .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under US $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
the proceeds returned in 15 out of 16 quarters .

however , a direct participation of German soldiers in hos@@ tilities in Iraq would mainly come to an end : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent cons@@ enting .
the fact that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent outbreak in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police deployed at the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and floo@@ d@@ lights against several hundred displaced refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the breach of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line had formed and a wat@@ cher stood behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the police officers .
the officials first un@@ interrupted the pepper spray .
afterwards the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now withdrawn a little cau@@ ti@@ ously .
a pregnant and apparently injured wife was carried away from the zone .
children , who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried out .
other refugees gathered in themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by using tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world ob@@ serves when the US central bank comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether interest is raised for the first time for almost a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of the opinion was that the F@@ ed will do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain slightly longer and the interest rates at the current level will be 0 @-@ 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest was set to NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero sector and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior employee at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of output , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rocky outlook on global circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a move are good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 20.00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death guard at Delta State University left ap@@ ologies
after firing and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could und@@ o it , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , teacher of ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has shot on a man and killed a man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency department that the police had to send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller about his name , but he did not give it .
Lamb didn &apos;t give any explanation for his shots .
when police looked at the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could und@@ o it .
I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note Lamb carried 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday that Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that they were married about seven years ago , as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were their daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was working online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Know@@ les said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb raised relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , Lamb carried his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a PhD degree from Delta State University in spring 2015 , as his life c@@ law gives on the University &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their lucky charm

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
Lufthansa plans a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organisation .
150 of the roughly 1000 managers worldwide will cost the company restructuring the workplace .
but there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa is building up its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ value Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the re@@ orientation is a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syn@@ ergi@@ es , the airline distributed on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will no longer be a member of the Executive Board for the passenger business .
the alig@@ ning line Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in the management board team headed by Chef Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings .
with the real@@ ignment , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group intends to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120@@ ,000 employees was complex .
the airlines operate under the umbrella of the airline group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict of tari@@ ff with the pilot association Cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations after the court @-@ stri@@ cken strike on this Thursday shall be resum@@ ed .
this was shared by the union .
the theme of the discussions will be the retirement provision for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one year , cockpit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wishes to come to viable results as soon as possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between trade union and airline has led to a number of strikes over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots the wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is provided . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United cannot play for months because of double frac@@ tures
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven a double frac@@ ture of his right leg .
while this caused the left external defender to cry and exclu@@ des him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al gives the hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w had broken into the PS@@ V range .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said van Ga@@ al : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a dual leg structure and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy coming with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed lucky to be able to escape a Red Card and Sus@@ pension of an El@@ f@@ dom .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ w &apos;s account said , &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related to : Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the UK Defender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a very serious injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was on the way in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard this can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .

surely David Cameron has better known The Lor@@ ax ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the prime minister decided for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental label published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on Super@@ Camp@@ s website , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my kids , as it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron apparently describes the story of the book , instead re@@ prints a table of contents for the 2012 film version that added new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; amid the walled city of Th@@ urn @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree , &quot; he reads .
as if that would not be suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads partially like a summary of the lau@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ urn @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to being a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here an unknown boy hears , as the local environment fal@@ si@@ fies through the gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ tering , the need of kn@@ itting On@@ ce @-@ ler , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; devast@@ ated by the name of the trees .
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row after a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street speaker said that the text was probably come from Camer@@ ons Wahl@@ ro@@ büro .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
to hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a forward victory .
A@@ last@@ air Cook &apos;s site might be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali developed as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
referring to this message : Adam Ly@@ th emerges from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyse .
during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to nom@@ ination , there - and I have said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , the course of Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control over his own fate .
hopefully when he kno@@ cks out other Yor@@ k@@ shire legs , there &apos;s another chance .
the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude even if he did not get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is mainly a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test man gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and abroad .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first deployed Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a drummer , whom I set up high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he finished 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very well .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of letting mos@@ ques hit next to Cook , which would give an extra spin @-@ punch and get four squ@@ e@@ aks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s cra@@ p of cri@@ cket @-@ player .
mos@@ ques might not have done his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred re@@ inde@@ er straight away and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes into the cad@@ re as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he really impressed me as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it is a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has made some clever additions to the coaching .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experience , as he played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing room , even if the messages are in line with what is said before .
Coll@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ &apos;s , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy @-@ hear@@ ted .

David Cameron &apos;s un@@ fer@@ mented ne@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to hold Britain in the EU will get deeper every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which sharply conflic@@ ted on Tuesday because of Europe .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at boy@@ friend recently said that some member states are deeply involved in different crises , as the EU is now and not always on its own fault , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes , which they mostly do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it even if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Ministers climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wants an outside Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets you see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it happened in the exagger@@ ated long @-@ term ends like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande is looking at his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland might soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist one .
it is difficult to imagine that they will be pulled out to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its whose energy should be better used for preventing Scotland from coming out of the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
so perhaps some such ministers may deliberately not plan helpful comments , entirely in SN@@ P style , during the UK &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of its ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be at its expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press @-@ zone , as they were not during the 1975 referendum , inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made a name for themselves as a &quot; EU straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 1990s .
with all his amaz@@ ement , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone h@@ ack@@ ering foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ ali@@ ens , most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar about her , but realized that if you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you &apos;d better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , for Bla@@ ir had opposed the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened his door to him .
the press has never denied it .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly fl@@ aps on his back on Monday in Westminster , told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 1980s , a mistake then and today .
it can last but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position to Europe is - I press it friendly - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional ble@@ dy@@ e tendency and wild combat of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary was saying &quot; A Ben@@ n , but not Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week , when the boy sc@@ outs in him fought not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be very loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ i &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C talked to his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports at their conference on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the era of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe who allows him to maintain Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks like that .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic ambig@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in accordance with their Benn@@ ite Bel@@ Siege @-@ economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ity to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if it can be all sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday of something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called itself .
experts critici@@ ze Public Health UK &apos;s report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ising the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Ide@@ as Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy foundation &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people conven@@ ed in order to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) in order to develop their opinions on the damages of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , managing director of British American Tob@@ acco Control ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funding from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the financing it was supposed to have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not delivered , but this includes several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco management of P@@ he took part in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not@@ orious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence of most products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or restrictions in the P@@ it report will be discussed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; premature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that the alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J had already been re@@ acted earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are far less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies on his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low in comparison , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
he has the un@@ ambig@@ uous duty to inform the public about what evidence is evidence and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people die every year on a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by revealing recent evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ ender , says former Chief of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programmes such as East@@ ers and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows such as the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to do the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public broad@@ casts that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ it@@ ters like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years at his time at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broad@@ cast@@ ed , which would be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee in his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t think for a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least put its production on programs that others do not do or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is non@@ sense of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ers is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I would like to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series directing Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC &apos;s fault in hunting for reviews is &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are what the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that BBC shows like East@@ ers should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs &quot; go to BB@@ C4 where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue , if they go on their apparently sacred missions to justify a £ 4 billion radio license , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window , in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you think all of us think that for £ 150 per year you get a great value , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday demanded that the BBC review their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ thi@@ an mission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to inform , train and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it is 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example to the public broad@@ ca@@ ster broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a handful of TV are shown , and with the commercial broad@@ ca@@ ster alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in which they are be@@ amed with sound pulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels responding to ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said to the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to people &apos;s brain to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
fil@@ ament@@ alists usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani indicated that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which penetrate the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the stran@@ gl@@ ers .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons wear TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultrasound to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transmitted to the worms , where they turn on the modified mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the method has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics might have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which has to be sent down to the desired position in the brain in an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ onic waves can pass un@@ checked and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that gene therapy and a therapeutic virus are able to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultras@@ onic signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are visible at bus stops and underground trains , requiring a second look .
&quot; important announcement : take the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Dock@@ lands Light Railway ) from September 15 to 18 in the font types of the London Under@@ ground and the trademarks of the DL@@ R line that turns into a tank .
in September there will be a s@@ warm of arms traders with the DL@@ R ... Customers are asked to help at the stop of the arms fair .
the 300 posters are of artists who have exhibited their work at the museum for cruel designs in Ban@@ sys D@@ ism@@ aland .
a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped in the distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a £ 6 Pack of Allen keys claiming that &quot; access to about one @-@ third of the bus stops on the planet &quot; gains . &quot;

after Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will become more critical and try to bring political work to the public outside galleries .
many artists engage with activists in protest movements to work and notice that they must go outside into the real world , so that their art has an impact on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters gre@@ ets commuters in the subway .
the am@@ ne@@ sty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ eover artist , who also works for free .
V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that reigned around the advertising for the arms fair - through a leadership of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic tender company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blu@@ ish with bright colors and animation keeps it stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture instruments at the trade fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Am@@ ne@@ sty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is the intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the ce@@ ase@@ fire comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L where exhibitors are fantas@@ tically swe@@ eping eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ful ninet@@ een @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now do I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed into eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly annoying up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to sni@@ ff : people tell where you come from , whether and where you &apos;ve taken Sab@@ bat@@ ane , where you are standing in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you frank@@ ly don &apos;t love nor hate , because seriously , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract , ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like unlike those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes were burned in fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers .
let people live .
people &apos;s rooms often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people wear themselves and tear off their under@@ wear .
referring to this : don &apos;t forget to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ vert will receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ room @-@ room @-@ stroll @-@ culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to sense when a milit@@ ant of con@@ vivi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him a text message instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship through baking .
as you start the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people to imagine with a plate of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I baked something for you . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and at the end will perhaps associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you &apos;re a decent b@@ aker .
bad mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to drop in when you kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check that with the owner of the milk .
chances are good that they say they are serving themselves , even when they cook in the interior .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a dish@@ washing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse in the true sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbors , if it was a matter of making drum &amp; bass a little qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had an examination in the morning .
they responded with more listening to music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before leaving their own music , shut down their door and went to their three hour test .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would fall into the same residence in the same residence ?
conver@@ sely , if you keep a room@@ mate for your future spouse , go to her , dis@@ connect herself and then see her each day and perhaps witness how she moves all together friends to himself ?
of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot co @-@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to speak to your subordin@@ ate a little reason .
in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has his keys lying in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ cer and mo@@ b@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good st@@ unt is funny , but it takes only moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never mind one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but stap@@ le your possessions on the ceiling more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single educ@@ ators , low @-@ ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ deb@@ tor builds in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental town@@ houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living room but also the mother and the ear@@ thy servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how you can build better and well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are displaced to the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ deb@@ tor thinks to know how fast affordable housing can be created : he builds in a project Tow@@ n@@ house for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ deb@@ tor , many refugees rus@@ hed to the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people stay here for a great deal .
in view of the flow of refugees , we need sufficient living space in the next few decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs less space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if one puts people in blocks .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
guil@@ d : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
do the building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : legally , I went through my project correctly .
especially complicated it always makes the men@@ ac@@ ing Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the Stell@@ platz@@ Regulation .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under construction , who in a row house creates three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place missing .
and asylum seek@@ ers don &apos;t have cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ deb@@ tor : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
which is definitely not true .

iOS 9 : how to Get the New iPhone Operating System when Apple Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings @-@ App , to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message telling you that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update has failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush returns or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely due to the stream@@ lining of the update . likewise , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , because the phone might turn off half way and this may result in a crash of the update .

Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ bure@@ au searches for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ it@@ ften have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new location at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
in addition to consultations you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely , the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the purchasing market , sen@@ iors and advis@@ ors receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or health care insurance benefits .
for years we have been diagnosed with our ambul@@ ant care service that often nur@@ turing relatives are left alone .
there are so many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though the complexity of the insurance companies is scar@@ c@@ ely understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new owner J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ sti@@ ft and the Bürger@@ sp@@ ital as well as for the ambul@@ atory service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapy treatment can therefore be used .
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis ideally complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis is responsible for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both business leaders see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre in particular in demographic change .
this is because it is essential to make a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
moreover , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , dedic@@ ating himself to the office of the district at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able get @-@ together . &quot;
in doing so , the social fund makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well @-@ beha@@ ved as possible in their familiar environment .

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang passed the age of 92
Karl M@@ ang , one of the do@@ yen of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus wed@@ ded on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang the Künstler@@ haus awarded an honorary member and at the same time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important architects in the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was said in the broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
born 1922 in Vienna , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna near Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect , but has also worked as a teacher , writer and institute director .
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design .
in the eigh@@ ties he was charged with the establishment of the Treas@@ ury in the Hof@@ burg of Vienna and the reconstruction of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum .

according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .
intellec@@ tually he has not committed himself intellec@@ tually .
Wiese had just cut the hair in the inner city , when he saw a parking space wat@@ cher out there for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
Wiese then ran out of the business , insul@@ ted the official and repro@@ ached her for the fine fine @-@ penalty in front of his feet , as reported as the &quot; picture &quot; newspaper .
with the city of Bremen one confirms the alleg@@ ations , but is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only then will it be decided whether a meadow will be displayed or not .

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses sought the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time , the group was at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station .
there were also three persons on the grounds of the gas station .
one of these men now scre@@ amed the young man and struck him with his fist .
the victim suffered from no@@ stri@@ ls and was bleeding heavily from his nose .
when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator pursued the group with a car up to their apartment and drove past several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured man went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male .
under the aid of a head@@ stock it was possible to examine the face and th@@ igh of the victim .
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
up to now only a vag@@ ue perpet@@ ual description lies ahead .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
the second ra@@ cket was about 1.@@ 65 meters in size and was dressed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police asks witnesses and advis@@ ers to report to the telephone number 0@@ 6@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over the field of Fel@@ lows and inv@@ ests € 3@@ 10@@ 000
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ go@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gel@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ an U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs , mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased about this .
in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing luck : there Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of Fel@@ ce@@ ausen on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gel@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich succe@@ eds in his successor in the next few months still with half a passage .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the office on 12 October , until then he inv@@ ests € 3@@ 10@@ 000 in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ u@@ straße 6 .
it was sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic at first sight when the ri@@ ms appeared years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ go@@ l , who is currently completing their specialist training in the Ver@@ den hospital and who wants to enter the practice year after year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mill@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gel@@ horn and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was ready , I simply called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea was to pursue its own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and support families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he also sees to be his own boss .
and so one agreed that the mill@@ ers bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank Müller also grew up there , his medical studies in Hannover followed in several doctor &apos;s offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen and in 2009 he was appointed a senior physician in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged in voluntary work in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness Rad@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of 19 September , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ gel@@ ausen operates as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mill@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as general practitioners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ go@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and loading EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
the ED@@ V is also completely renewed .
a total of 50@@ 000 Euros will be donated to the rub@@ b@@ ish in the framework of a subsi@@ dy programme from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses Mr@@ s Mr@@ s Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ go@@ l , approximately 2000 patients come to the field of Fel@@ ce@@ au each quarter , in the north German average practice there are about 500 patients .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s office .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gel@@ ausen , the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor had been found , it would have gone too .
by the way , anyone who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hour also continues to look into familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the ri@@ ms .
with their f@@ arewell in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the medical professionals have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Ur@@ sel &apos;s fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly they already feel after a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ lo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their husband compl@@ ements : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself against gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pair also has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are going on at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum application can make this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the focus is on the care and safety of the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it should also be clear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Minister said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept unlimited mig@@ rat@@ ory flows , not even the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia was@@ hes away &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would leave incoming refugees to Austria and Germany and also set up cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
this was not the case , however , that Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia , however , is already strongly controlled as the outside border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia doesn &apos;t want to seal its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system won &apos;t work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ no@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government ha@@ st@@ ened , the first refugees had already attempted to cross the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia to avoid registration .
the c@@ roati@@ an police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly hit by the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days his country will be counting around 4,000 refugees , Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which had brought immigrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted towards Croatia , dis@@ connected Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was it that people approach certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; she said .
according to media reports , a first bus with some 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of S@@ id had arrived in the morning . in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
over Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers were travelling all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border that was approximately 500 kilometres away through Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary closed , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually lead to a postpon@@ ement of the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west distance .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control possibilities &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister , Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic , had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not mention details but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 . since then , the EU partners have consistently issued a good certificate regarding the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , there are still around 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees want to go on to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Minister of Interior , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm down Wednesday morning at a local presence in Hor@@ gos . he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is closed now , for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not currently deal with very high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not say whether they would continue their trip to Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun distributing maps on which alternative routes are drawn by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border region , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared mine fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .

Sup@@ ran@@ s@@ ok should have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals , accused of having gained access to un@@ published financial statements and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ Square and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the captured information , insi@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business transactions have been made in the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , a total of over 100 million dollars were reported to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are ultimately caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the processes against 32 further accused in the case continued .
most of the accused come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators are to be active in both the US and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .

you control the two stations of the Mannheim aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep the city paths .
puls@@ ating , pr@@ alles life with a wonderful autumn sun and in the middle there are four large tables in each case with the heading &quot; Before I die ... &quot;
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce re@@ port@@ edly drew attention to its 20th anniversary with this action and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Help is available to the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by as well as for questions and conversations as the volunteers .
while some p@@ asser @-@ by interven@@ es spontaneously to the chal@@ k and affir@@ ms the sentence &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; read the war &quot; or &quot; don &apos;t suffer long , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; I &apos;m not so far , &quot; and then go on .
again and again little discussions about the action are developing , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that at some point the end of this world comes to me , I can live ir@@ responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the di@@ ac@@ onal work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ itas association bearer of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the fact that not everyone wants to share information on the tablets is understandable , but finally it is a very personal matter .
the subject of death and death is still alive with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of the people .
an assessment that An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid shares .
the death and mour@@ ning atten@@ dant is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted with personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ illa searched for volunteers by calling , she immediately reported to herself and had been part of the founding in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private homes , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Sankt Vincent .
all are carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can work well with her job and the experiences and experiences made thereby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another war@@ es , hold it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations allows the training as well as training and supervision of the death and funeral atten@@ d@@ ants .
training for new employees is offered every two years .
the tablets described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
additional personal wishes can also be recorded on post@@ cards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply giant lowered its earnings outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its transportation service .
the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous predic@@ tion .

the lower view comes despite the increase in price , which is an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and is effective on January 4 and despite higher rainf@@ all for heavy and large packages , which will be raised in November .
the company said it nevertheless expected the result to be increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and because of growth in online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company achieves &quot; solid yields if one considers the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
plans for vacation pre@@ occupation were announced one day later than that of the rival UPS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which analysts predicted twelve by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales increased 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of the analysts requested analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a drop in international priority shipping which brought sales in its unit express shipment to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
express unit reported higher earnings due to higher prices , while earnings declined due to higher labor costs in freight business .
in the after@@ market trade , about one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it is time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States is threatening above them at an end of the decorated two @-@ story cour@@ t@@ room .
the card is a reminder that F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold mission from Congress : keeping US jobs and prices stable here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by the unprecedented incentive by the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data on the economy show that it is growing solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxi@@ ous to increase this volati@@ lity by raising interest on federal loans - and even by a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text not to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which in itself sec@@ ures the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an interest rate this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the financial markets expect a wait of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the sentence unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts allevi@@ ate the blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage rose by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy will sustain the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the pro@@ positions at that time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm down the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a interest rate would so@@ o@@ the the financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required to increase the sentence .
although the job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed considers as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world gathered at the end of last month after China had depreci@@ ated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average figure fell by more than 16 % below its peak in May when investors feared that slow@@ ing down the Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ tle global growth .
the market has recovered somewhat this month , with the D@@ ow now nearly 10 % below the top of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and news of the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred over the past few weeks , they would put on re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US Central Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to better get a grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision making process .
but in the end the F@@ ed has become the monetary authority of the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere hint of the then leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her monetary expansion , triggered confusion around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives can expect them not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also to advise other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ier , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noticed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements , which apparently are not linked to the economic fundam@@ entals . &quot;
Lack@@ ier , right @-@ wing member of the Federal Open Market Committee , is committed to raise interest , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; despite a limited recogni@@ ze@@ able impact on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives did reverse these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate decision .
the most recent turbul@@ ences come not near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation where she is afraid of interest , because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poz@@ nan , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is amended , I do not think that it should be ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little Life Assistance for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees are coming to Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome does not work without the involvement of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , too , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine are among them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach her 74 scores .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seek@@ er home on D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
there it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , all of the other classes are at the right school .
Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to enligh@@ ten women on how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . she does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary modification that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet in pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese Sports Hall
the municipal council of Bern@@ ried approved the construction permit for the 2.3 million Euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn of the sports hall on the Bern@@ ese Mountain grounds is progres@@ sing step by step : in the latest municipal council meeting , the elabor@@ ated construction proposal was unanim@@ ously approved .
previously , among other things , the board had decided to apply for a structural &quot; exception &quot; and &quot; deliver@@ ance &quot; from the valid building plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was given permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ central first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be constructed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems is in the background : &quot; this brings us together a wonderfully large south @-@ roof , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
in the &quot; liberation &quot; it was again the pitch of the roof , which for energetic reasons - unlike the building plan stipul@@ ates - should lie below ten degrees .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan regarding the pitch does not allow any &quot; exceptions , &quot; although Bern@@ ese &apos;s municipal council is usually rather restric@@ tive in the case of exemp@@ tion orders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is no recur@@ rent project in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Turn@@ halle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sports centre at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
approximately 2.3 million euros are calculated at cost .
grants are expected from school and mass transport .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be presented to the Land@@ rats@@ amt for testing .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is planned to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of the staff moved from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this presents the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , where the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß confirmed .
however , a decision on this decision will be made by the Supervisory Board , and the decision will be postpon@@ ed on Wednesday , 23 September .
if plans are to be implemented , then all of the 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue to work .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the still existing internal station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the staff will be informed of the plans .
the change has triggered Dr. Andreas E@@ der &apos;s termination , which has only been Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fis@@ her@@ man &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who declared himself ready to take over the lead from October 1 , came to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means &quot; upgrading &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the field of internal medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the inside of gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , Fischer will be working with his team if the supervisory board agrees to the two houses , until next year the former hospital of the squ@@ ad , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
so far , the county has planned this for 2018 , when the current refur@@ bish@@ ment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital has been completed .
J@@ och@@ ner White , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , submitted rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the Swiss squ@@ ad , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum @-@ seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shut it off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer on the quasi moving to the Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years , has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened by closure over the past few decades , det@@ ach@@ ments have been closed , such as surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ bags of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Leu@@ ven are called for the Berg@@ ische HC tonight ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) .
although the ranking leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , there is no reason for arro@@ gan@@ ce .
in the past season , the Ba@@ ener ordered a painful defeat at Bh@@ c and had a good chance of doing something there .
Jag@@ ha@@ hood with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during the ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ gation on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district of Witt@@ enberg ) , several h@@ unters were in action as the police informed .
a 63 and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were transported to hospitals .
it was not clear how accurate it could come to the accident .
the criminal police investigated .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of crimes of violence
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate for Saturday .
in inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their bodies were thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to a crime of violence .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , like prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was arrested on Tuesday evening , is also deemed to be active , who stated the fact that the investig@@ ator was in charge of the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ ses .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after having come home on the eve after a visit of an Aut@@ umn Festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
when searching for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first launched the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
in the case of inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the body was found .
according to the authorities , the authorities reported in the police inter@@ ro@@ gation the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and laid the cor@@ p@@ ses in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the hop@@ per on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a tot@@ ter on him .
the further investigation should be brought about the near@@ er circumstances of the act .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees seek a paid lead .
the pressure on the housing market is increasing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution cont@@ ests in the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the arriving refugees and job seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is now over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low income citizens over the last affordable housing .
in order to meet demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Res@@ idential Building &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; programme is commissioned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
thus 14@@ 0,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
refugees are no longer required after the first three months of their stay to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation .
many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office last year , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to increasing numbers of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a housing deficit which will grow from year to year .
currently , around 77@@ 0,000 units of housing were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in big cities in need of flat @-@ share rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained un@@ willingly in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the vac@@ ancy in the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has fallen for the first time over the past few years .
in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social housing construction &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
in doing so , new incentives should boost the social housing construction again .
this could be om@@ itted on the basic income tax and the property tax for subsidi@@ zed homes can be subject to a limited time .
in addition , attractive tax depreciation facilities are necessary according to the Alliance .
the support programme for the refugee camps of the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available 300 million euros has already been rec@@ alled on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
now the project could even be raised .
refugees have a free understanding : Croatia and Slovenia point to a corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is practically no escape to Hungary , as more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb announces passing through Slovenia to the North without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to Slovenian Minister of the Interior , and if necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and belongs to the Schengen zone .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the destruction of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television channel RT@@ L reports .
Hungary had closed its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws that came into effect on the same day , moreover , do not obvi@@ ate the need for proper asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic declared , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can travel through , and we prepare ourselves for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police took up the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia .
most of the media reports are from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came to the Serbian border town of S@@ id both by bus and taxis .
immediately after their arrival they had tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come to the border fence .
for this the border strip hi@@ des other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 90@@ s .
mine clearance must now quickly create a safe passage .
however , after the closure of the border , hardly any more refugees arrive to Hungary .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 .
shortly before the decision on Monday , it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws are committed to overcoming and damaging the border dispute as a crime .
therefore 35 p@@ uni@@ tive proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungary border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years of imprisonment and expul@@ sion from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were submitted to the newly established &quot; transit zones &quot; on Tuesday , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
under the applicant are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there would have been 40 refugees there .
practically nobody has a chance to get asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to ti@@ dy up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected garbage , which had left tens of thousands of people in the last weeks at the road@@ side .
locking grids have been disman@@ tled and one of the recor@@ ders in the border area has been reconstructed .
no one wanted to express themselves to the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is reaching only a few refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but around 20,000 migrants still remained in the country according to government figures .
in Salzburg around 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , there were regularly smaller groups of refugees arriving on foot .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday with the clearing as suddenly ten people with travel agents were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins , mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to take the train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria because of the flow of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the frames along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we first oc@@ cured the unexpected guests , with snacks and drinks .
we said right away , we take them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man could not take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers had moved from an ICE train to a regional train towards Passa@@ u on Sunday evening in order to make it possible after the announcement that rail traffic was set to Germany , but to try to cross the border .
the regional train was placed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest linked with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , day before a second brid@@ ge@@ start sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately to establish structures that ensure humanitarian , our German Chancellor has publicly and publicly enjoyed the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ circle of National Socialism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now facing chao@@ tic conditions in the border regions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also notice that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge to make decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers in view of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad looking for 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ festivals
Konrad , with the incorpor@@ ation of refugees , has to do all his hands full .
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
the government has deployed the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ ban@@ ker to set up lod@@ g@@ ings for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos at the first recording centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the placing of the 20,000 refugees , who had come to Austria on Monday , was also without great vor@@ tices , Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; master power . &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
Konrad will reck@@ on with a demand of 85@@ ,000 Quar@@ ters in the he@@ ur@@ ful year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations will still have to be found in the next weeks - 20,000 are to provide the Länder , 15,000 of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is no barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the Gover@@ nor .
they would have assured him of creating districts for the coming refugees too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria things are going well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ar supports Konrad .
tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , thereby clari@@ fying how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen like us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private persons can offer un@@ complicated accommodations .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that lod@@ g@@ ings have to keep a certain height of the towel rack or the size of the harmon@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a limited time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , Konrad gro@@ unded with his experience .
I am an older gent@@ leman , whom one does not say without further into the face the un@@ truth .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not charge the republic as they themselves explained .
they want to increase the number of employees to three to four .
the own quest for neighbourhood was not successful so far .
Konrad wanted to place a container at Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with hom@@ olog@@ ation .
Linz demands a better distribution
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the housing of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as we are currently unable to accommodate those affected without these measures , &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
in case of emergency , however , further locations should be checked for their suitability .
the city chief critic@@ ises the division of the refugees inside the federal state .
other districts must also contribute here .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders will not be sealed &quot;
in a lengthy telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday called for further action in the refugee issue .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be sealed .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
for the time being , there will be no more special deals with refugees in Germany .
however , the asylum seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue once more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria now also introduces new controls to its borders is a logical consequence for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the German approach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrie@@ gebiet is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly tra@@ ded IT Group has moved into S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in startup companies in the New Shi@@ py@@ ard , and later also to acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - Som@@ e@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ propriet@@ or opened second store in the ar@@ cade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the centre of attention in the new shop .
actually J@@ utta Br@@ ing wanted to get a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ aden : after all , she has grown in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have long thought about whether I should open a store , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among other things , the decision was that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own site , where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Region of Linz that sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots .
her fashion @-@ interest has come from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I like most if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women come into rap@@ ture at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , the professional woman cannot answer with the last security .
maybe it &apos;s up to the fact that a nice bag enhances any outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are named An@@ ders .
this property also joins the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for set@@ ters .
whether he expresses himself hostile to journalists , as regards journalists or reveals knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. pres@@ idency un@@ rav@@ els the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cut off well .
this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ onic K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the fo@@ al fres@@ co@@ es is a term many in the wine village on the wine road .
some in the 1200 inhabitants village is related to it over nin@@ ety corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ stadt Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it exciting somehow , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; Sim@@ one Wen@@ del says .
the native K@@ all@@ stadt has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , including Tr@@ ump and the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) Tr@@ ump , which is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also speaks to words - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , there is also a tendency to think that Tr@@ ump is already a bit &apos; a big mouth &apos; , says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within a radius , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - to High German : the An@@ ders , she says .
now Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the An@@ ders .
the story of Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and a ta@@ vern for gold dig@@ gers was opened in the USA .
the foundation of the real estate company was the first real estate purchase in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their home in the long run failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time .
he had not accepted Tr@@ ump because he once was cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ onic History and People &apos;s Do@@ gs , Roland Paul , declared the start of the movie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the USA and demanded the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ ite , this is not so sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement rather dis@@ soci@@ ates the American , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so batter@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never cared for K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a descend@@ ant of the family Heinz came to the church organ during a visit , which was generally good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine that Donald Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he doesn &apos;t make the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe even without the president of Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for whom Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , also in the USA , interest is awakening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau with Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain @-@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the D@@ oric Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report subsequently to the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the reviews on Today .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the capital of the state when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull aboli@@ shed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sunrise , with the pres@@ enters David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Niag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the Ab@@ stance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as Sunrise achieved an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 viewers in the five major cities compared with today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today , a slight increase against the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today has closed the gap to Sunrise in the past few months .
in August , Today , the average reached 3@@ 18.@@ 000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the interval ran@@ ged between 40,000 and 50,000 .
until now in September , Sunrise with an average of 34@@ 9.@@ 000 viewers will be at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently swe@@ ated father , who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics had asked if Thom@@ son could carry a hit @-@ show solo without Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of last night responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and struck slightly The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new quiz show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e , revealed an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half @-@ hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 people and 7@@ 20,000 during the second half hour .
hot @-@ Se@@ at an average of 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of The Ch@@ ase Australia &apos;s second evening will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ se@@ at will ultimately prevail around 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ ride Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
revealed mystery ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor , was wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows the day before three of them checked , you might have accidentally given a clu@@ e to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood sealed his lips until the final on Thursday
all three women have ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is posed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their answers could become a game of corruption , who won the hearts of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called them both fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly set on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked , whom wood should choose , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .
originally released as Sarah &apos;s first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a clever decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ nes for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a lack , as did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by league converting in his first punch return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a Pun@@ t @-@ Return and also into the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team by the mill he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly supported Hay@@ nes in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ nes was also encouraged by special team co @-@ ordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it certainly wasn &apos;t the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian band had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
after the F@@ um@@ ble , Hay@@ nes left the playground and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens once , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ nes compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut back then in 2007 , when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the Free voters are demanding the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees .
party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ bling warned at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Symphony in big Wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to protect schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ bling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get gra@@ dations in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free voters runs down to fri@@ day in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
actually , quite different main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now also dominated by the Free elec@@ torate @-@ meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the exam , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ bling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ai@@ ra@@ ger called for the establishment of UN Prot@@ ected Are@@ as for Refu@@ ge@@ es in Syria , as existed during the war in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore Ai@@ bling also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ bling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need nationwide uniform standards of the federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria moves away , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to become more efficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a long @-@ standing burner remains on the agenda : education policy .
for the new school year , Culture Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot trial &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus , &quot; on 47 high schools , where an extension of the secondary school age is tested for three to four years - as a result , it takes nine years to finish secondary school .
but that doesn &apos;t go far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all high schools wanting to do that .

stronger Wall Street helps D@@ ax jump on the jumps
the German stock market has closed trend @-@ setting and nervous trading history with profits after a long distance .
only in the afternoon was a strong pr@@ el@@ ude to the US stock markets for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points .
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized value was 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points .

solid profits also earned the commercial spots in London and Paris .
in the US , the D@@ ow Jones Index did last approximately 1 percent in Plus .
many stock markets expect markets to be replaced on this Friday until after the interest decision in the United States and also for the large decline in the fut@@ ures market .
the discussion about the loads from nuclear phase @-@ out has pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low and left its mark on E@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the German energy companies probably lack 30 billion euros of provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the federal government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately lost 3.8 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
on the D@@ ax summit , Infin@@ eon shares increased by another 3.@@ 22 percent .
according to a dealer , a positive report from the US magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; produced a positive report from the weekend .
at present , investors therefore paid little attention to the German chip manufacturer .
investment in promising wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August more cars were sold off than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .

4 people killed after police shoot rubber stories on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber stories into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , ruling district administrator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and incen@@ diary bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before it res@@ or@@ ted on rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the deployed rubber stories , known to be able to kill , but are traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last week of violent protests in N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ onn@@ i say that new provinces being formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of V@@ arus , who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
working on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the Constitutional Court in Kath@@ mandu and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Old Post is to be re @-@ built .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 m2 area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there is still no concrete offer .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den City wants to market an area around 4000 square meters in a direct neighbourhood to the Alte Post youth centre .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
you are waiting for appropriate offers , that is to say it from the city .
the investor &apos;s question is not yet clear .
correspon@@ dingly , no contracts had been concluded .
the town of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner of the Great Street , just a few months ago and the building on it had to be torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
a number of residents are further wor@@ rying - they fear the sale of their leisure agent
for months , closed doors were negotiated , deb@@ ated , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday settlement near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prospective , medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the development committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP group , which accused the investors and administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends from the system &apos;s building management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the ten to twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months .
violent reactions among marine owners , who had come to the meeting , highlighted the pictures and new details of the hotel building .
Roberto Schulz , the owner of the sea and a member of the board at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ gli@@ eger , pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a giant ring that domin@@ ates all the other buildings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears like a number of other project critics , that the traffic would greatly increase due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all of the bus @-@ loads must come so that it pays off &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what happens exactly on the estate of a large area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the construction plans are still variable .

Google starts dup@@ lication donation campaign to earn $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help the thousands of refugees who over@@ roll the European nations because they are fle@@ eing from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announc@@ ing the raise of donations in his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who had fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark rail and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants , including Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / can be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many escaped from the war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for obes@@ e diab@@ e@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery .
weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity surgery has proven to be efficient for type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I above 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital submitted data collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c schi@@ zophren@@ ia - medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this surgery decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of fifth year in this study .
meanwhile BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments roughly equal to 29 .
among those undergoing surgical intervention , 36 % dis@@ b@@ anded the diabetes disorder and at 28 % in some cases .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was completely dis@@ b@@ anded in only one percent , partly with only about two percent .
in addition , the results were better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L Cholester@@ ins &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood glucose level in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c dropped by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , so the head scientist Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rek@@ tom@@ ie group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater responses in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 versus 5.1 ) and h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3,@@ 1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported rather a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of severe people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was among obes@@ e people who underwent an obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I of 35 interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point in this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long until we get people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the Hun@@ sr@@ ück
it is a topic that is being increasingly observ@@ able in the fiction scene : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ attractive at school times , meets after years the s@@ warm of her youth , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting especially for Hun@@ sr@@ ück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could set up a literary memorial to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide called for an end to the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the continuing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which dedic@@ ates itself to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis ad@@ mira@@ bly is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the Dalai Lama ass@@ praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; addressing several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a real peace and real development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries can be created , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we have to think about how killing is reduced in their countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never resolved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and found that the violent reaction of the US with@@ drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of intake of hand dis@@ infection products by children in the last 4 years
poison control centres in the US report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , which swal@@ low strongly alcoholic palm disinf@@ ect@@ ants , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , cases of income from hand dis@@ infection in children under 12 years , reporting the poison control centres , rose from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said some children deliberately drink disinf@@ ect@@ ant while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation among social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink dis@@ infection only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of the disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very attractive to children .
hanging disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few sp@@ atter can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , especially for small children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison center at the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the transmitter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people let this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when kids come to it then it &apos;s a quick way to consume plenty of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , recently taken four sp@@ lashes from a straw@@ berry smell of san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer at school , was put in a emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that was illegal in an adult than drunk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the W@@ inn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ ja lam@@ ented her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had pushed her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ infection books and store hand dis@@ infection products outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women were killed in Ontario women after the swal@@ lowing of hands dis@@ infection , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; brick &quot; teacher by placing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand dis@@ infection and ban@@ ishes it from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the disgu@@ ised plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ atter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and dis@@ missed disciplinary action against the school authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic because there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they don &apos;t show any highlights of Cel@@ tic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because the R@@ angers aren &apos;t there .
people here talk not only about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what interests them .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , Dei@@ la swe@@ ars .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Cel@@ tic has to fight , but the Norwegian chef sw@@ amps to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the following ex@@ cre@@ tion from the Champions League , the defeat against ten men arose from Aber@@ deen , who now stand promin@@ ently at the top of the table with five points ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic already had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that exactly like that - but we have to go on .
we really need Cel@@ tic support because that makes the players better .
to stand together now is so important .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the temp@@ est , and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Cel@@ tic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tann@@ adi@@ ce Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that the management team of Dun@@ dee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but admit that the down@@ fall must end on the field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;ll get the guys back on track again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ attractive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen was desper@@ ately needed to fight against Hamilton Heights to see a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a lead of five points ahead of Cel@@ tic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ xi@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won all , in trop@@ hi@@ es or le@@ agues , which games of this kind have won &apos;t win . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the United Kingdom it is rising .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the National Statisti@@ cal Office ( O@@ NS ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure exceeding the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I am witness@@ ing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a viewer gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed through the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation was for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day approached , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and as more applications are available as places , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery is taking place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media spaces from 12 to five .
who is selected , will observe it emo@@ tionally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we talk .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma acc@@ uses me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you will get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she acknowledged that she could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better form@@ ulate her &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
if he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter at the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please check the series of Pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure there &apos;s not enough evidence to justify a death sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters to whom you can turn to it .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
man after damp police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he talked about the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang down the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few metres away from a police officer trying to &quot; gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was called on Tuesday for a fall arrest incident in Becken@@ ham .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of Cann@@ ing River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negotiated . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
Championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ in drove his car to the dit@@ ch to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ in bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and thre@@ aten to finish racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she carried out a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt tu@@ ft test at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had with@@ held himself 18 months because of the sp@@ ying alleg@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that it all comes out once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know it went on .
sometimes you respond and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I have said .
tonight I will go home and sleep well .
I would like to walk up@@ lifted and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had let go of the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed to believe me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ dy , acting president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today .
should this bring me to the view that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly attitude and perhaps makes people outside trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now about to think about it .
but I &apos;ve arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ stration levels of the trainer have built up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt research , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a package of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I must take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously put mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so last night .
it could have been so yesterday all day , which was so .
but it had it so on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an examination of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
man arrested after driver &apos;s flight
on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycli@@ st and a subsequent driver cur@@ tail in Cob@@ ram .
the cycli@@ st was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries , after being hit by a car on Saturday morning at the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said the driver drove on without stopping to help the injured driver .
on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from N@@ ath@@ alia presented himself to the police in Sh@@ ep@@ r@@ on .
he is expected to be indic@@ ted for driver cur@@ ses and lower assistance and for other traffic off@@ ences .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy defe@@ ats ri@@ vals for alleg@@ ations of w@@ rest@@ ling
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised Tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favorites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster &apos;s coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the Storm players &quot; ring struggles &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a barely disgu@@ ised re@@ mark to the Storm team , after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good in w@@ rest@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the t@@ ack of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Tac@@ kl@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers on his team che@@ ered him confi@@ dently , because she was worried that they were worried about being hit by the storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve never heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but over the past six weeks , we have made our contact at Tac@@ kl@@ es a real focus , and this has provided the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent is there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not used to getting used to it , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it &apos;s funny how this time and time again shows up at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and his ment@@ or reminds him that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the premi@@ er league in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne is talking about exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting their game was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm Cup against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the play Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me , it is the game boards .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm team has released this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bians with $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee on Drug Ad@@ dress
a man who could potentially have a life @-@ long punishment because of his attempt to get possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and put in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially lifel@@ ong penalty for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the café could have been a harmless cause .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the risk of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 together in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its statements by the two people , it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Justice Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on deposit , under the conditions that he gives off his austr@@ ali@@ an and his Serbian pass , reports to the police daily and stays at a cur@@ few of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s house breaks apart
in a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site towards Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to escape in the last moment to the left , as the police were ha@@ st@@ ening .
the driver &apos;s cab from the cause of the accident was completely torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely blocked for six hours until 2 am .
the result was a damage of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to enti@@ ce pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg picked up the girl &apos;s phone when she slept , logging into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately alert her mother .
the police looked at the five pictures , then analyzed the computers found under the address and discovered &quot; concerning &quot; web research that used terms for searching for un@@ decent images of children .
Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he had done it , as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the Internet , &quot; and he &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction - that he was addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that searching on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in his head when he was drinking , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and crying .
she also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the def@@ end@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the def@@ end@@ ant used computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to having recorded in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year on the 25th of January of this year and not appearing before court for hearing on March 24 of this year .
defense attorney Greg@@ or S@@ im beg@@ ged that Ho@@ gg would not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the sentence until October to obtain background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted security in this case but was kept in custody because of hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
it was added before the date of judgment into the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
slu@@ dge devi@@ ates to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up off the main control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
for fear of discovery and arrest , many of the lock @-@ houses propag@@ ated people at smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
more than 1000 refugees have been picked up in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday along the river Inn River .
they had reached the German side by foot over bridges and shr@@ u@@ bs .
there they are received by the Federal Police and forwarded to the registration .
the Munich Main Railway station met with significantly more refugees in the wake of the German Federal Police in comparison with the beginning of the week .
around 700 people have arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , a spokes@@ man said in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stuttgart : extension of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tropical storm expected in the southwest &quot; &quot; &quot;
meteor@@ ologists are warning of storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) distributed in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who was dra@@ gged from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic over the past few days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected mainly in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , even up to Thursday early in the Black Forest can be expected on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and at the Lake District with gu@@ sts from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again for a longer time .
the crowd makes it : every two years the car makers at the IAA show their novel@@ ties .
in 2015 , the compact cars are especially well @-@ stock@@ ed , which are currently particularly well @-@ selling .
cars from the compact class are in particular demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) in August alone .
this is reflected also at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 of September ) .
a lot of new compact models will be presented this year between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available to dealers in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive .
Opel presents an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with a 74 kW / 100 hp engine .
in addition , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , including three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which can also be seen at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA in new compact cars ?
Renault Me@@ gan@@ e : Renault returns the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a fifth in a conventional and a super@@ bly sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan designer wants to find his position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti adapts to the brand &apos;s design line with its curved lines .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer also includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications at 170 Nm ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DS 4 : not quite new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n ab@@ duc@@ er put their hands on the front end : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ painted and the modified head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otainment system was modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated into Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time .
at the IAA in the compact class , there were a number of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the new Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court issued a right to an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the judicial exec@@ ution@@ ary , Te@@ gel , who had been housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are fundamentally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in an order published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the parties can even hope for money if they were confined only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel prison facility between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was now on the open foot , had been moved to a larger cell .
his official liability situation for the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the Land of Berlin did not fail .
however , the Constitutional Court raised the verdict of the Court of Appe@@ al in Berlin and rejected the case for re @-@ examination .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hur@@ ting .
chamber Court decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons of the question@@ able period only a few days of detention for compensation were decisive , there was a compensation , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mu@@ til@@ ation of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber Court must now clarify the amount of money compensated .
in the past , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
so they only spoke a det@@ ain@@ ee to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April because he was locked in a cell naked .
according to a 2011 decision , the multiple allocation of a cell without separate toilet is in@@ humane .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe recently confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , a prisoner of decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated daily between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had also hit the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel in recent weeks .
prisoners are therefore always enclosed within 23 hours , aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to m@@ ack@@ ers it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to information from the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ stelle there are 21 points in Te@@ gel not occupied due to young lack , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create that &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what &apos;s going on in Germany ?
according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , about 800@@ ,000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can do that and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) Apartments are used annually - over the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is built up to now ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of housing , however , is dramatic , but above all for affordable housing projects . every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing units from the rental prices drop out , and refugees will also apply for these particularly favorable housing .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is this from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing units would have to be created and therefore the federal government would have to invest a subsi@@ dy of € 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
scientists and Federal Building Minister agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany are not systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial to find a job in Germany .
labour is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich dem@@ and@@ hardt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , according to the Thr@@ u@@ hardt , there has been a political turn@@ around : from the ban on employment for refugees to recognise work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whereas previously there was a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as did the residen@@ cy obligation to restrict asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society , even because of the shortage of skilled labour , there has been a majority in the view that refugees should be allowed to enter the labour market faster .
lack of knowledge of German is a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market .
up to now there is no adequate offer of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that work@@ places are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
according to Thr@@ tas@@ hardt , the construction of networks is the Royal Road to Work Integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 per cent : &quot; for the rooted parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ zel@@ ski , spokesperson for youth and family in the Senate Administration in Berlin .
to convince the family nevertheless of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the demand for educ@@ ators increased greatly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example by allowing more vocational schools .
students are prepared in the countries without any knowledge of German in welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ afford from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no Land of asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception to so far has been Berlin , In@@ ner Sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has quit his position .
students willing to study may be reli@@ eved of access to the university .
because refugees with a residence permit or dung receive no benefits according to the asylum seek@@ er performance law more if they start studying .
princip@@ ally , the latter receive no b@@ af@@ ö@@ g since they do not fall under the circle of the people entitled to bear .
patient refugees have had to live in Germany for four years so far , to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this span is reduced to 15 months .
this financing gap must also be closed , but Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should get af@@ ö@@ g straight away .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually depri@@ ve Islam of the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state churches law will continue to develop into a new state religion relationship .
it is also important to establish an Islamic welfare association who takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
the rights also include duties .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the President of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
those who wanted to prosec@@ ute such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here at times , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
in this way , the majority society will have to change , the elimination of discrimination and rac@@ ism is more pressing .
although Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination centre and a general equality law for a decade .
but it is very slow to learn how the Nazi regime showed that the rac@@ ist motive was systematically ignored by the police and authorities .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans are demanding for a long time and what international tre@@ aties such as anti @-@ rac@@ ism protection Germany commit must become a reality in the next few years if the country is to remain peaceful and to use its new citizens to take advantage of its opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is capable of providing medical care to the refugees previously expected , says President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of man@@ - power and capacity , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must be added to the system for this purpose .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery is asking to issue health cards to all newcom@@ ers right away .
achievements rendered could later be accounted for by the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to leave as many people as possible with the limited service catalog , which the asylum seek@@ er performance law fores@@ ees .
otherwise , the doctors mainly make the language barriers possible .
even so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are less enligh@@ tened about their diseases than other patients .
it is not only in hospitals but also in medical practices that interpre@@ ting costs have to be accepted .
it would have helped many refugees but also with more general medical advice centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
there are clearly more disabled people under refugee camps , and with the young people it is about HIV education .
with the partly different symptoms of disease , German doctors usually come from their training , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis is not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the lack of care , the refugees may even consider relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have a highly developed educational system , many refugees even doctors .
in order to be able to practise , however , they must prove their qualification and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
according to estimates by the German Psycho@@ therapist Association ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study of the TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives in Germany traumati@@ sed .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong dre@@ ad@@ fulness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although mentally ill asylum seek@@ ers in the social offices can make an application for psycho@@ therapy , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the welfare offices , mostly non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for the psychological illness would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts with the new production &quot; Passion . &quot;
the goal is to capture every age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the Man@@ ege on a brick .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ hr@@ erin and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current management stage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
so the family &apos;s gift is in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take the people away from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; welcome cocktail with cos@@ mop@@ olitan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst in his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , it wants to take the Cuban du@@ et easily .
ease and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
besides numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ v@@ ings , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and artic@@ ulation .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yuan .
Ser@@ pent men fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics than little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst looks like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , it doesn &apos;t go well either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aff@@ ection@@ ately &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; will be read from the eyes as far as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the arena .
so the upper@@ most commandment : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra stu@@ d@@ ded , the family Pro@@ bst looks proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in a enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or more 200 spectators , we always do our best and are with all our heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to his performances daily from September 17 @-@ 20 .
on Sunday the program begins at 11 am and 4 pm .
Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe talks about false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , desc@@ ended from a podium in the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the incident spread rapidly across social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by alleg@@ ations of MPs from the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to join Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with calls .
in the past month they had rested and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation - this is the speech which he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones which warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the concerned parliament members that immunity ends in Parliament and as soon as they leave parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard opens up to 30.000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30.000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split up into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service business activities .
the expected job reduction will lead to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , and said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP President and Chief Executive , to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ parall@@ eled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; a statement of the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard to produce electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the place of birth of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring in order to tackle the aband@@ on@@ ment of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area , based on the conviction that closely focused businesses perform better performance .
FC Ar@@ senal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation continues according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario suggests that Wil@@ sh@@ ere certainly won at least the next four games for England and in view of his history his participation in the next summer is surely still uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major matter .
this was only an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister Inj@@ uries is investigating 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 league players in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for ar@@ senal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which have the most vulnerable stage .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a decent time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ ses , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
ar@@ senal begins his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns into a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to take a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Ar@@ senal &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to advance through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , measured at the judge scale of 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Ar@@ senal has drawn up the lesson from the past season with the Champions League surrender to Monaco and remains driven by far @-@ away hope to lead the association to his first prize in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked with ar@@ senal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show giving us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably announced the Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 as the Year of Man with the goal of asking the culture that men hin@@ ders to seek help if they need them .
friendship is at the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends to make a friendship .
in the age of communication led through social media , with its emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which has a much deeper effect on our spiritual health .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the great thing about Friends was that this focus was put on your head .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality shining through the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments in football gu@@ esses in cozy arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they are often reluc@@ tant to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of telephone pastoral care told me , &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; My responsibility for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ murder has really shown me how even the smallest interactions among friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status about the phone may help people in moments of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the completely re@@ designed scenery to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - all 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Mary meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ ging Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria makes his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ ging Cav@@ ani took course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prince &apos;s park@@ stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani got a head ball@@ on in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk , Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they are not only aiming for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no ranking of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to create problems to our opponents and look back relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored one or two more gates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes , which at the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was pi@@ er@@ ced by Di Mary in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month , and he pointed out why when he entered Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he ended up beautifully in the long corner of the grid .
however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , beating Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field lined up a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Cost@@ anza &apos;s posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave herself up , with some mis@@ sp@@ as@@ ons and bad connections , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who scrat@@ ched at no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after launching it after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill if he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a passport of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Mary turned into a shot , which was ste@@ ered by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second door finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus achieved his sixth round of the season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all of the thought that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from a very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the final result low before replacement players E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi completed a gate at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Our last &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Champions League &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then we played only in the Swedish league which did not have the same level .
the qualification matches are not enough . &quot;
take a hat off Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented her switch to FC Bayern 2008
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i plays for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously ahead of the commitment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for the FC Barcelona at that time .
eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times champion league winner , two times club champion , twice world champion , twice world champion , the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar .
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was standing out of Barcelona before the 2008 European Championship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wants to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid has won everything at that time , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and also the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is today working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great European . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he has gotten me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s playing time would have run with X@@ av@@ i in 2008 / 2009 .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the whole distance on the lawn , the reds sprang out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s victory at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in filming
matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion of the variety and said that she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown under@@ lined when this emphasized the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the selected script of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the filling of the film and not in the instrumentation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian bound themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ l brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to encourage people to think about - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of the Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a ne@@ ut@@ te that is beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of Dear White People set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights at the film ; Dam@@ on replied that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded from dis@@ approval via Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni squee@@ zed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WH@@ ITE that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et has earned more than 5,000 rescue @-@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when exact ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter &apos;s movement had a national impact and forced legis@@ lators and authorities to cur@@ b discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured living .
in February , singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter network is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gues who will be invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portra@@ yal of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; crowns first champion
professional sports clim@@ ber and control aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete to win the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which had just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant which could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten managed to finish in the final .
the climbing on a 75 feet long climbing rope was part of the last task in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed the challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! breaking news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never deser@@ ved more than $ 10,000 or had to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he was the first to finish the course , did not receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he receives the great ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll have any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; if I should be struck by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt the same if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand in the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers were reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the Target Field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins used a chance to climb up within a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League of Wild@@ card .
for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all wins are fun no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad P@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three rings .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at bul@@ l@@ bars any game , and therefore I want to go into the game quite concentrated .
the designated tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two rounds , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sw@@ ung the tw@@ ing@@ wood well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ sie . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( kick training ) , looked clearly better from the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back at the end of the seventh Inn@@ ings the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks scored a Bun@@ t , and Simon introduced his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who left the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a Two @-@ Run .
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time this season in the Major League , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe played a double play
after Detroit added a cover @-@ run at the end of the ninth inn@@ ings , wall made a R@@ BI double against the loser of Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed person stab@@ bed S@@ ano in three pitch for his fifth save .
Detroit became the pr@@ el@@ ude to the game of a still un@@ moving Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three rounds in the first two Inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been removed from the injury list before the game after he missed more than a month due to a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ B@@ atter , H@@ ail delivered a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play with a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the runner @-@ up in the scor@@ ing position .
the third winner Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers grew up in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single from Center Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not beat very well , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ess right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ Ei@@ ghter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three hits with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to injury to the lit@@ ters .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated on San@@ che@@ z &apos;s shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , on the jury of injuries since mid @-@ August on the basis of a shoulder dis@@ member@@ ment , should be activated for the launch on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP is stri@@ cken by the list of injuries by L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris in order to compete against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing on the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three matches in Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who arrived in the city will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , like the city Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital had been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily be accommod@@ ated there .
they will then be distributed to other communities .
over the past ten days , according to the government pres@@ idency of Gie@@ ßen , Germany , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse for the first time .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the decisive re@@ thinking about military options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective behaviour &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the cup of military involvement in Germany passed by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends in front of our front door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees .
Austria controlled at the southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister of the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , announced on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany too has not returned refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s been agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could take on a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not give concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their aim is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not so far been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers will take a new approach to the binding distribution of more 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the Federal Government wants to support the countries more strongly in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , and at the end of Tuesday , Merkel announced on Tuesday evening after almost four hours of deliber@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the Chanc@@ ellery of Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people who needed protection would get this too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this opinion had been strongly shared in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enormous effort of power &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest that the border to Romania was sealed with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wanted to prevent tu@@ g@@ boats from going through Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of migrants were on the way to the Greek border .
ambient &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; to be found Ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean sw@@ aps .
this includes researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
as a result , the moon is easily te@@ et@@ tering on its orbit around the ring planet .
although this do@@ cking motion is only small , but still too big for a continuous cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) on Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it has been known for some time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already discovered ice @-@ vul@@ can@@ es at the South Pole of the Saturn &apos;s Moon in 2006 , sp@@ it the water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least on the south pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers then closed .
however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama missing in Munich for several weeks
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1860 München &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has to ren@@ ounce Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month on offensive player Val@@ det R@@ ama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an examination revealed an ab@@ duc@@ tor injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association shared with .
R@@ ama was compl@@ aining about pain at the beginning of the week .
according to Munich &apos;s lions , the diagnosis &quot; is expected to cause four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ on loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports Director Nec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view of the potential obligation of an un@@ compromising pro@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 1960s , however , initially presented a defensive man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last in Belgium and was previously under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the possibility to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

but in spite of the first fears he remained without a severe flo@@ wering .
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to his slim line are often dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : there are B vitamins in them as well as the vitamins E and C. Most of all , however , man@@ goes contain plenty of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor of beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support ey@@ esi@@ ght , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying man@@ gos , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasantly .
the color of the peel alone does not tell how ripe the fruit is - so green man@@ goes can also taste delicious .
they should store at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
they then taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives hear@@ ty dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .

on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday the F@@ öhn blows partly with storm strength through the fo@@ al valleys .
after fo@@ eh@@ ling on Thursday morning we cross a prominent cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature drop .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the forefront of an extensive low @-@ pressure region over the British Is@@ les in a strong south west current .
on the side of the Alps on Wednesday the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys .
subsequently , the F@@ öhn blows up to Thursday morning in the fo@@ eh@@ valleys with gu@@ sts from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land also with more than 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn is able to advance in some places up to the adjacent centre and even Or@@ can arches of over 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday winds blow in for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the alpine slope .
rain starts here , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in sum , in the south of the Alps in the next 48 hours , with partial over 100 liters of rain per square meter , this has to be expected , after already large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last days .
on Thursday morning the F@@ öhn blows out , as a result a cold front rolls with strong , partly thunder@@ ed rain from west to east over Switzerland .
together with the cold front , the wind dev@@ ours strongly to stor@@ my temperatures , and temperatures are rising significantly .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it becomes sunny and warmer at weekends with up to 25 degrees .
Rome has now a Martin Luther Place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther &apos;s place in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , on Wednesday a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Association of Protestant Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could live often only in secret places for centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , the square becomes visible that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a rotten egg @-@ be@@ ak .
his negative impressions are likely to have encouraged him in his later battle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against the ab@@ duction trading .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus wearing the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt drew for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated biblical texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which is now published with gorgeous pictures .
in the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 motifs has formulated his personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 year old - but which is by no means equivalent with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective subjects , this can be quite glo@@ omy .
Ot@@ mar Alt worked for around three years on his bi@@ ble project for which he made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; Book of All Books . &quot;
these are cycles that dev@@ ote themes such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments or fa@@ ther@@ land .
he has fascinated several partners at the moment : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological focus as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost who has dealt with the Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible passages from Ot@@ mar Alt and so into today , translated into current contexts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of old painting .
they are embedded between the original quote of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry clasp has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ members Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to re@@ work it , perhaps to bring myself back to my father &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to make the art more valuable in the shortest possible time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is today marked by advertisement , and that is loud .
symboli@@ sm is disp@@ elled .
artists have a different lust and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in that respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ ade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the images , let them work , discover and sense what force they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost visited Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art &apos;s Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on Tuesday : &quot; I like to be a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; I like living with his pictures . &quot;
I have not taken care to fully grasp the Bible , but chose the themes that are important to him , including mysterious themes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
part of the original - paper and screen images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
start of construction for the BM@@ X railway is near
plans made , place found , company charged , earth hills model@@ ed for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was already finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; failures in politics and administration ensured dr@@ y@@ ness , especially among the residents who didn &apos;t want to tolerate the railway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so hill shot down , looking for new place - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the permission will be received in October , the First Community Secretary Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the Child and Youth Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should then be started without a &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga cat@@ ers for a clear signal on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football respon@@ ds to the p@@ itting situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in dealing with the problems that arise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t concern me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or next Wednesday and meet the minister of State Mrs. O@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly play a central role here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and may help .
but the crucial points must put politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association therefore expanded its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiative for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation ensures that this programme will continue until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the outskirts of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Bundes@@ li@@ gi@@ sts also support this programme .
already this weekend , the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign when they will carry the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s Sports Director , Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , no one is allowed to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can play football teams , no , we have to use our jet force , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees that have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Quali@@ fication Game against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license clubs started their own projects in their places was great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this year and next year , the association will jointly provide 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the associations have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : CEO of SAP lo@@ oses an eye in the accident
according to several reports , the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the accident on the stair@@ way in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he had fallen into a glass of water , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ woche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bleeding , he was power@@ less , then dra@@ gged out to the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go after his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; Platt@@ ner said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully work@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full of SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually sw@@ ings between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important for him to come to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s important to get up again when you &apos;re fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen apart from fighting ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a photograph and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he therefore came up with little as a spare @-@ driver for Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button during night races in Singapore , just like one week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
soccer : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ lows in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot resort to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel for Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach left open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its pro@@ positions on the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the door@@ keeper &apos;s position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of master keeper Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Champion praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be used in all European League matches in the future , however , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open .
with a high lik@@ el@@ ihood , he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ ceful statement by fellow player Re@@ us , that the final draw for the BV@@ B in the Europa League needs to be the goal , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l holds for re@@ trac@@ table : &quot; thus Marco is not that wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to lead the way for Germany
according to the government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the automobile .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the outskirts of the Autom@@ ne IAA from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries who also come together with industry representatives at the IAA .
among other things , the transport ministry &apos;s strategy paper stresses the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid growth on digital radio communications .
to test new technology , there is currently a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks be imposed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally to ensure that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only pre@@ views humans as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more passengers .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are to be expected until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value creation in the area of driver assistance systems and highly @-@ automated driving functions at the Germany site appreci@@ ates the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of passenger cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the Germans are still scep@@ tical - much more than Fren@@ ch@@ men or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday ( AA ) on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the In@@ quiry De@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 per cent do not believe it at all in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe it at all .
France accounts for 21 percent of respon@@ dents up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent .
drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after an elevation of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , this could at least be 15 percent in flowing traffic , 45 percent in traffic jams .
well , each fourth would leave the car under no circumstances control .

according to the current status , the Düsseldorf @-@ based Düsseldorf will only want to hit the single for the title fight from September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision will be made latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European training course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time , B@@ oll was on the flight for a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 year old German master is expected back on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who launches the Qu@@ etz@@ als in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the 2013 European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo was also missing , and we became Europe &apos;s masters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should focus on this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the fifth fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English soccer player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has drawn a serious injury on the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an enf@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figur@@ ine greeting card : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the enf@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it used to be ble@@ ached earlier , but now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer changed his attitude towards a show of his person at the beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who has written fashion history without ever completing a training .
chron@@ ologically the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed total art work for which much effort has been carried out : to freeze the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list has been hired for example .
according to the dict@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers made 14 tons of material to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest , a special delic@@ acy was still present : a leather h@@ osen outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
it stands for the designer &apos;s first tent@@ ative mathematical attempts .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents couldn &apos;t have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the design of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , including Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first own fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes .
Je@@ wel@@ ry instead of sheer curtain - P@@ lau@@ dry lace as fashion niche
earlier it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about making meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were created in large quantities for customers , who , for example , processed them for blankets and she@@ ers .
this is no longer working on its own , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en company .
instead fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en tip , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects to past bul@@ l@@ do@@ ves , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use niche in the textile industry in Germany are no longer available on the market .
with us , they make up half of all orders .
together with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery .
only they must wear the protected label .
over the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken off .
there is almost no shortage of private specialized shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
today , mass goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively via chains .
exports , to Russia and the United States , are also weak@@ ening .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association also tries to score points by environmental awareness as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains about the stick in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we have a quality seal showing that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduated designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch of the West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to keep a customer base .
some years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ vit@@ alized the historical snow ball .
the machine is sti@@ cking small spheres at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing master Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took his inspiration : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I could not start anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ dry lace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic P@@ lau@@ en tip - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings and who would like to have a souvenir .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en tip .

according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it &apos;s not about a re @-@ film , but a kind of continuation that takes place twenty years after the first movie with the magical child girl .
it &apos;s about the experiences of the n@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
those who play P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .

XI pus@@ hes to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to open wide towards the outside to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was tas@@ ked with steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Board for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
promoting new businesses and promoting reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , said X@@ i .
the management group has adopted a number of policies , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
after the statement , a list of neg@@ atives is created that identifies sectors and companies that do not come into question for investments .
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is important as it as@@ signs a greater role to the market in the allocation of resources , guaranteeing a legal business environment and making the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the company and ensure companies decide how to manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border business cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
in the context of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas will be opened for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting also Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double limit the levels of mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and thus to the consumer a significantly higher dose of the tox@@ in .
the Consumer Organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who is present in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side @-@ effects of failed industrial and environmental policy will be handed down with full force to pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; said F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , are to be lifted from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish at the end of the food chain .
even today large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury , that around 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed to be sold on the basis of the currently valid limit values .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ sal@@ able .
in return for this e@@ asing , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller do@@ ily fish , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they comply with the planned maximum values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ di@@ ous distra@@ ction &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which is highly concentrated across the food chain , especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts of particularly un@@ born damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cause &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry says on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health risk of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cannot be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury mainly enters the environment by burning coal .
according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of the Environment Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock occupied more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and surface @-@ covering &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish already accounted for the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
