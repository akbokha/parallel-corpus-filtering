the organisation will be held out on the ongoing basis of the total amount and the composition of this material in the state concerned or in the states concerned and on any passing on such material from this state or states .
this explains their agreement as quickly as possible ; it extends solely on matters such as temporary and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not include an endor@@ sement or a knowledge of military activity , and does not refer to the use of the core material .
the organization , the community and the states bear the costs incurred by each of them in carrying out their respective obligations arising from this Convention .
if the Community , the states or persons who are subject to their sovereign power , but extraordinary costs as a result of a special request of the organization , the organization will reimbur@@ se these costs , provided that it has been informed beforehand .
in any case , the organization carries the costs of all additional measurements and sampling demanded by the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
the Community and States ensure that liability insurance for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with its laws and other regulations , to the organization and its officials for the purpose of carrying out this Convention in the same way as to the nationals of the states .
any claim granted to the Community or the State against the Organization or the Organization for Dam@@ age to the Community or to a State for Dam@@ age , except for Dam@@ age from a Nu@@ clear Inter@@ action , which arose from the implementation of the security measures under this Convention , is governed in accordance with international law .
in accordance with the fac@@ tual information submitted by the Director General , the Council as@@ signs that the organization is not able to verify that no nuclear material , which must be subject to securing measures under this Convention , shall be reimbur@@ sed for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explo@@ sives , and may also take the other measures envis@@ aged in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Articles of Association .
in such steps , the Council , in which measure has been acquired by the applied security measures , takes into account , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contracting parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security .
on request of the Organization , Community or State , consultations on questions arise arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention .
the Community and the States are entitled to ask that questions arising from the interpretation or application of the Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in discussing such questions by the Council .
with the exception of any dispute , pursuant to article 19 or any of the measures adopted by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be settled upon request of a party to an arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal consisting of five arbit@@ rators .
the community and the states ren@@ ounce two refer@@ ees , the organization also ap@@ points two refer@@ ees , and the four appointed refer@@ ees select a fifth , which leads the chair@@ manship .
if the Community and the States or the Organization shall not appoint two refer@@ ees within thirty days of the motion to arbit@@ ration , the Community or the Organisation may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these refer@@ ees .
the same procedure shall apply if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected within thirty days of the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbit@@ rators .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the agreement is to determine the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of Part I on securing measures as required .
the objective of the safety measures set out in this Convention is timely detection of the junc@@ ture of significant quantities of nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ r@@ ence from such a branch due to the risk of early detection .
in order to obtain the target set out in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a preventive measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial confin@@ ement and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical completion of the inspections by the organisation is carried out by an explanation in which the amount of material specified for each material balance zone is specified for a specified period of time , indicating the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen .
in carrying out their investigations , the organization makes full use of the security system of the Community in accordance with Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the core material of the Community in accordance with this Convention is based on an outline in material balance zones .
in the application of their safegu@@ ards , the Community will make use of de procedures and actions of the following kind and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are near@@ er defined and appropriate in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of obtained , produced , lost , lost or otherwise removed nuclear material and stock quantities ;
B ) the evaluation of the reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for the determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and receiver ;
e ) method for ass@@ essing the accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and report system , which points out the core material inventory and the changes in this stock for each material balance zone , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Method to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the security measures under this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c ) , is introduced into the states , so the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it is not implemented for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ op@@ ia enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced , or is this core material or other core material produced in the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other preventive measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The safegu@@ ards envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for nuclear material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the conditions specified in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the Community is in view that the recovery of nuclear material , which is subject to hed@@ ging after this Convention , is temporarily not possible or desired , consult the Organization and the Community about the use of suitable securing measures .
B ) The safegu@@ ards envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for nuclear material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community find that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
upon request of the Community , the organisation liber@@ ates the following core material from the security measures following this Convention :
a ) Partic@@ ular fis@@ sile material , when used in gram or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) core material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
upon request of the Community , the organisation liber@@ ates the core material , which would otherwise be subject to security measures under the agreement , from these safegu@@ ards , unless the total amount of the core material released in the States is at no time any more than
a ) a total of one kilogram of special p@@ liable material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment that lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ an@@ ium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.0@@ 05 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) 20 metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.0@@ 05 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if the delivered core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the safegu@@ arding measures under this Convention , precau@@ tions are made for the re@@ use of the securing measures on that material .
the Community meets the organization of supplementary agreements , which are necessary in the scope that is necessary for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the Organization under this Convention , in detail as to how the procedures laid down in the Convention are to be applied .
the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without any changes to the agreement in the agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within nin@@ ety days of the entry into force of the Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
based on the initial report outlined in Article 62 , the organization maintains a summari@@ zed inventory of the entire core material underlying the security measures of this Convention , regardless of its origin , and carries on this inventory diagram due to the subsequent reports and the results of its investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other
in ER@@ WA@@ GN@@ UNG O@@ GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EW@@ G has decided to contribute to the Special Action Programme set out at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by common res@@ sour@@ ced transport problems .
C ) The aim of the EEC and the Member States is that the contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months after the entry into force of the agreement and , as far as possible , is issued within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organisation will do its utmost to achieve this objective .
D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organisation of the EEC has tab@@ led a table from which it is clear in which way it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement .
the organisation establishes a special account under the name &quot; Special Trade Account &quot; which consists of the funds managed by the Member States in accordance with this Agreement and is used ( in this capacity the organization is referred to as &quot; Man@@ age &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account will be separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able notes of the member state , which are payable upon request in the currency of the respective state at Order of the Organization as administrator of the special transaction and to be deposited in the deposit of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker at the appointed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time agreed between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker considering the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Each Member State may wish to make payments to the above @-@ mentioned dates upon request .
the car@@ et@@ aker takes about proportion@@ ate pulling on the cash or the school j@@ ars according to the usual procedures of the organization in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction and to balance the special transaction account appropriately .
when granting these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the EEC :
III ) to the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its additional lending capacity to loan terms without dis@@ agreement ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the affected countries settle by contributions from other sources .
each special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly expanding development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral proposal ) , regardless of whether it is a loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices that are considered , approved and administered for the development credits financed from the regular resources of the organization , with the aim of this agreement to be taken into account in the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble .
the funds of the special transaction account must not be used instead of the ord@@ inal means of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which are bound in the framework of a loan or credit for a program or project which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same payment conditions which are generally valid for the development loan granted by the Organization ; thus , they are re@@ payable in 50 years in ten years .
special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are re@@ payable in these currencies .
amounts for payment of this fee are to be paid directly to the organisation which it retains .
each special transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker , in particular the origin of the means is indicated .
the income from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or issued in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization , and which , in accordance with what the car@@ et@@ aker set at the time of granting loans , may be recipients of a special transaction .
the capital re@@ payments of special transactions are transferred to the special transaction account , and the amount ref@@ unded in that way in the currency of a member state is to be returned as soon as possible from the administrator to the member state concerned .
until full disclosure of all special transactions , the Executive Board informs the EEC about the plans and programmes approved by the directors in preparation for the review by the directors .
during the time of withdrawal of the special transaction , the administrator gives the EW@@ G quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expenses made for this .
the administrator transm@@ its the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the business year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with an opinion from the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this statement .
after full payment of the special transaction , the administrator of the EW@@ G transfers as soon as possible a detailed report about the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account .
the administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are evident from the accounts payable to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States .
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
for this purpose , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator to the full edition of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time conduct an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions and all other questions concerning the provisions of this Agreement .
if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date on which the EEC and the Organisation may agree , the agreement and all obligations arising there@@ from shall become invalid with immediate effect .
if the total amount of the total amount of the special transaction loans received by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement is rep@@ aid and transferred to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations arising there@@ from shall be termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval from the Member States and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States are noti@@ fying the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings in question .
the Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards this notification together with a notification of the regular approval of this Agreement by the EEC to the Organisation .
this agreement will be effective and will enter into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned notification in the organization .
this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with any wording being equally author@@ itative .

the agreements may be made up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor &apos;s country to the mechanism , namely within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invoice units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future deployment opportunities of the member countries .
however , some conditions have already been mentioned below , for which the BI@@ S would be ready .
with every stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als , without exceeding five years altogether .
in the event of opening credits as well as for any extension the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first dra@@ fts will not be made before the end of one month after the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the Stand@@ by Agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the accor@@ ds would take place in the currencies available at the BI@@ S at the conclusion of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods of time taking into account the funds of the bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those used by the BI@@ S at the time under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to market value .
however , if the BI@@ S has to obtain the necessary funds on the market itself , the interest rate applied to the application could reach a maximum that corresponds to a corresponding margin increased Li@@ bor .
I would be grateful if you would like to inform me of the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could include stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks issue a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would like to share with me the consent of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic on Trade with H@@ amm@@ el and Lamb
I would like to address the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations for the establishment of provisions on the import of amm@@ uni@@ tion , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat . during these negotiations , the two parties are as follows :

the community under@@ takes all to avoid a market development that could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the joint market within the agreed volumes .
in particular , the Community is taking precau@@ tions so that the sale of inter@@ vention@@ marks on frozen meats is not under@@ mining the sales of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat .
taking into account the aims and provisions of this agreement , the Community agreed that any actual application of reimbur@@ sement or other promotion measures for the export of lambs and lamb and slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lambs are only given at prices and conditions which comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade with these products .

a re@@ agent for blood group identification must react with all tested blood samples which contain the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or any other substance given on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a )
the ti@@ ter is measured twice in a suitable medium through repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be investigated .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of strongest ser@@ um di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively for the volume of the blood cells in@@ undation in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on slides , activity is expressed through time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has set up international standards for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ completely Anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are currently being elabor@@ ated .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of the re@@ agents for the determination of the blood group of most species is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ary , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series in which a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood group determination , present for the International standard preparations ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as incomplete anti @-@ D ) can be expressed on the basis of the title of the unknown agent in comparison to the International standard preparation or a state standard preparation in international units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring it again to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ ears contain 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .

if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall remain for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to label lies at most a year after the last satisfactory effectiveness test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents on the label is based on the results of the feasibility studies ; it is to be approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed in such a way that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ ous oxide at a pressure of no more than 0.0@@ 2 mm Hg in 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may design@@ ate that an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic is added to the re@@ agent ( or solvents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) , provided that the re@@ agent maintains the conditions of specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera of human origin for blood group identification must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml of liquid or re@@ active ser@@ um .
the re@@ agents , regardless of whether in liquid form or after re @-@ dissolution , must be transparent and must not contain sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents destined for the international exchange for blood group determination should not be colored arti@@ fici@@ ally as long as possible , at least until an international agreement has come about through a unified system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent located in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and checks of re@@ agents for blood group identification .
adequate samples of all re@@ agents are to be stored for so long by the laboratory until it is likely to be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids for strengthening the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective component .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents can contain no substances of human origin .
each container has a black on white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or , with dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for the recovery process ,
in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located or the instructions attached to the containers contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3. the quantity or , with dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for the recovery process ,
