this document is a summary of the European Public Employment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has judged the trials carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
if you require further information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. C@@ ast thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , suspi@@ ci@@ ons and del@@ u@@ sions ; • bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psych@@ ic disorder , in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of anor@@ ex@@ ic high spirits ) alternating with periods of normal spirits .
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used to insert or melt tablets in patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
for patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose should be adjusted by A@@ bili@@ fy .
this interfer@@ es with the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to one another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is probably mainly known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is like 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters to activate recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ zophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ r@@ ence .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ zophren@@ ia or similar disease suffering from increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study A@@ bili@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence , in 160 patients with whom the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients suffering from bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased un@@ rest with that of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psycho@@ tic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
all studies examined the change in the symptoms of patients based on a standard sc@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment .
the company also carried out studies in order to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and absor@@ bs the solution .
in the two studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased un@@ rest than the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo .
in the application to treat bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced in four of the five short @-@ term studies man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than plac@@ ebo .
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented for up to 74 weeks more effectively than plac@@ ebo the recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if administered in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy injection in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy for inhal@@ ation ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled bite ) , tre@@ mor , nausea , vom@@ iting , nausea , vom@@ iting ( increased s@@ ali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep distur@@ b@@ ance ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ zophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients with predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were referring to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of injection solution were out@@ weigh@@ ed in patients with schi@@ zophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not appropriate to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for the placing of A@@ bili@@ fy in the European Union .
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily , regardless of meals .
an increased efficacy in dos@@ ages above a daily dose of 15 mg was not demonstrated although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ zophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
considering the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l dosage should be reduced to the recommended dosage ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no high suicide risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ ge@@ mia , treatment with hem@@ ost@@ atic medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ esia .
if patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy are signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of a M@@ NS or has unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo .
however , there was one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response for un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic active substances , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no exact risk estimates for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events involving A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic active agents to allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ mers , poly@@ morph@@ ism , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ y and weakness should be observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ zophren@@ ia patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti @-@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is required when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally active pharmaceuticals with over@@ lying side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid block@@ ers , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ers , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensions .
if one considers the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after sett@@ ling the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 in@@ hibition the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose level before the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ racy concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 m@@ g. of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ phy / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ cycl@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ phy ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used during pregnancy because of the insufficient data state for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in the reproduction studies at the animal , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machinery , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole did not have any negative impact on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ zophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , overall lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ouse , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under sc@@ alp@@ ap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance - In a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under semi @-@ oper@@ i@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
during the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters emerged , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
adverse events related to anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , and their occurrence in the treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without cause of death .
there is no information about the efficacy of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in in the treatment of over@@ dosing with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosage as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ zophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partially antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors .
in vitro Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 1- and D3 @-@ receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was administered in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks in healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 @-@ receptor lig@@ ands , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ test .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term trials ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ zophren@@ ia patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ dents reported a response to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ zophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % lower than plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ sc@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study involving schi@@ zophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients experienced weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a plac@@ ebo superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a efficacy comparable to plac@@ ebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also demonstrated in week 12 a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia like lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirr@@ oring , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a superior response to the prevention of a bi@@ polar back@@ fall , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ meth@@ yl@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ lam@@ ation is cataly@@ sed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean eli@@ oration time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive metabolism through C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at nearly 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ei@@ ers via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ zophren@@ ia patients no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a simulation @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any clin@@ ically significant differences regarding ethnic origin or impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not identify any particular dangers for humans based on the conventional studies of safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no significance for clinical application .
the effects included dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al @-@ toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ mentation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase in adren@@ al @-@ kidney cancer and combined anc@@ illary rin@@ ds ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum allow@@ ance in humans ) .
moreover , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral doses of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold .
however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of monkeys and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro solu@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the average steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dosage .

man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disturbances - In a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 2@@ 6.5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ zophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partially antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ sc@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study involving schi@@ zophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients experienced weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a relative bio @-@ availability study in which pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were compared with 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral doses of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the average steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dosage .
A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control ag@@ gi@@ ti@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ zophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically attached , the treatment should be completed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase res@@ or@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under removal of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or ac@@ utely therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy melting tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution to take .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection in patients with as@@ tig@@ m@@ acy and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were different from schi@@ zophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure loss ( see Section 4.5 ) .
tests on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ ge@@ mia , treatment with hem@@ ost@@ atic medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ esia .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ mers , poly@@ morph@@ ism , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ y and weakness should be observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ zophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti @-@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was larger compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole &apos;s sole application , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) was used as a single @-@ mal@@ function intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and that obtained at the same time Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) intra@@ muscular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid block@@ ers , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ers , compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive Met@@ aboli@@ zing , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after sett@@ ling the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 in@@ hibition the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose level before the start of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) were obtained intra@@ muscular , the intensity of the se@@ dation was larger compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole &apos;s sole gift .

the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
during the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters emerged , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
adverse events related to anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , and their occurrence in the treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of ag@@ gi@@ tization / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ it@@ ating and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms in relation to plac@@ ebo and similar to the lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed mean improvement from bas@@ eline on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score for the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe dis@@ infection , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the population population , but a statistical significance could be determined on account of a reduced number of patients .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term trials ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ zophren@@ ia patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( or@@ ally ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ dents reported a response to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ zophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( or@@ ally ) showed a significantly greater reduction in the rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ sc@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study involving schi@@ zophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase in weight of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirr@@ oring , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a superior response to the prevention of a bi@@ polar back@@ fall , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % larger in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as a tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was 15@@ - and 5 times higher than the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity following intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns emerged after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum of 30 mg of human therapeutic exposure .
based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( or@@ ally ) for safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not identify any particular dangers for the human being .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no significance for clinical application .
the effects included dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al @-@ toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ mentation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase in adren@@ al @-@ state @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) in females at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the middle level of steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dosage in humans ) .
moreover , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dosage , which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the middle @-@ steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dosage .

the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of whom about three quarters earlier had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in the sole application or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to a drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other drugs to reduce side effects ) .
overall , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
if only the patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs in relation to the efficacy indicators such as time to wor@@ sen@@ ing of the disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer were compared to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in their blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients with the first treatment to be more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , and that in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , it must not be given with other medicines to reduce side @-@ effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the marketing of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients receiving first line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not indicated ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in sensory Neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ie degrees 3 treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached at degree 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there have been no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological features than other wor@@ dings of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again .
in the case of patients no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils number has increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
whereas abnormal cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was clearly not proven with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying cardiac or lung disease .
if nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea occur in the patients after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ atics and contrac@@ ep@@ tive methods .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or in child@@ bearing age who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
women of child@@ bearing age should undergo a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to one month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after the treatment .
before treatment , male patients should be advised of a sperm con@@ served , since the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very often ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) which can affect transport efficiency and the ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important events of adverse events reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III trial .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most con@@ spic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
occasional : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tic hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :

rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , there are no estimates of the actual incidence and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ tim@@ ub@@ ules ingredient that promotes the con@@ formation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bul@@ a and stabili@@ ses the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing its dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation results in an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital interactions and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in im@@ parts the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ receptor and due to the alb@@ um@@ in protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation occurs in the area of the tumor .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two mon@@ oton@@ ously un@@ f@@ aded studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study .
in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer in 30 minutes .
this multic@@ entre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only due to metastatic disease and 19 % due to metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for overall response rates and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving a grade for patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for dec@@ aying bas@@ eline based on the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions by Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies .
the active substance exposition ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi @-@ phase manner .
the mean distribution volume amounted to 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or tissue binding of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to an intraven@@ ous 30 minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values following a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the settlement of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) following the Abra@@ x@@ ane application ( 43 % ) than after a solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative discharge of the unchanged active substance was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
however , only a few data are available for patients over 75 years of age , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light light protected over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ar@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be treated with caution when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0,@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into a Abra@@ x@@ ane breakthrough bottle .
after complete en@@ core of the solution , the bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid .

• Training leaf@@ let • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging examples . • With unique pic@@ torial presentation of the correct use of the product , cooling boxes for transport through the patients .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ uses in which there may be complications in connection with blood trans@@ fusion , if an endo@@ genous blood donation is not possible before the intervention , and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is to be expected .
the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be made by the patient or his supervis@@ or , provided that they have received appropriate instructions .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values should always lie in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ inal deficiency , or that the body does not respond adequately to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it em@@ powers to the formation of epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa .
when administered as an injection into a v@@ ein , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to a primary study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , compared to the reference drug .
all participating patients had been inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o into a v@@ ein before they were either converted to ab@@ y@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of ab@@ y@@ amed under the skin were investigated with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were killed on ab@@ y@@ amed were maintained in the same measure as those who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , p@@ ung@@ ing mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not cause allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the European Union regulations , evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that manufactures Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for healthcare professionals across all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a approval for the placing of ab@@ y@@ amed in the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tum@@ ours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multiple my@@ el@@ oma that receive chemotherapy , and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the on@@ set of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , for planned larger surgical procedures that require a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
for the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected loss of blood from 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients where the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; it is therefore necessary to assess the individual clinical course and condition of disease by the doctor .
a rise in ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values can be observed on or below the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration in one patient .
given this ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be used to achieve the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa dosage must be reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permitted dose required to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week via intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; it is therefore necessary to assess the individual clinical course and condition of disease by the doctor .
given this ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be used to achieve the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permitted dose required to control an@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of treatment the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the response rate number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l over the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l have increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value is ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
if the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the response rate number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be stopped .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood vessels is required , should be obtained twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure at a dose of 600 I.@@ E. / kg body weight .
iron sub@@ stitution should begin as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program began , so that large iron reserves are available before the beginning of the ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ E. / kg each on 10 consecutive days , on the day of the intervention and 4 days immediately thereafter .
alternatively , the injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given over the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure adequate injection of the drug in the circulation .
patients undergoing treatment with some er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n in er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive an Ab@@ se@@ amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n ( see Section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ op@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ lies ) .
the application of epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients with a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery : severe cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ d or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with a recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ op@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n .
in patients with sudden loss of action , defined as reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the eti@@ qu@@ ette value should be determined and the usual causes of non @-@ response ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium oxide , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the hypo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the cat@@ u@@ loc@@ yte &quot; index &quot; ) , is reduced ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes and leu@@ k@@ oc@@ yte numbers are normal , and if no other cause of an active loss is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n antibodies should be determined and a study of the bone mar@@ row to diagnose a PR@@ CA .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in maintenance therapy , the upper limit of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in section 4.2 .
in clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ic @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit attributed to the administration of epo@@ eti@@ dine if the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for controlling the symptoms and preventing blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive failure , the upper limit of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
according to these findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ tic , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in tumour patients receiving chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin response should be taken into account for the evaluation of epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa therapy efficiency ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 , in order to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ mbo@@ tic events ( see section 4.2 ) treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk weighing while taking part in the patient , which should also consider the specific clinical context .
if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated appropriately if possible before the beginning of the epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa therapy .
patients undergoing large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ mbo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ tic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa for patients with an output h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of post @-@ operative thro@@ mbo@@ tic / vascular events may exist .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ eti@@ n was not shown to improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy , a ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 @-@ 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine dose should be adapted to the rising ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ rit .
in vitro examinations on tumor tissues there is no indication of an interaction between epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in relation to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
thro@@ mbo@@ tic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , re@@ in@@ al@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa .
the most frequent side effect during treatment with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or wor@@ sen@@ ing an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vas@@ cul@@ tic events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n treatment , it is possible to treat patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ mbo@@ tic and vascular complications .
the genetic al@@ fa @-@ based epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and is identical with the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n , which was isolated from the urine of local patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa specifically stimulates er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ ost@@ asis ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ H@@ od@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ ost@@ asis ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 172 breast cancer tum@@ ors , 23 cancer carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 more ) .
in 1895 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 6@@ 83 breast carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 174 gy@@ nec@@ ological tum@@ ours , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ ost@@ asis .
survival and tumour progression were studied in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n showed a consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality rate than in the controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n and controls .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these findings are transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as few patients with these characteristics were included in the reviewed data .
epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa @-@ determin@@ ations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy subjects and a slightly longer half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um levels of epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa are much lower than ser@@ um levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the ser@@ um mirrors remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first administration or 24 hours after the last administration .
bone mar@@ in@@ opathy is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were treated three years with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ in@@ opathy was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa .
14 In animal experiments with approximately 20 times the recommended weekly dosage , epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa led to decreased federal body weight , del@@ aying the Os@@ si@@ fication and a rise in red@@ dish mortality .

prior to the market launch and in accordance with agreement with the competent authorities of the member states , the owner of the marketing authorization must provide medical specialists in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials : • Training leaf@@ let • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging inserts . • With unique pic@@ torial presentation of the correct use of the product provided refriger@@ ants for transport through the patients .
the owner of the marketing authorization has to ensure that the pharmaceutical @-@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application is established and functional before the drug is brought into circulation and as long as the medicine applied in the traffic is applied .
the owner of the licence for placing on the market is obliged to carry out the studies and additional measures of the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance listed in the Pharma@@ ko@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the authorisation application , as well as to carry out the risk management plan adopted by the CH@@ MP .
according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal use , &quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • on receipt of new information , which may affect the current safety specifications ( safety Speci@@ fication ) , the Pharma@@ ko@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance Plan , or the risk reduction measures within 60 days after reaching an important ( the Pharma@@ ko@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or Risk Re@@ duction ) mil@@ estones • by the E@@ MEA
• Have a heart attack or stroke within one month before your treatment • if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time arising or increased chest pain ) - the risk of a drop in blood in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) - if you have used such a blood graf@@ ting in the past , for example
you suffer from severe isch@@ emia of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion ) , the cervi@@ cal vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) you recently suffered from a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed , a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of plat@@ el@@ ets can occur within the normal range , which is re@@ trac@@ ted again during further treatment .
your doctor will need regular blood tests to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets regularly during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
lack of iron , dis@@ solving of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 , or lack of foli@@ c acid , should be considered and treated before the beginning of the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n was reported very rarely on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ der@@ ia after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n .
if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ op@@ ia , it will ab@@ ort your treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best handled .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value can pose the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and that the risk of death could be increased .
if you have increased or increasing cali@@ per your doctor may consider an interruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium values are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or st@@ ow@@ age sign caused by insufficient heart performance , your doctor will make sure that your ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to these findings , the treatment of an@@ ab@@ y@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ tic , is not accelerated by the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week lag between epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa @-@ administration and the desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of ab@@ y@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your sever@@ ity dose accordingly to keep the risk of a thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( thro@@ mbo@@ tic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be carefully weigh@@ ed against the benefits derived from treatment with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( e.g. a deep v@@ ein thro@@ mbo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
if you are cancer patient , bear in mind that Ab@@ se@@ amed can act as a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances affect the tumor neg@@ atively .
if you have an orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated appropriately before the start of the treatment .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed , as there is an increased risk of post @-@ graf@@ ting after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other drugs / applying / applying them recently , even if they are not prescription drugs .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may need to arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means of building up the immune system , for example with cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your blood pressure ( an@@ emia ) appeals to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will need regular blood tests to check the success of your treatment and ensure that the medicine acts properly and your ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well set , you receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread over two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor will need regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure that the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the treating doctor will carry out regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before the surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg may be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of operation and another 4 days after the surgery .
however , if your doctor considers this to be appropriate , you can also learn how to squ@@ ir@@ t yourself under the skin .

ac@@ last@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a minor trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
additionally , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; before the first in@@ fusion , patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ up@@ a must be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ up@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate ac@@ last@@ a .
the first study included almost 8 000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently had a hip frac@@ ture ; it was examined the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get ac@@ last@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the ser@@ um ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) in the blood back norm@@ alized or decreased at least 75 % compared with the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under ac@@ last@@ a ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients under the plac@@ ebo .
compared to all patients under ac@@ last@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) with those under plac@@ ebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under ac@@ last@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ up@@ a occur within the first three days after the in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
ac@@ last@@ a must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with ac@@ last@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis ( dying of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of ac@@ last@@ a provides information for physicians who prescri@@ be ac@@ last@@ a to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains information on how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the placing of ac@@ last@@ a in the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package should be provided and include the following core messages : • The package insert • Con@@ trast @-@ indication in pregnancy and in nursing women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Major signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When taking care of medical or nursing assistance
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous 5 mg ac@@ last@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the dosage of ac@@ last@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ up@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the disease Pa@@ get .
after the treatment of the disease Pa@@ get with Ac@@ up@@ a , a long re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly recommended that in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get adequate intake of calcium , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of el@@ em@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first ac@@ last@@ a fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol can be reduced shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance ( &lt; 35 ml / min ) , ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger ones .
children and adolescents of Ac@@ up@@ a are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , as data is lacking for safety and efficacy .
ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experiences exist for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia should be treated with ac@@ last@@ a prior to therapy with sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid insertion of the effect of cit@@ ric acid to bone reconstruction , temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , the maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly recommended that in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient supply of calcium , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of el@@ em@@ ental calcium , to ensure at least 10 days after the application of ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered before using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental examination with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who require dental intervention , no data is available whether the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol can be reduced shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol ( see section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of suspected cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased in patients receiving ac@@ last@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between ac@@ last@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
kidney function disorder was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions associated with kidney function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the alteration of the cre@@ atine @-@ clearing ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as impaired ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable to the acet@@ ate and plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um cre@@ atine within 10 days of application was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with acet@@ one compared to 0.8 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were observed in 2.3 % of patients treated with ac@@ last@@ a in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with ac@@ last@@ a in the disease Pa@@ get study .
all patients received suppl@@ em@@ ental sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently received hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ up@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the in@@ fusion center , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area was reported , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primary in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention .
7 Inves@@ tig@@ ations with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area for one with acet@@ one and in a patient treated with plac@@ ebo .
in case of an over@@ dose which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by adding oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous calcium glu@@ con@@ ate intraven@@ ously .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of ac@@ last@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been demonstrated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) T score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal frac@@ ture .
effects on the morph@@ ometric spinal frac@@ tures Ac@@ up@@ a lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or several new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
ac@@ last@@ a @-@ treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
effects on acet@@ ate frac@@ tures showed a lasting effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) ac@@ last@@ a significantly increased bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.0 % , the lower spine by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology : 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with ac@@ last@@ a ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ sies from the basin .
a micro@@ computer @-@ tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture compared to plac@@ ebo .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal Pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and beta @-@ C teles@@ cop@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study duration .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ up@@ a reduced B@@ SAP significantly by 30 % in comparison to the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 28 % below the output value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the output value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the output value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion .
overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with acet@@ one compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , the ac@@ last@@ a treatment in comparison to plac@@ ebo treatment increased BM@@ D at the total and lower levels at all times .
for 24 months , ac@@ last@@ a treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % on the overall level and 4.3 % on the lower abdom@@ en than plac@@ ebo .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in ac@@ last@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once yearly administration of acet@@ one in comparison with the once @-@ weekly administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change in lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of the disease in the disease Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ up@@ a was studied in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , particularly mild to moder@@ ately severe disease Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean ser@@ um mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponding to 2.6 times up to 3 times the age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron juice in comparison to the intake of 30 mg ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for ac@@ last@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron .
patients who were classified as a Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
the 143 with acet@@ oni@@ as and 107 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at were able to maintain therapeutic response in 141 patients treated with ac@@ last@@ a compared to 71 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron in an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ off and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron juice in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ si@@ cally independent .
after that , the plasma levels rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the highest value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the highest value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearance from the large circulation system with half @-@ life time t ½ a 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a prolonged period of elimination with a terminal elimination time t ½ g 146 hours .
the early stages of distribution ( α and β , with the above mentioned ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent rapid res@@ or@@ ption into the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose can be found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the overall Clear@@ ance amounts to 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the tin @-@ acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearing of metaboli@@ zed substances by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzymes is unlikely , because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron juice is not metaboli@@ zed by humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the C@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron Aci@@ d cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function disorder up to a cre@@ atine @-@ clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
because there is limited data for severe kidney dysfunction ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- feel &lt; 30 ml / min ) , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ ally acting intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C , 6 times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous use , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was administered in rats using doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , administered in intervals of 2 @-@ 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose equivalent to 7@@ times the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C , equivalent ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated exposure to cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions that sufficiently exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects were observed in other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as on the intraven@@ ous injection site .
the most frequent follow @-@ up in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an inf@@ estation that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) de@@ formi@@ ties and such a skel@@ eton .
in rab@@ bits no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low ser@@ um calcium levels .
if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .

July 2007 , amended on 29 September 2006 , the Pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application is and works before and while the product is marketed .
risk management plan The holder of approval for placing on the market under@@ takes to carry out studies and additional activities related to the Pharma@@ ko@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance , which are presented in the Pharma@@ ko@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the approved version 00@@ 4 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) in Module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application and all subsequent versions of the R@@ MP approved by CH@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP directive for risk management systems for human medicines , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which may affect the current statements on safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minim@@ ise risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) has been reached . • On request of E@@ MEA .
z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease Pa@@ get of the bone .
dec@@ lining blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens formed of and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
in the case of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction takes place too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ structured , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
ac@@ last@@ a works by norm@@ alizing the bone structure , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus gives the bone strength again .
if you are in dental treatment or undergoing dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with ac@@ last@@ a .
when using ac@@ last@@ a with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you are taking other drugs / applying / applying them recently , even if they are not prescription drugs .
it is especially important for your doctor to know if you use drugs known to damage the kidneys .
when using ac@@ last@@ a together with food and beverages , you are worried that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you should take plenty of fluids before and after treatment with Ac@@ up@@ a .
the usual dose is 5 mg once a year , administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
if you recently broke the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of acet@@ amin@@ a two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
since Ac@@ up@@ a works for a long time , you may need another dose only after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ up@@ a can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ up@@ a is missed , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before ending the treatment with Ac@@ up@@ a If you are considering termination of treatment with Ac@@ up@@ a , please consult your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion perform very frequently ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , however , following the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions , however , less frequently .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ up@@ a .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ up@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you received ac@@ last@@ a .
physical signs due to a too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or de@@ af feeling , especially around the mouth .
influ@@ enza , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , ti@@ redness , ting@@ ling , trem@@ bling , temporary loss of consciousness , pain , diar@@ rhe@@ a , stomach upset , stomach pain , hyper@@ tension , skin pain , short breathe , skin rash , swe@@ ating , it@@ ching , red@@ dish skin , frequent ur@@ ination , temporary increase of ser@@ um cre@@ atine , tissue cor@@ ru@@ gation and thirst .
persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in mouth or jaw were reported above all in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates due to other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects significantly affect you or notice side effects that are not listed in this use information .
if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
in patients with a recently received low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture it is recommended to perform in@@ fusion of acet@@ amin@@ a two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of acet@@ one , patients must be adequately supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important for patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
because of the rapid insertion of the effect of cit@@ ric acid to bone reconstruction , temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atically running , hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia may develop , the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of ac@@ last@@ a .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of acet@@ oni@@ a .
in patients with a recently received low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of acet@@ amin@@ a .
if you require further information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
compli@@ a is also applied to diet and exercise to treat adult patients with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above , respectively , which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond one or more I
in addition , four studies were carried out in more than 7 000 patients , in which , in comparison to a plac@@ ebo , the drug was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for setting smoking .
however , studies on the attitude of smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of compl@@ ains on this field of application was difficult to assess .
what risk is associated with A@@ compli@@ a ? he The most common side effects of ants , observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) , were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and upper respiratory infections .
it may not be applied in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or being treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , since it can strengthen the risk of depression and , among other things , cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients .
care must be taken with the simultaneous use of remedies such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a means of use in HIV infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . LN
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of compl@@ ains regarding weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight people
treatments applied to patients who need it for health reasons and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing information packages for patients and physicians ) , and around the ar@@ z
it supplements diet and exercise to treat obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also have one or more risk factors n@@ g such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see section 5.1 ) .
compl@@ ac@@ ency is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 based on the lack of data on effectiveness and safety .
La depres@@ sive diseases or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts with up to 1 % of patients receiving ri@@ ms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in the case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be applied unless the benefit of the treatment in individual cases out@@ weighs the risk ( see paragraph 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
he is also present in patients who - besides obesity - have no noticeable risks , and can cause depres@@ sive reactions .
relatives or other close @-@ up persons may point out that it is necessary to monitor the new appearance of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• Ol@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months had completed studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .
Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , St. John &apos;s wort , has not been studied , it is assumed that the simultaneous dispens@@ ation of potent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tors increases the plasma concentrations of ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in
we have examined overweight patients as well as in patients with obesity , and in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in other indications .
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects that occurred under treatment in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in patients treated for weight reduction and for accompanying metabolic diseases .
if the incidence was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ate ( for un@@ desirable effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for adverse events &lt; 1 % ) .
very often ( ≥ 10 % ) ; often ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rarely ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä
only mild symptoms were observed in a case study in which a limited number of persons were given a dose of up to 300 mg .
the patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ d@@ emia .

patients with black skin color can have up to 31 % lower C@@ max and a 43 % lower AU@@ C than patients of other ethnic populations .
n popular mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analyses ( age spectrum 18 - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 % year old patient has an increase of 21 % higher C@@ max and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 year old .
5.3 Pre @-@ clinical data on the safety of the following adverse reactions , which were not observed in clinical studies but which occurred in animals after exposure to the human therapeutic area , were evaluated as potentially relevant for clinical application :
in some , however not in all cases , the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions appears to be associated with proced@@ ural stress such as dealing with animals .
when Rim@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period prior to mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed recovery from the initial effects of ri@@ ms , no adverse effects were observed on fertility or cycle disturbances .
the influence of ri@@ ms on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was investigated at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposition with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behavior or memory .

abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Employment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has judged the trials carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medication ) is not indicated .
it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) that cannot be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic resin or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the account treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic acid or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , so type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted .
in more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of acet@@ ylene in Tri@@ ple@@ Therapy has been evaluated ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in containing a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of an additional injection of acet@@ ate for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic acid showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional injection of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , patients who received Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were vision disturbances , upper respiratory infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ esth@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos should not be used in patients who may react hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high level of ket@@ one levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with Met@@ form@@ in in patients during single use , where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for the marketing of Ac@@ tos in the whole European Union .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , conve@@ x and carry on one side the markings &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the use in this age group is not recommended .
for patients who are at risk of developing at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and e@@ dem@@ a when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease has been carried out .
this study showed an increase in reports of heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output h@@ ep@@ atic cells ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , abdominal pain , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme levels are to be checked .
the decision , whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one continues , should be guided by the clinical evaluation to the screening of the laboratory parameters .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected , which can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
as a result of a h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , a slight reduction of the mean ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3.1 @-@ 4.1 % ) and reduced ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is available as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic substance or as a double combination therapy with insulin , the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the launch , the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d indi@@ a , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , was reported by an occurrence or wor@@ sen@@ ing of a diab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a decrease in visual acuity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but promising doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients report about disorders of visual acuity ; appropriate ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures in random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies of the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C from pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the fact that , under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ ine and increased insulin resistance of the mother &apos;s animal are reduced and thus the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth is reduced .

these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and refrac@@ tive index of the lens as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ tis performed more frequently than in plac@@ ebo over three times the upper limit of the standard range , but less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic .
in an outcome study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher compared to plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one bz@@ w .
since its launch , it has rarely been reported about con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , however , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of reports of adverse events with regard to bone frac@@ tures in random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study extending over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms occurred .
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ ic@@ ome prolifer@@ ation activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which results in an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be demonstrated that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in case of an insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the start of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ lo@@ gi@@ cide ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient with insulin in spite of three months optimization period were random@@ ized to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to those receiving only insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical studies over one year , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was examined in a small study of type 2 diab@@ e@@ tics in a small study of 18 weeks .
in most clinical trials , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels and slightly , but clin@@ ically in@@ significant elevated LD@@ L cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced total plasma gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ lo@@ ids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
compared to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , while lower values were observed under met@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide .
in a study of more than 20 weeks Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the in@@ timi@@ dity tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , both about an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ised to receive either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is quickly absorbed , with peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in the plasma usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to efficacy in roughly three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minim@@ ally pronounced .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the rot@@ ting ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma elimin@@ ator time of unchanged Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ite is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral clearing of the mother substance are similar .
in to@@ xi@@ k@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that , under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ ine and increased insulin resistance of the mother &apos;s animal are reduced and thus the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth is reduced .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) were induced in the rat .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d indi@@ a resulted in an increased incidence of col@@ on tum@@ ours .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in another study for two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were studied with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or bili@@ la@@ cide .
in clinical studies over one year , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the in@@ timi@@ dity tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , both about an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
although the study was missing the target of its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to effectively use insulin .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were similar to that of another human insulin .
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , doses of acet@@ abul@@ ae may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package insert ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weigh@@ ed in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the marketing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the whole European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily when a rapid initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
for example , patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly by a more intensive insulin therapy may change the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of starch , brand ( manufacturer ) , type of insulin ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA as compared to insulin of animal origin ) can cause a change in dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when changing to acet@@ ate , it may be necessary during the first dosing or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change of animal on human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling , which are going over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients for other drugs taken by them .
4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which may occur in a non @-@ sufficiently controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and am@@ ni@@ otic death in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can lead to loss of consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es , and may end with temporary or permanent disturbances of brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Ac@@ tually - peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy : rapid improvement of blood sugar control may be associated with discomfort that are called acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .

hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , however , can gradually develop : • Real hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
diab@@ e@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Grade hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias involving un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration of activity is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with rapid and delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sion ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
based on conventional safety pharmac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular dangers for human beings .
it is recommended - after removing the Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane squee@@ zing bottle from the refrigerator - to increase the insulin temperature at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it is res@@ us@@ pen@@ ded according to the instructions for use .

ac@@ on@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , doses of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may need to be adjusted if administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S permission to transport Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id to the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin produced quickly must first be absorbed , followed by the amount of the long acting insulin .
3 In case of change to acet@@ ate in the patient a dosage adjustment is necessary , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
before travelling , which are going over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diab@@ etic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diab@@ etic patients who underwent major surgical procedures has shown that an intraven@@ ously given ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % compared to 4.6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration of action is about 7 to 8 hours .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diab@@ etic children ( between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .

this can happen : • If you take too much insulin , if you eat too little or leave a meal , if you are more than otherwise physically demanding
always put the closing cap of your Nov@@ o@@ Let Ready to finish if it is not in use to protect it from light .
• Det@@ ect the rubber membrane with a medical tube • always use a new injection needle for each injection a new injection needle in order to avoid contamination . • Remove the injection needle straight and firmly on Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let ( Figure A ) • Drag the large outer cap of the injection needle and the inner cap of the injection needle .
follow the steps below to avoid the injection of air and ensure proper dosage : • Ke@@ ep the inj@@ ections needle upwards • kno@@ ck a few times with your finger easily against the cartridge .
if air bubbles are present , they will accum@@ ulate in the cartridge at the top • Whi@@ le the injection needle continues to hold upwards , rotate the cartridge by a click in the direction of the arrow ( Figure B ) • Whi@@ le the injection needle continues to show upwards ( Figure C ) • Now , from the tip of the injection needle , a drop of insulin has to exit .
• Set the cap back on the ready pen so that the digit 0 stands opposite the metering brand ( Figure D ) • Control whether the pus@@ h@@ button is completely ind@@ ented .
if the pus@@ h@@ button cannot move freely , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The scale on the thumb cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the pus@@ h@@ button moves outward , while you turn the thumb cap • The scale below the push button ( press stud scale ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 • No@@ ise the highest number you can see on the press stud • Ad@@ dress the two numbers to get the pres@@ et dose • If you have set a wrong dose , simply turn the cap forward or backwards until you have set the correct number of units .
turn it until the pus@@ h@@ button is down and you feel a resist@@ or Take off the cap and set it up again so that the 0 of the dosing stamp is opposite .
make sure to press on the pus@@ h@@ button only during injection • Ke@@ ep the pressure button pressed completely after the injection until the injection needle is pulled out of the skin .
it may be incorrect • You cannot set up a dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in cartridge • You can use the residual quantity scale to estimate how much insulin remains , but you can not use it to adjust or select your dose .

aden@@ o@@ ic is used in patients that already show signs of de@@ bris , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or lymp@@ h nodes ( &quot; stones &quot; ) , which can lead to joint and bone damage .
if the level of ur@@ ic acid is still above 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first months of treatment , there may still be arthritis cases ; it is therefore recommended that the patients are taking further medicines for prevention of rheum@@ atism at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ o@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had transplan@@ ts , as it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to a plac@@ ebo ( plac@@ ebo ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study two doses of aden@@ omas ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared one year to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 m@@ g. a day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose levels of ur@@ ic acid in the blood was below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients receiving a dose of 80 mg per day and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once daily receive 120 mg of ur@@ ic acid in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl on the last three measurements .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under the plac@@ ebo case .
the most common side effects of aden@@ omas ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
especially in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic could be more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also be a higher risk of side @-@ effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already lead to pri@@ me@@ val deposits ( including one of the medical history known or currently available arthritis and / or arthritis ) .
if the ser@@ um acid levels are still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be taken into account daily .
efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated in patients with severe kidney function ( C@@ ret@@ an Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
transplan@@ t recipients Sin@@ ce there is no experience in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular diseases In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure , treatment with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ ain@@ es@@ ky medicines , acute rheum@@ atism can occur during the beginning of the treatment because the lowering of ser@@ um res@@ id@@ al pi@@ eg@@ els can initially be mobili@@ zed into the tissues of the tissues .
B. for malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical trials , mild ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to conduct a liver function test before the start of the treatment and in the further course according to clinical examination ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line cell was not performed with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O escap@@ ement can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ( an in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous administration of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at exposure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without a dose adjustment for f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .
in a study with subjects , 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x had a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
ant@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid molecule containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delays the absorption of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and causes a decline in the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ an@@ cies cannot be ruled out on the side effects of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or when performing dangerous activities , until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ atic group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study in phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences could be found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) side effects that could occur in the treatment groups of 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported more than once in all treatment groups , are listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials , severe skin ras@@ hes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions have been observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events reported during long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all cases of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to indications occasionally .

the AP@@ EX study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority under 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) ( see Table 2 and Figure 1 ) for the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both daily and AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the commonly used dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the reduction of ser@@ um res@@ id@@ al acid levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and was maintained throughout the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl got 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al impair@@ ment The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with ren@@ al impair@@ ment ( d. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of ser@@ um acid concentrations in subjects regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of studies ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data obtained from the open extension study in phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the ser@@ um acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of rheum@@ atics , so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against a g@@ out in the months of 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ out , which resulted in a complete dis@@ appearance of the stu@@ ds up to 24 months in 54 % of patients .
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving a long @-@ term treatment with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma concentrations time curve ( AU@@ C ) of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration were simpler and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ proportional .
for dos@@ ages between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in the AU@@ C is observed for f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is larger than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage of ser@@ um acid concentration was observed , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary bond to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration range obtained with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mar@@ ched f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as unchanged F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gates ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair was found as un@@ altered f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , acet@@ ylene oxide of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gates ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal kidney function .
the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased about 1.8 times from 7.5 μ@@ g in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites after ing@@ es@@ tion of multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase in bladder tum@@ ours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , with about 11 times the exposure to humans .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ metaboli@@ zation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been found that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
at high doses , which were about 4.3 @-@ times of human exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity , which was accompanied by a reduction of the Auf@@ zu@@ cht@@ ower and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats , occurred .

in some people the ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach levels that are so high that ur@@ ic acid is in@@ soluble .
if you keep the levels of ur@@ ic acid low by the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the formation of the crystals is prevented and in this way a reduction of the discomfort is achieved .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may not be taken , if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other components of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
tell your doctor before you start taking this drug , if you have a heart weakness or suffer from any other heart problem . • If you are treated with a high ur@@ ic acid concentration in the result of a cancer or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disease where too much ur@@ ic acid is found in the blood ) .
if you have a stroke in the moment ( sudden appearance of severe pain , sensitivity to pressure , redness , feeling of warmth and joint swelling ) , wait until the infection is cleared before you begin treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
this does not have to be with everyone , but may also occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months , when you take AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie down until the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used separately from each other in medicines approved in the European Union , the company presented data origin@@ ating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who only received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds to the dose required to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , ul@@ c@@ ers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of the es@@ oph@@ agus , dy@@ sp@@ ag@@ gia ( swal@@ lowing ) , infl@@ amed abdom@@ en ( b@@ lower abdom@@ en ) and acid falling .
in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 , or any of the other ingredients , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used .
it must not be applied in case of diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . approval for the placing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on the one side and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ ation . • Pati@@ ents should not lie before the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
e.g. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal ble@@ edings or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , can be given only under special caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al responses , such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ent@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients under the sei@@ z@@ ure of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially they were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore atten@@ tively pay attention to all signs and symptoms pointing to possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to stop the drug in case of symptoms of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ag@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ grade pain or new or deteri@@ or@@ ating heart@@ burn ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or continue to take it after the occurrence of symptoms pointing to a malign@@ ant irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
whereas in large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , the stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ deficiency of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , has been reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men predominantly intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available which indicate whether the removal of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a surgical procedure decreases the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the treating physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases that affect the metabolism of minerals ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
patients must therefore wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials with a large number of commonly prescribed medicines without having clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ deficiency of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports date from cancer patients , but also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis .
nevertheless , the ser@@ um @-@ calcium decreases up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and ser@@ um phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0,@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at In@@ cen@@ tives of an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , and side effects in the upper ga@@ stro intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , e@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .
col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D3 ) Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light on the conversion of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ mes to vitamin D3 .
the main effect of 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 is to increase the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of ser@@ um calcium , the ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption .
in severe cases , a deficiency to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ acia may lead to an increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic persons .

after 15 @-@ week treatment , the average ser@@ um levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) than in the group under Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18,@@ 2 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) significantly reduced the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( ser@@ um value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs .
the therapeutic equilibrium of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate once a week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multic@@ enter study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two Phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in phase III studies , BM@@ D &apos;s middle asc@@ ents tot@@ aled 10 mg / day in relation to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % on the drop@@ side .
in the group treated with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a 48 % reduction ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % compared to plac@@ ebo , 6.2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more spinal frac@@ tures .
during the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the BM@@ D asc@@ ents of the spine and drop@@ han@@ ter continue to grow ; also the BM@@ D of fem@@ oral and the whole body was maintained .
it consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. daily for 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new spine by 47 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15,@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption Ex@@ trac@@ ted to an intraven@@ ous reference dose , the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women was 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after night and two hours before a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distri@@ butions of rats have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion Accor@@ ding to intraven@@ ous dosage of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the rot@@ ting .
following intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic Clear@@ ance exceeded 200 ml / min .
in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs is affected by these transport systems in humans .

the average maximum concentration in the ser@@ um ( C@@ max ) of vitamin D3 was 5.@@ 9 n@@ g / ml and the medi@@ an time up to reaching the maximum ser@@ um concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .

Adv@@ ance is administered to adult patients who have transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver in order to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already being used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously completed studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplantation , with the application of Adv@@ ant@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a period of treatment ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a re @-@ recording of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , further studies on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation were carried out and examined how Adv@@ ance is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , Adv@@ ant@@ f may not be used .
patients and physicians must be careful when other ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken at the same time with Adv@@ ant@@ f as the an@@ agra@@ f dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be appropriately adapted .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dose ; changes in the formulation or regime should only be performed under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of a change to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ ant@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of re@@ pul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood reflection provisions ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley mirrors should be checked before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as valley level , was comparable with both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley level are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t under Adv@@ ance in order to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate after@@ market phase .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low clearance substance , an adaptation of the an@@ agra@@ ph can take several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition does not allow oral consumption of drugs in the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application To supp@@ ress transplan@@ t rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , the maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ance therapy should begin at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily donation in the morning .
further dosage adjustment can be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after transplantation .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ance therapy should begin at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily donation in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f M@@ ust a transplan@@ t recipient of twice daily dosage of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules can be converted to a once daily intake of Adv@@ o.@@ f , this conversion has to take place in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose .
ren@@ al and liver transplantation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va to Adv@@ ant@@ f once a day , treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ ts must begin for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplantation For adult patients who are converted to a@@ dec@@ agra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day in the morning .
although there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ o.@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ ted patients , patients with an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day were used in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood tal mirr@@ oring in the as@@ pi@@ red region , a reduction of the dose may be necessary in patients with severe liver dysfunction .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ in levels , a calculation of the urine leak@@ age and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
caution is recommended ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) when switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy .
recommendations on the valley level in full blood The dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of re@@ pul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the help of whole blood tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ k@@ mirror @-@ controls .
it is recommended to conduct frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley level during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ bottom levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled by pro@@ gra@@ f , dose adjustment , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could change the full blood circulation of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ ance is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may require several days before the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the level of blood in the blood does not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the Tal@@ mirrors of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in full blood are usually in the area of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were generally used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus lower or over @-@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or regime should only be performed under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which have proven to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation adv@@ ant .
for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and gra@@ ft recipients in children , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ated formulation adv@@ ant .
due to possible interactions which may result in de@@ composition of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other plant remedies during treatment with Adv@@ ant@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable variations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , pro@@ gra@@ f was seen as a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy that could be observed as aqu@@ eous humor or sep@@ tum hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ ant@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin l@@ esi@@ ons by appropriate clothing or use of a sun protective agent with a high protection factor .
if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered states of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and vision disturbances , should be a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.@@ g .
since Adv@@ ant@@ f contains hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose , special care is required for patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency , or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and thus increase or decrease the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels with simultaneous administration of substances which can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolic rate and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dosage accordingly ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction has been associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ co@@ tics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ media antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the rise in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus &apos;s effect on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 Hem@@ mer ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be metaboli@@ zed with medicines which are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormone exposure , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive actions should be particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus potentially decreases the clear@@ ances of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one , and can pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a low number of examinations on transplan@@ t patients do not suggest that , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va can often not be determined precisely because of the patient &apos;s disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
in the following , the side effects after their frequency are listed in descending order : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases such as other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants are often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infection ( viral , bacterial , my@@ co@@ tic , prot@@ o@@ zo@@ al ) .
cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal ( multi@@ focal ) leu@@ k@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ ant@@ f .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ties including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours in combination with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment .
due to its high molecular weight , low water solu@@ bility and high binding to er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it is assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ able .
mode of action and pharmac@@ o@@ co@@ tic effects On a molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ oli@@ tic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell interior .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain series of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ kin genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus inhi@@ bits the activation of T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , and the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to observations in the large studies where pro@@ gra@@ f was used for liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted multi @-@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was less common in the first year after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) .
in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , in 21.@@ 7 % of the cases for the formation of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be switched to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.0@@ 2 ) than the number of patients en@@ forced by Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no gra@@ ft rejection was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in lung transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ative syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
pancre@@ atic transplantation A multic@@ entre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed on 205 patients who simultaneously underwent a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ t based on a random@@ ized method of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to reach the desired valley level from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
the published clinical results of a mon@@ oc@@ entri@@ c study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after intestinal transplantation demonstrated an updated survival rate of 75 % in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ al transplantation ) under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower starting doses of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , which result in talks between 10 and 15 n@@ g / ml and recently transplantation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , An@@ n Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) .
factors such as low ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ rit and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher levels of clearance observed after transplantation .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly via the bile .
the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ oc@@ ation was approximately 10 % lower in cases of stable patients ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) in relation to the total daily dose .
it is recommended to conduct frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley level during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which have proven to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation adv@@ ant .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and e@@ dem@@ a .
28 confirmed acute rejection was 3@@ 2.6 % within the first 24 weeks of the Adv@@ ance Group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) and 29.@@ 3 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) .

Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the deficiency of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment of bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A patients suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it em@@ powers to the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but it is made differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood @-@ type episodes was &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers in the European Union .
dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of factor VI@@ II deficiency , according to the location and extent of bleeding and clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity in the corresponding period should not fall under the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk for the patient is over .
during the course of treatment , adequate determination of factor VI@@ II @-@ plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients can differ in response to VI@@ II , different in vivo recovery and exhibit different half @-@ life times .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II @-@ plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled at an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II @-@ therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered .
the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded after finding the patient .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against Factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml of plasma by modified Beth@@ es@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to Factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk is greatest within the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ or development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ r@@ ence of ( low @-@ positive ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women there are no experiences concerning the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s , which occurred in the largest number of patients , were inhibit@@ ors of factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of which occurred in previously untreated patients with a higher risk of formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10th - 14th postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the Factor VI@@ II@@ - M@@ irr@@ ors in the Plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values on the 15th post operative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 diagnosed with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to Factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient after 26 ex@@ positions with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) were found in a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or following previous exposure to Factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
previously untreated patients showed 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated patients with inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contam@@ in@@ ating proteins was analysed by investigating the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of antibody @-@ level anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , but otherwise no signs or symptoms occurred which indicate an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ yte were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions as part of the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reports about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated Factor VI@@ II acts as a factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( bas@@ eline of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 100 previously treated patients equal to or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to assess the benefit @-@ risk weighing as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which necess@@ it@@ ates filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , and decided to apply for further extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited officially granted the CH@@ MP Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) to withdraw his application for the marketing of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that bin@@ ds and supports other structures in the body ) is affected .
this is a type of virus genetically altered that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an aden@@ o@@ virus , which has been modified so that it cannot produce copies of itself and can therefore not trigger infections in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein produced by the non @-@ defect p@@ 53 gene in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered .
in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not function properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study with a patient who joined Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the lower abdom@@ en area , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had examined the company &apos;s answers to the questions he asked , there were still some questions un@@ answered .
based on the review of the submitted documents , the CH@@ MP generates a list of questions that will be sent to the company on day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore brings benefits to the patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration as well as the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company has not adequately demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people coming in close contact with the patient .
the company did not know the CH@@ MP about whether the withdrawal had consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ passionate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modified substances release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are put together in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , nas@@ al infections caused by allergy to p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ( nas@@ al nose ) .
for adults and adolescents aged 12 and older , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is a tablet twice a day , which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cleared .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug can be reli@@ eved on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main factors were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y@@ fever symptoms reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard sc@@ ala how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in the case of all hay fever symptoms , apart from the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who received aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients who received pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under a@@ a@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients receiving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart hunt ) , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other components , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another drug for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze should not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ ph@@ al hyper@@ tension ) , or even an hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke ( stroke ) or a risk of an hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued an approval to the SP Europe company for the marketing of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the whole European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without bit@@ ing , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) .
due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have gone down .
it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days since the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine decreases over time in long @-@ term applications .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued as mono therapy if necessary .
as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or respectively within 2 weeks after the end of such therapy .
this can be attributed to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ id , th@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , which can be performed per@@ enni@@ ally or nas@@ ally as ab@@ norm@@ alities ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ mor@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ h@@ ash@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been examined for this group of patients and the data will not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
safety and efficacy of a@@ a@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is insufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that the treatment must be stopped in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or head@@ aches ) .
in the treatment of the following patient groups , caution is advised : • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines can otherwise prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions .
in the course of clinical trials involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions were observed or changes in the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with either des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether or not they were taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
in vitro studies have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and is neither a medium nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ os@@ ols during pregnancy is not assured , but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities in comparison to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ os@@ ols should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness that can lead to impair@@ ment of traffic or the ability to operate machinery .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible le@@ thal deformation .
headache , anxiety , ag@@ grav@@ ated mi@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ illary star@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesive molecule P sel@@ ec@@ tivity on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ qu@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement values of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical studies , no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo was detected at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage may evo@@ ke other sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic effects such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients between the ages of 12 and 78 took part in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , receiving 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall score for the symptoms ( except the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets did not show significant differences regarding gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics by Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ qu@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma .
after the per@@ im@@ al application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the body weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study , which was conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , four subjects of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poorly metaboli@@ zed .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was bio@@ equivalent to exposure to an aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional safety pharmac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not identify any particular dangers for humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and the Pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance System described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and tears or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
20 In certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ cous membrane of ab@@ pregn@@ ating medicine pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is contained in this drug .

tell your doctor if you are diagnosed or diagnosed with the following symptoms or diseases under the use of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • High blood pressure • heart@@ beat , pal@@ pit@@ ations • nausea and head@@ aches or a strengthening of existing head@@ aches .
if you take a@@ a@@ a@@ ze with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it even if it is not prescription drugs .
transport resistance and the operation of machines When used in the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze will lead to di@@ zz@@ iness or reduce the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform immediately your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you forgot to take Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the indicated side effects significantly affects you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .

after the launch of Des@@ cent at@@ adi@@ n , very rare cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , swelling ) or skin ras@@ hes have been reported .
about cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , in@@ som@@ nia with increased physical activity , over cases of liver inflammation and about cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver values was also reported very rarely .
it is available as 5 mg tablets , 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for intake ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg and 5 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively .
A@@ eri@@ us studied in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies on patients who also had asthma ) .
effectiveness has been measured by investigating the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ri@@ p@@ add@@ les , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to insert and the melting trays in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % , compared with the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies in Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the symptom scores were reduced after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued an approval to the company SP Europe for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience in clinical studies of efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease process and may be termin@@ ated after the symptoms have been dis@@ rupted and resum@@ ed again .
the persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions haven &apos;t been found in clinical studies involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which can lead to impair@@ ment of traffic or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most common adverse events reported more frequently than in plac@@ ebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , this occurred with 5.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and in 6.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ disciplinary study , administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dosage ) .
this includes both inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion gene P sel@@ ec@@ tivity to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
there was no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect as part of a clinical study with multiple doses given to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day for 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval proved .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ qu@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement values of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the total live scores of the questionnaire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively decreases the stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was sub@@ stituted for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , irrespective of the eti@@ ology of the different forms , is similar and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited as pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since hist@@ amine release is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n will also lead to an improvement in symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and lowering the size and number of quad@@ ri@@ p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement in the stimulus rate by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of the treated patients compared to 19 % of those treated with plac@@ ebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us greatly reduced the disorder of sleep and wak@@ efulness as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study in which the patient bi@@ ographies were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely ruled out .
in vivo , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and in vitro studies have shown that the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 drug is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg meals ( fatty , calorie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies conducted by lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a comparable degree to the exposure of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional safety pharmac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data available to support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examination and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children from 2 to 11 years of age are metaboli@@ zed and experienced a higher substance load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children aged between 2 and 11 years , which is fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who metaboli@@ se normal .
this drug contains sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol , so patients should not take this medicine with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions haven &apos;t been found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol was not ampli@@ fied while consuming alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged between 2 and 11 was similar to the plac@@ ebo group in the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than those treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ disciplinary study involving adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dosage ) .
children between 1 and 11 years of age , who were eligible for anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily diet of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
there was no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect within the framework of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered for up to 20 m@@ g. a day for 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in adults and adolescents , which was administered in the des@@ cal@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo was noted .
at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were not affected by psych@@ om@@ otor impair@@ ment in adults and adolescents in clinical trials .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not increase the alcohol @-@ induced impair@@ ment of the power nor to increase drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the total live scores of the questionnaire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and lowering the size and number of quad@@ ri@@ p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this fully metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations bigger at bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are restricted .
the strain ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ cent at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max about 3 to 4 times higher with a termin@@ ale half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant substance accumulation after daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C and C@@ max values of di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were comparable in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients in the recommended doses compared to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is available in type III bracelet with child @-@ proof polypropylene seal cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
equipped with a rigid , transparent polystyrene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application sy@@ ringe for preparation with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) .

in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets than those treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ disciplinary study of up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) .
in two single dose studies A@@ eri@@ us ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate was tolerated well ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
there was no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect within the framework of a clinical study with multiple doses in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered for up to 20 m@@ g. a day for 14 days .

there is limited experience in clinical studies on efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before use , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melt tablet is removed without damaging it .
efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of processed tablets in children under 6 years of age have not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the dis@@ su@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and plac@@ ebo group was the same and did not significantly devi@@ ate from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us processed the melt tablet as a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formula and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for the engaging formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged between 2 and 11 was similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
in infants between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported more frequently than in plac@@ ebo were diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , at a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no adverse events were observed in patients between the ages of 6 and 11 .
at the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ cent at@@ adi@@ n ( see under section 5.2 ) were comparable in children and adults .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo was noted .

if you have forgotten the intake of A@@ eri@@ us melt tablet If you have forgotten to take your dose in time , take it as soon as possible and then follow the normal treatment plan .
after the launch of A@@ eri@@ us , very rare cases of severe allergic reactions ( difficulty breathing , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , swelling ) and skin rash are reported .
A@@ eri@@ us solution for taking is indicated for children between 1 and 11 years , teenagers ( 12 years and older ) and adults , older people included .
if the solution is attached to inser@@ ting an application sy@@ ringe for preparation with sc@@ aling , you can use it as an alternative to take the appropriate amount of solution for taking .
regarding the duration of treatment your doctor will determine the type of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s you are suffering from , and will determine how long you should take A@@ eri@@ us solution for taking .
however , in children under 2 years of diar@@ rho@@ ea , fever and in@@ som@@ nia were common side effects while adults fatigue , bad breath and head@@ aches have been reported more often than with plac@@ ebo .
97 A@@ eri@@ us solution for insertion is available in bottles with child @-@ proof seal cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
the 150 ml packaging size is a measuring spoon or an application sy@@ ringe with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml cans .
in June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially informed the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company re@@ jects its application for approval for the placing of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus which could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
flu pan@@ de@@ mic occurs when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can spread easily from humans to humans , because humans have not yet built an immunity ( no protection ) against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; following the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts contained in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the immune system will later be able to form antibodies more quickly in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognizes the human body as a foreign body ) was puri@@ fied , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this did not extend the scope of the clinical data base to evaluate the safety of the vaccine to meet the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .
if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to intake , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination has not been studied .
ap@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined which an@@ tivi@@ ral drugs have previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of the virus being addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg k@@ night avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines .
in children between four and twelve years of age and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of at@@ ase after body weight is recommended .
in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
however , the damage to the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases related to AIDS can delay AIDS .
A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
this medicine , which was increased with low dose , was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors earlier .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the alteration of the viral load after treatment .
in the studies involving patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml than plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced viral load , but only very few of the children who had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were very few .
in the study involving adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the medicine am@@ assing increased with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase combined with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common adverse events of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who take St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines , which are also degra@@ ded as am@@ ases and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other remedies against HIV , the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( dying of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors over four years were out@@ weigh@@ ed against the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information is available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for the placing of A@@ gener@@ ase in the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ previously treated adults and children from 4 years of age .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ y of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be carried out taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and patient pre@@ treatment ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than the capsule of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not replac@@ eable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg . amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily with 100 mg k@@ night avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral remedies .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the reinfor@@ cing addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors have not been studied in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under the age of 4 , because of the lack of data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be treated with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and can also represent the medi@@ ums of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used as a result of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including antibiotic treatment , does not prevent the risk of HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
generally , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral remedies ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
in case of simultaneous an@@ tivi@@ ral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine .
patients with an existing h@@ ep@@ atic function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis also show an increased incidence of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and the supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the drug change of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of ad@@ mixture with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some drugs that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , am@@ n@@ ase may be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with AM@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is also given with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time , patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ ium , especially if also low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl alcohol content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
ap@@ general should be set out in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , or an exac@@ er@@ bation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus have been reported .
many of the patients had other diseases that could be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug addic@@ ts , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and the associated metabolic disorders .
in the case of hem@@ op@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge are present .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune deficiency , anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections that lead to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial et@@ ology is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis in particular were reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrates with a low therapeutic width of A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have low therapeutic width and can also display the medi@@ ums of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in attempting to balance the humili@@ ated plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse reactions to the liver were frequently observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um levels of Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r can be hum@@ bled through the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient is already taking St. John &apos;s wort , the amber mirrors and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered along with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increase for C@@ max by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r were performed twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % lower if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ night avi@@ r twice a day ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were obtained twice daily with the combination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for simultaneous administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but close monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but due to the an@@ ta@@ cide component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the revenue of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase lies at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose adjustment is required .
the treatment of cavi@@ ar in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and available limited data suggests that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine may reduce the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
should these drugs be used at the same time , caution is required as del@@ avi@@ r@@ ine might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
caution is advised when these drugs are used together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be performed , as accurate predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ ine is difficult .
the simultaneous dispens@@ ation of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in the plasma concentrations ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in a rise in the side @-@ effects associated with Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least one half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available for this .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been carried out , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in the plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to the 2,@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value , which after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was observed once daily without simultaneous use of fossi@@ ls with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other drugs that are listed below , including medi@@ ums , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to interactions if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with at@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as ap@@ athy , as it may cause res@@ or@@ ption disorder .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme @-@ induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine .
simultaneous intake of as@@ gener@@ a can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase the associated side effects with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the fluor@@ es@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected at the same time administration of A@@ gener@@ ase .
since plasma level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this medicine is not recommended with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zing the mirror is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used together with an or@@ ally taken Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while caution must be taken with the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data on simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other protein inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered along with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ ium , particularly if also low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given as to how the am@@ pren@@ atal dose is to be adjusted if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered with meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time .
simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase is recommended for increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the an@@ thro@@ mbo@@ tic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous administration of ap@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may be used only after careful balancing of the possible benefit for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known whether amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is passed into the breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the inc@@ iner@@ ation of the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during pregnancy .
the further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the dam .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most adverse events associated with A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely led to treatment failure .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether or not they are associated with taking ap@@ ori@@ asis or another medicine at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of patients , as well as under the treatment of any laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) are performed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and potential sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ a fat accumulation ( breast@@ feeding ) .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre @-@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - previously treated patients under Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r performed 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s for a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
skin ras@@ hes usually were mild to moder@@ ately pronounced , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ular nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred usually during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment had to be stopped with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune deficiency , anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600@@ mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily with low dose of doses ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and lab ab@@ norm@@ alities ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were similar ; an exception were elevated levels of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and CP@@ K values , which occurred in patients who received a@@ gener@@ ase together with low dos@@ ed k@@ night avi@@ r .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is aware of signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures are to be initiated .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the process of viral g@@ ag@@ - and g@@ ag pol@@ - poly@@ proteins with the result of formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both on acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is located in the range between 0.0@@ 12 and 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M with ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the relationship between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans has not yet been defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ ally not pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatments with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 trial , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic isolation of 13 of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors demonstrated resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occurred in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , following the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analyses based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to fossi@@ ls with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced lik@@ el@@ ihood of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four genetic samples associated with a reduced suscep@@ ti@@ bility to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r produces a certain cross resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistance between AM@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients in which a Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( one of them showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 Isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 Isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 insul@@ ates ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early termination of a failing treatment is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits , which may adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which patients treated with PI ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ kle@@ en@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose k@@ night avi@@ r .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ loss threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of efficacy is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 had been pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was tested twice daily in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dos@@ o avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients en@@ rolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an@@ ap@@ icul@@ ture should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increase , for C@@ max by 30 % lowered , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) was unaffected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food imp@@ acted the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r representing the active share probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates during dosing intervals depending on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 have to be administered with care if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
AM@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is of the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram@@ m@@ base .
also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of kidney dysfunction on the elimination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be negli@@ gible .
these treatment schemes lead to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained twice a day in healthy volunteers with a dose of 1200 mg .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas performed in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.8 @-@ times ( rat ) of the human exposure , after twice a daily dose of 1200 mg .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , showed little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vitro and in @-@ vitro diagnostic tests , containing bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test for rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical practice by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in clinical studies , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment .
studies of toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in a systemic plasma exposition , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus and minor skel@@ etal changes have been observed , indicating delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the reinfor@@ cing addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be done with caution in patients with weak or slight h@@ ep@@ atic dys@@ functions , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some drugs that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
ap@@ general should be set to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and the associated metabolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increase for C@@ max by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were obtained twice daily with the combination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for simultaneous administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but close monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
the treatment of cavi@@ ar in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
caution is advised when these drugs are used together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be performed , as accurate predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ ine is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available for this .
the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine .
in a clinical study where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the fluor@@ es@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase is recommended for increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the an@@ thro@@ mbo@@ tic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) resulted in a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % or more .
during pregnancy , this drug may be used only after careful balancing of the possible benefit for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given by the incorpor@@ ation into the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during pregnancy .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is aware of signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures are to be initiated .
the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is located in the range between 0.0@@ 12 and 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M with ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am@@ assing should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates during dosing intervals depending on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 have to be administered with care if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be negli@@ gible .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas showed ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas in dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2,000 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - ( rat ) exposure to humans after twice a daily dose of 1200 mg .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , showed little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings .

studies of toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that the metabolism path@@ ways are not fully mature in juven@@ iles , so that amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution to intake is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ previously treated adults and children from 4 years of age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; combined &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; azi@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solution to intake was not covered in patients with PI pre@@ treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than the capsule of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not replac@@ eable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since no dosage recommendations for simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase can be given to take and low dos@@ ages , this combination should be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated for inclusion in patients with ren@@ al failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ yl alcohol content , A@@ gener@@ ase is a solution to the intake of infants and children under the age of 4 , in pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk 47 of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some drugs that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
ap@@ nea should be set in duration if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug 49 dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and the associated metabolic disorders .
in the case of hem@@ op@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge are present .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increase for C@@ max by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous intake of as@@ gener@@ a can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase the associated side effects with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly improves the plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am following oral dosing of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution to intake may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the included prop@@ yl gly@@ col ( see section 4.3 ) .
in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known whether amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is passed into the breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the inc@@ iner@@ ation of the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight during pregnancy .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether or not they are associated with taking ap@@ ori@@ asis or another medicine at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ ally not pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatments with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
early departure of a failing 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits , which may adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am@@ assing should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large volume of ve@@ al volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

it can harm other people even though they have the same complaints as you . − If any of the effects listed you have significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
your doctor will usually instruc@@ t you to apply an@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to enhance the effect of ag@@ general .
the use of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor and your treatment history .
tell your doctor if you are suffering from one of the above diseases or take any of the above medications .
if your doctor has recommended that you take A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect ( boo@@ sting ) , make sure that before the beginning of treatment you have read the use information to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r carefully .
there is also no adequate information in order to recommend the use of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to ampli@@ fy the effect in children aged 4 to 12 years or in general in patients under 50 kg of body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore it is important that you read the section &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; When taking A@@ gener@@ ase with other medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before you start taking ap@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you may need additional Factor VI@@ II to control the bleeding . − For patients receiving an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , a re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat can occur .

the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied five times a week in case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , with four weeks of break between the treatment cycles , three times a week .
before bed@@ time , the cr@@ ème is thin @-@ lay@@ ered to the affected areas of the skin so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before being washed .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo held either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ours after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies involving 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ osis .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the total treatment rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with plac@@ ebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with plac@@ ebo compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application area of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ ato@@ tic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic nucle@@ at@@ osis ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults if the size or number of l@@ esi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or the acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .

treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream will continue to continue until all visible occur@@ ren@@ ces have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ an@@ al area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an interruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are healed only in@@ completely during follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose has been om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapeutic plan .
apply i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in a thin layer and apply in the clean@@ sed , infected skin area until the cream is completely absorbed .
it should be considered among these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should be considered among these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft vs. host reaction .
in other studies where no daily pre@@ h@@ ul@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and a case with a stro@@ kes leading to circumcision were observed .
in an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irrit@@ ations have been observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or have led to temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulties in ur@@ ination , requiring emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream immediately after treatment with other sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ unc@@ tions in the genital and peri@@ an@@ al@@ al area has not yet been found .
limited data suggest an increased rate of inclin@@ ation reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the elimination of sei@@ zur@@ es .
treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips or hair attachment has not been studied .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions proceed after completion of the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if it is necessary due to patient complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the treatment can be assessed after the treatment of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the treatment has ended .
since there is currently no data on long @-@ term treatment rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other appropriate therapeutic forms should be considered in super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs no clinical experiences are present , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours .
data from an open clinical study suggest that a lower chance of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy exists in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent cher@@ bat@@ ches on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lip .
there are very limited data on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of acute nucle@@ i in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose on the under@@ arms and hands does not support the efficacy of this application , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions proceed normally in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after sett@@ ling the therapy with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort or are very strong to the patient , the treatment may be exposed for several days .
data from an open clinical study revealed that patients with more than 8 active l@@ esi@@ ons showed a lower overall cure rate than those with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine should be applied with care in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although quanti@@ fiable ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) can be achieved neither after one @-@ time nor after multiple topical application , no recommendation can be given for use during breast@@ feeding .
the most frequently shared and prob@@ able or possibly associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in related adverse events in the trials with three times weekly treatment were local responses to the location of the treatment of the be@@ ers ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
the most commonly reported and prob@@ able or possibly associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in the context of side effects include discomfort in the application area with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the BC@@ 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream treated bas@@ ali@@ oma patients from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trial in phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common , probably or possibly associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in the context of adverse effects were in these studies a response at the location ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
the adverse events reported by 25@@ 2 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ ato@@ sis are listed below .
the clinical indication fores@@ een according to the study plan shows that these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials often resulted in local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cl@@ ori@@ ation / fl@@ atten@@ ing ( 23 % ) and e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
this evaluation of clinical signs provided by the study plan shows that in these studies involving five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream very often occurred to severe er@@ y@@ topics ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and to severe tumour formation and sc@@ aff@@ ing ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials for the treatment of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of the ac@@ tin@@ ical Ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or around the surrounding area .
the in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ent or@@ al absorption of 200 mg is@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clinical severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was in hyp@@ ot@@ onia norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigations , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies it was shown that efficacy in relation to full healing of the eig@@ ni@@ ces in an i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment is clearly superior .
at 60 % of the total of 119 patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine , the cervi@@ x war@@ ts healed completely ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients who had treated plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , compared to 5 % of 161 male patients treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in five times per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically healed and this remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment @-@ free time period , was examined in two double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic active l@@ esi@@ ons within a co@@ hesi@@ ve 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the scal@@ p or face .
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies indicate a recur@@ r@@ ence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
the permitted indications of external events , ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ ato@@ sis and super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not investigated .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively ) .
minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three times weekly application for 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations of drug in ser@@ um at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and num@@ bed 0.1 , 0,2 and 1,6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 p@@ ou@@ ches ) .
the estimated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine after topical application on MC @-@ affected skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with acute core cell carcin@@ oma or super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study on the der@@ mal application conducted for four months resulted in no similar effects with the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not in@@ duce tum@@ ours in the application area .
the corresponding mechanism is unknown , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine only has low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , a risk for man due to systemic exposure is regarded as very low .
the tum@@ ours were present in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme sales in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( symptoms which are not associated with brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not broken down and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage it .
the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , which complic@@ ate movements , decreased lung capacity , heart and eye diseases .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be administered in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alizing devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study was mainly focused on the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness has also been measured ( by examining its effect on the reduction of the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered G@@ AG concentrations in urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children exhibited a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion center .
very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measure of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated rate of heart ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may react strongly hyper@@ sensitive to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information every year , which may be known , review and , where necessary , update this summary .
the producer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the Company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the marketing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ ali@@ an cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Ei@@ erst@@ ock of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions defined as any associated side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be performed in an appropriate clinical environment in which re@@ vit@@ alizing facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that virtually all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions have to be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment it is necessary to proceed cau@@ ti@@ ously .
treat 60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minimize the potential incidence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a slight or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in the event of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms have been reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shall be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous response has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
experimental studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that were exposed to larv@@ ae about breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related responses , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older for a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table following the following frequencies : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history severe reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing and facial oil ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug effects related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a Phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe exp@@ ir@@ ation form and treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , a ser@@ um conversion occurred within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment , whereby the patients at the age of 5 came to a ser@@ um conversion in the age of 5 ( average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to early retirement from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients showed no det@@ ectable antibodies by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ recip@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients with whom it was never released .
patients with missing to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , while a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was detected in patients with high antibody ti@@ tre .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not seem to interfere with the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of un@@ desirable drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme sub@@ stitution therapy is one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ats and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of enzyme activity .
following IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes most likely via man@@ can @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study involving 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study covering the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients had the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( Fe@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change in the expected Fe@@ V and the absolute en@@ roll@@ ment in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me each week for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me compared the plac@@ ebo group to improve lung function and sal@@ vi@@ ability shown in the following table .
in the open extension study , an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects ran@@ ged from up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group and of 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as highlighted in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage Fe@@ V is not clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased further proportion@@ ately to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with an H@@ ep@@ atom@@ il@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a significant drop in the G@@ AG @-@ level was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
regarding the hetero@@ geneous manifestations of disease between patients taking into account clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficiency variables ( expected percentage normal Fe@@ V , distance in 6 @-@ minute walk , movement area of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted , in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were 5 years old at the time they were admitted ( 16 patients with the severe follow @-@ up form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ ag@@ - M@@ irr@@ ors in Har@@ n in Week 22 .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe delay form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed whereas in the older patients with severe delay form were limited or even no progress in cognitive development .
in a Phase 4 study , investigations into pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage regi@@ mens were performed on the G@@ AG mirrors in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosage schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years of age was similar to that of elderly and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional safety pharmac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity with a unique gift , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular dangers for the human being .
since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines , except those listed under 6.@@ 6 .

this register will receive longer @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , is either in small amounts or this enzyme is completely absent .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , or if you have an allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase occurred .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines please inform your doctor if you take medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a possible risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , including non @-@ prescription drugs .
advice on the handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to the application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for physicians and medical personnel ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditional involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing and facial oil .
very common ( occurrence for more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • rash • joint disease , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Incre@@ ased pulse • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion center

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( medicines for cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread slightly to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell .
in patients who have not previously been treated , A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) during the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ eme@@ tics &quot; ( remedy against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) should be given before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood pattern changes or where certain other side effects may occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , lowered or the dose decreased .
the active form of p@@ emet@@ ry thus slow@@ s the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the transformation of p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier to take in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and longer active duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was investigated in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
in addition , A@@ lim@@ ta was compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin showed an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months with the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies , patients in which cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell were longer alive when ad@@ minist@@ ering A@@ lim@@ ta compared to the comparable medication .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued an approval to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for the marketing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the whole European Union .
each side @-@ through @-@ bottle must be released with 4,@@ 2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is taken from the pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for over@@ laid epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for over@@ laid plate @-@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the reduction of frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions must be given a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid in the day before and on the day of the p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed administration and on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period and for another 21 days after the last p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also need to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) during the week before the first p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
in patients who receive tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood pattern should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te counting .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place in consideration of the an@@ adi@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the preceding treatment cycles .
after the recovery , the patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
if patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA should be termin@@ ated if a ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose induc@@ tors or so on the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical trials showed no evidence that patients aged 65 years of age or over the age of 65 have an increased risk of side effects .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustments were necessary for patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which should be recommended for all patients recommended dose adjustments .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a reduction in liver function of &gt; 1.5 times higher B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - B@@ order value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; 3.0 times the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ fold the upper limit value ( for the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with respect to bone mar@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ os@@ count reg@@ ains a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number once again reaches a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia were deemed poll@@ uted if a pre@@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed must be instructed to use foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce the toxic@@ ity of treated toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid con@@ current non@@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients prescribed for a p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed therapy must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with a clin@@ ically significant accumulation of liquid in the trans@@ cellular space a drainage of the eff@@ usion prior to the p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed treatment should be considered .
5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , when this active ingredient is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible degradation of the reproductive ability by means of p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment course to obtain advice on the preservation of the sperm .
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g a day ) can result in a reduced re@@ occurrence of side effects .
it is therefore advisable to take care if high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be used in high doses for patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , during the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed avoided ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there is no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ - xed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy .
p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed may not be used during pregnancy , except when necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk of fo@@ etus ( see section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive ability is made by p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the start of treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking account .
it is not known whether p@@ emet@@ ry mixed into breast milk and unwanted effects in the nursing inf@@ ant cannot be ruled out .

serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insulin and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were occasionally reported in clinical trials with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , which is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
from clinical trials patients with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed therapy occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal intestinal per@@ fo@@ - ration , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ li@@ tis ) .
from clinical studies , occasionally cases of in@@ sti@@ tial in@@ suff@@ oc@@ ation with respiratory failure were occasionally reported in patients with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed treatment .
it was reported on cases of acute ren@@ al failure at p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were treated before , during or after their p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate that ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting important fol@@ lic@@ eous metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed works as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with several points of attack by blocking thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lap syn@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , and the logical enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ in- and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ enter , random@@ ised , easy @-@ blind Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ded ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant benefit of a medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month survival compared to those patients who were only cur@@ led with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients receiving the investig@@ ational medication ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the only C@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms resulted in an improvement in the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ enter , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy showed a medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and of 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T N = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the treatment effect on overall survival fell in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with N@@ SC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ) , in patients with squ@@ am@@ ous cell carcin@@ oma ( n = 0.0@@ 47 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a separately random@@ ized , controlled phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ emet@@ ry mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination opposite the gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
middle P@@ FS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.0@@ 4 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 30.@@ 3 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1.4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine to c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of N@@ SC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = magnitude of population population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = hazard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ compliance level of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin needed fewer trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) , er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) and thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.0@@ 02 ) .
in addition , patients required the administration of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n / dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ eti@@ n ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.2 % , p = 0,@@ 00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4.3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed as a mono@@ therapeutic agent were studied in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tum@@ ours ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fu@@ si@@ - ones over a period of 10 minutes .
p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose will be found in urine only 24 hours after the application .
p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and half @-@ life in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le dogs , which had received intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us inj@@ ections for 9 months , Tes@@ tic@@ ular changes were observed ( degeneration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ f@@ ere epitheli@@ al tissue ) .
unless used less , the storage times and conditions after the preparation are in the user &apos;s responsibility and should normally not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C unless the preparation / di@@ lution has taken place under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
solve the content of the 100 mg through @-@ pl@@ unge bottles with 4,@@ 2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de ( 9 mg / ml ) without preservatives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml of p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed .

each bottle must be released with a 20 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
23 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed when this active ingredient is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .

A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 100 mg of powder for the production of a concentr@@ ates for the production of an in@@ fusion solution A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg of powder for the production of a concentrate
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is used in patients who have not received previous chemotherapy for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma ( malign@@ ant disease of the ri@@ b ) in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , another drug for the treatment of cancer .
if you have kidney disease or previously had one , please discuss this with your doctor or hospital oth@@ ec@@ er as you may not have been allowed to receive A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
in case of any in@@ fusion blood tests will be carried out ; it will be checked whether your kidney and liver function will be sufficient and if you have enough blood cells to get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA to 49 .
your doctor may possibly change the dose or stop the treatment as long as it requires your general condition and if your blood levels are too low .
if you are also receiving c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , your doctor will ensure that your body contains sufficient water and you get the necessary medicines to avoid vom@@ iting before and after c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
if you have a liquid collection around the lungs , your doctor may decide to eliminate this fluid before you get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
if you are a child during the treatment or in the first 6 months after the treatment , please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
interactions with other medicines Please tell your doctor if you use medicines for pain or inflammation ( swelling ) , such as medicines called non @-@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) , including medicines that are not prescription ( like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) .
depending on the planned rec@@ tum of your A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in@@ fusion and / or the extent of your ren@@ al function , your doctor will tell you what other drugs you can take and when .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is a non @-@ prescription medicine .
a hospital nurse , nursing staff or a doctor will mix the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA powder with a sterile 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) before it is applied to you .
your doctor will prescri@@ be cor@@ tis@@ one tablets ( according to 4 mg of dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ son two times a day ) that you must take the day before , the day during and the day after the application of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
your doctor will prescri@@ be foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) to inhal@@ e or mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amins which contain foli@@ c acid ( 350 to 1000 micro@@ grams ) , which you must take once a day during the application of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
in the week before applying A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and approximately every 9 weeks ( corresponding to 3 cycles of treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ) , you will also receive an injection of Vi@@ - t@@ amin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) .
if a side effect is described as &quot; very frequently &quot; in this use @-@ information , this means that it was reported by at least 1 of 10 patients .
if a side effect is described as &quot; frequently &quot; it means that it was reported by at least one out of 100 patients but was reported less than 1 of 10 patients .
if a side effect is described as &quot; occasional , &quot; it indicates that it was reported of at least 1 of 1000 but less than 1 of 100 patients . if a side effect is described as &quot; rare , &quot; this means that it was reported by at least 1 of 10,000 but less than 1 of 1,000 patients .
fever or infection ( often ) : if you have a body temperature of 38 ° C or over , sweat or have other signs of infection ( because you may have less white blood cells than normal , which is very common ) .
if you feel tired or weak , quickly get into short@@ ness of breath or look pale ( because you may have less h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in than normal , which is very common ) .
if you notice a bleeding of the g@@ ums , nose or mouth , or another bleeding that does not come to a halt , or have a red@@ dish or pink urine or un@@ anticipated bru@@ ising ( because you may have less blood plat@@ el@@ ets than normal , which is very common ) .

it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ calorie , fat @-@ fat diet .
patients who have allergy and unable to lose weight after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metaboli@@ se some fats in the diet , causing about a quarter of the fats to be fed with food un@@ ch@@ ewed to the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared with a BM@@ I in 3@@ 91 patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2,3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , none of the relevant weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with a bow@@ el , Stu@@ h@@ ld@@ rang , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , Out@@ going O@@ rets ( rot@@ ting ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be applied to patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection of gra@@ ft patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( not enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or cholesterol ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for placing Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union .
all@@ i is inde@@ xed for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fat @-@ fat diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , since there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ bed , it is not necessary to adjust the dosage with older people and for patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or any other component • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption co@@ itus • Cholest@@ asis • lac@@ tation ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a low @-@ fat single meal or a fat rich diet .
since weight reduction in diabetes may be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of anti@@ diab@@ etic should be adapted if necessary .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures in order to prevent the potential of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on the interaction of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( internationally normal @-@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) may be influenced ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients who have been treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ins remain in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take a supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure adequate vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after receiving a one @-@ off dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal and related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rarely ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
the frequency of adverse events known after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events were reported voluntarily by a population of some size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety regarding potential or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and overweight patients without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects caused by the im@@ muni@@ zing properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect consists in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in residue of ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ atic li@@ pas@@ sions .
clinical trials showed that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , inhi@@ bits the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fat @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average dietary change in the Gesamt@@ cholest@@ erin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at waist circum@@ ference , the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( initial value : 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg of or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in the plasma could be detected only spor@@ adic@@ ally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0,@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of an accumulation .
two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ tone ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ Form@@ yl @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified in a study with obes@@ e patients ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ Form@@ yl @-@ Leu@@ cin group ) .

weight reduction is used for weight reduction and is used for overweight adults aged 18 and over with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 28 or over . all@@ i should be used in conjunction with a low @-@ fat and low @-@ calorie diet .
BM@@ I helps you determine whether you have a normal weight or overweight in relation to your body size .
even if these diseases do not cause you to feel uncomfortable , you should still ask your doctor for a check@@ up .
with the help of all@@ i , you can lose an additional kilogram for 2 kg of body weight you lose as part of a diet .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .

for further information on the blue pages in Section 6 , you can find out how to define your cal@@ ori@@ ent goals and fat death borders .
if you leave a meal or a meal does not contain any fat , take no capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat .
if you take the capsule in combination with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk nutritional benefits ( see Section 4 ) .
to get used to your new eating habits , start before the first capsule intake with a calorie and fat @-@ fat diet .
food di@@ aries are effective as you can understand at any time what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your eating habits .
to ensure your target weight is safe , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• E@@ at fo@@ ols down to reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of nutrition @-@ related symptoms ( see Section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the indicated side effects significantly affects you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
the most common side effects are associated with the effect of the capsules and result in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , as you may have not consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nutritional benefits : • Beg@@ in a few days , or better a week , before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood of you accidentally exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you are allowed to take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a substantial fe@@ ti@@ sh@@ er as you possibly have done with other programs for weight reduction . • Most people with those accompanying symptoms will learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • Do not store any rem@@ n@@ ants after the exp@@ iry date stated on the cardboard box . • Ke@@ ep container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .

obesity has an effect on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • High blood pressure • Diabetes • Heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis talk with your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
sustained weight loss , for example by improving diet and exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive effect on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find in food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should consume per day .
notice the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
the amount of calories that is suitable for you can be found in the information below , which indicates the number of calories which is suitable for you . • Due to the action of the capsule , compliance with recommended fats is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ise weight loss and at the same time reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms . • You should try to decline gradually and continuously .
34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose about 0.5 kg per week in weight without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Low physical activity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that you burn 150 k@@ cal daily , e.g. through 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gardening , or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
• For permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set up realistic calorie and fat targets and comply with them . • To be meaningful is a dietary diary with information on calorie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ ori@@ en- and fatty acids and give guidelines to become more physically active .
in combination with a program tailored to your type , this information can help you develop a heal@@ thier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are a strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , and chem@@ o@@ therapies that are moderate to nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicinal product that can be used as an anti @-@ eme@@ tics ) .
the use of patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , because there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the active agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong and moderate nausea and vom@@ iting .
in the 24 hours following chemotherapy , 59 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi@@ an were not vom@@ iting ( 132 out of 2@@ 23 ) , 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 from 2@@ 21 ) .
in the case of chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of the patients treated with Alo@@ xi were not vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 from 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the marketing of Alo@@ xi in the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in severe chemotherapy due to cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of a cancer .
the efficacy of alo@@ xi@@ on for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given to chemotherapy .
because Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on as@@ say , patients with am@@ ne@@ sty exposure or signs of a sub@@ acute idi@@ om should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable with simultaneous dispens@@ ing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or for patients with which the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to be prolonged .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not to be used either to prevent or treat nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not block the activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics examined against tum@@ ors ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron dose and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ation of oral Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , chlor@@ hex@@ et@@ ine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron Clear@@ ance .
experience for using Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies is not recommended , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events were observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , at least possibly associated with Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reaction to the location ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were given in post marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar occur@@ ren@@ ces of adverse events as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , but due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy for al@@ op@@ ying .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received moderate chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250@@ mg / m2 of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given intraven@@ ously in day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients who received 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously in day 1 .
results of the studies of moderate chemotherapy and the study of highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to preliminary clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the I@@ on channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular death and rep@@ lication and to pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the EC@@ G effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption following intraven@@ ous administration , a slow elimination of the plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ life of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ@@ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
following intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , 11 tes@@ tic@@ ular cancer patients ran@@ ged from day 1 to day 5 ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations show that the total tex@@ tual position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) reached at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to that after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ max was higher after the one @-@ time injection of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies for metabolism showed that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ therapy C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered agent made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bolt injection for healthy subjects , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the termin@@ ale elimination diet is increased and the average systemic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient for the maximum of human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing low relevance for clinical use .
10 Out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , evidence suggests that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular death and rep@@ lication and can pro@@ long the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in about 30 times the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , given daily over two years , resulted in increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , en@@ doc@@ rine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for the human being .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion in which the approval of the drug induced to treat hepatitis C was recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means Al@@ ph@@ é@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic investigation the liver tissue damages damage , moreover , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ in amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are elevated to the blood level .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates it to form the active substance .
Al@@ ph@@ eon manufacturers presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of patients with Hepatitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to the efficacy of the reference medicinal product to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients reported after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was stopped ( i.e. no sign of the virus was detected in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged What were the biggest concerns that prompted the CH@@ MP to agree to the placing on the market ?
in addition , concerns have been expressed that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed will not suff@@ ice .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease progres@@ sed again in more patients than with the reference medicinal product ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ é@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test carried out in the study to investigate the question of how far the medicine respon@@ ds to an immune response ( i.e. the body produces antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) are not adequately vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected in@@ fir@@ mi@@ ations ( crack or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for the treatment of infections , which are demon@@ stra@@ bly or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ seed resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go does not work against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years , the surface area to be treated may not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo spoke to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together in Hau@@ tw@@ unden , about 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ei@@ ter@@ stu@@ ffed cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the job site .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go were out@@ weigh@@ ed in the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ mi@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . approval for the placing on the market of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in case of a sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment the treatment should be stopped , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ines should not be used for the treatment of infections , in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of retin@@ am@@ in@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected position occurs after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ines and other topical remedies on the same surface area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ ewed skin or infected surface wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo is not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After a simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 m@@ g. of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the middle Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ entum AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ in- o@@ int@@ ment increased by 81 % on a reduced skin of healthy adult men .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dosage adjustment is not required if topical retention is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in terms of a statement regarding effects on birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy , if topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ines is prefer@@ able to the application of systemic antibiotics .
in deciding whether breast@@ feeding should be continued or stopped or the therapy should be continued with Al@@ tar@@ go , it is necessary to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of al@@ tar@@ go therapy for woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , which have applied al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported adverse effect was irrit@@ ation at the place of discharge , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of function Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ entum is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance which is isolated by fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us fitt@@ ed@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the active mechanism of retention is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a certain binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data suggests that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the pep@@ tide transfer centre .
by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interaction and prevent normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if , due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at at least some types of infection appears question@@ able , advice should be sought by experts .
there were no differences in the in vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ in- to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a healthy adult study , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion and applied to the skin for up to 7 days .
from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
samples were taken on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before the medication and children aged 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 was reduced to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the retina in@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP escap@@ ement .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ entum in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies of oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid disorders .
in @-@ vitro investigation on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma @-@ test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in rats @-@ micro@@ kernel @-@ test for in @-@ vivo examination of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
neither male nor female rats showed signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in an exposure of up to 5 times higher than the highest estimated exposure in humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 ) skin :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats , oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , develop@@ mental toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were detected .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ enza is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and fifteen years that are not immune to these two diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ enza is used within the framework of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby the protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the im@@ muni@@ zation and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination contained in two doses can be completed .
if a refres@@ her dose is required for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix may be given or another hepatitis B or B vaccine .
vacc@@ ines work by att@@ aching the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , as it can defend itself against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system detects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ambient rix contains the same components as the V@@ acc@@ ine @-@ Ad@@ ult approved since 1996 and the acc@@ ine of the children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are given a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence of the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ enza took a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations for hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar in a six @-@ month and a 12 month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , fatigue ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
ambient rix may not be used in patients who may react hyper@@ sensitive to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als a permit for the marketing of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the standard vacc@@ ination plan with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a booster dose for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B is desired , the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine can be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) antibody and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully secured if immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have responded to a hepatitis B vaccine require a booster shots as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory for non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate options for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the vaccine administered .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended , containing 360 ELISA units forming a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value after pri@@ ming , so that in these cases the gift of additional doses may be required .
since an intra@@ muscular injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal result , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in case of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disturbances , however , Ambi@@ rix may be sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously inj@@ ected because in these cases it may result in bleeding after intra@@ muscular administration .
if Ambi@@ rix is administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ el , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ x vaccine ( D@@ T@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or combined with a combined massage m@@ um@@ ps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it is necessary to assume that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ch@@ iness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was similar to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ isation and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants aged between 12 and 15 years , Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of the 3 @-@ dos@@ ed combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a basis of calculation per vacc@@ ination dose , but not on a basis of calculation per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ .@@ 7 % of the test subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in the subjects after a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given ambition had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the test subjects , who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ch@@ iness was comparable per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the whole vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix , compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dos@@ ed combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of severe pain and mat@@ ch@@ iness was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dos@@ ed vaccine .
in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ inations , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3 @-@ dos@@ ed combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11@@ - @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the share of vacc@@ inations that reported severe adverse events during the 2 @-@ doses @-@ vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with the combination of 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted on vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study carried out at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after the addition of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune responses , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ inations were either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be demonstrated over at least 24 months after im@@ muni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immun@@ ore@@ action observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme to the in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year at the same time was administered with the discovery of a combined diet , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ el , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ x vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for the previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing by examining any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .
in accordance with Rule 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , state batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by virus @-@ containing food and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways such as bathing in waters contaminated by sewage .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may possibly require a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix may not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series was completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B Virus prior to the administration of both vaccine doses ( though you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to that of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection can not be medi@@ ated .
• if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express itself by it@@ ching skin ras@@ hes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly protect hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the second vacc@@ ination dose is usually administered ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / her child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccine dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection prior to the end of the vaccine series .
sometimes , with people suffering from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , it is inj@@ ected under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s own defense / or if you / your child is undergoing a ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ enza can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child was recently vacc@@ inated / has received / has received immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) or is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as many extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nonetheless be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , Ambi@@ rix will not be given pregnant or lac@@ t@@ ating women , unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as Hepatitis B . &quot; &quot; &quot;
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ed doses ) : • pain or discomfort on the spot or redness • Mat@@ ch@@ iness • irrit@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite
♦ A frequent occurrence ( up to 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ed doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • drow@@ sin@@ ess • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal discomfort
other side effects reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 dec@@ im@@ ed doses ) are :

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data , which have become known since obtaining the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP believes that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was only placed in traffic in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to small patient exposure .
am@@ mon@@ ast@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of over one month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
Am@@ mon@@ ast@@ aps - split by several single doses to the meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed into the food or administered via a gastro@@ intestinal hose ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading tube ) .
it was not a comparative study , as Am@@ mon@@ se could not be compared with any other treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a fake medication , i.e. without drug ) .
am@@ mon@@ ast@@ aps can also result in loss of appetite , abnormal blood pressure , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevents too high ammon@@ ia values .
Am@@ mon@@ se was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information to this medicine is available .
the use is indicated in all patients with a complete enzyme shortage already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect that mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) there is an indication for use if a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake necessary for the patient &apos;s growth and development .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight above 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ cot@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency have to receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , as there is a risk of the development of es@@ oph@@ agus diar@@ rhe@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as associated with sodium retention and o@@ dem@@ a .
because metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate are carried out via the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is unknown ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal prolifer@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons occurred .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a decreased number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during lac@@ tation ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS 56 % of patients had at least one un@@ desired event ( AE ) and 78 % of these un@@ desirable events were assumed that they were not connected to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old abnormal patient who developed metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tic acid , severe hypo@@ c@@ emia , tank top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
an over@@ dose case occurred in a 5 @-@ month @-@ old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ denti@@ al single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms start with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound , which is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
sto@@ ich@@ i@@ omet@@ rically , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 Pati@@ ents with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram received sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that diagnosis is made early and treatment is started immediately in order to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was previously almost always inf@@ ring@@ ed , and the disease itself led to death itself in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with its nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues in the first year of life .
by h@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis , using alternative methods of nit@@ rate elimination ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns ( but within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ city deficiency ) , which recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical state may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in the liver and kidneys with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by adding a single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis for individuals as well as repeated gi@@ fting of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled studies ) .
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites were also studied in cancer patients based on intraven@@ ous dosage of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected 15 minutes after the intake .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cycle disturbances or ha@@ emo@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was not detected next morning after ni@@ gh@@ tly fasting , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma .
in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis who were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma levels were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts .
the medicine is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine through the kidneys .
following the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate had no g@@ un@@ har@@ dest effects with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( study 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who can &apos;t swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ pod or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight above 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( particularly bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ cot@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat @-@ fl@@ utes were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) before birth , l@@ esi@@ ons occurred in the pyrami@@ ds of the cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old abnormal patient who developed metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tic acid , severe hypo@@ c@@ emia , tank top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .

on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram received sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in the treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical state may occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ular form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected 15 minutes after the intake .
during the dur@@ ations of the shelf life , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of no more than 25 ° C .
the small measuring sco@@ op contains 0.@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spoon of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to receive the medicine by a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after eating proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it even if it is not prescription drugs .
during breast@@ feeding you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine will pass into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturbances , impaired hearing , dis@@ ori@@ enting , memory impair@@ ment and deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions have been observed .
if you encounter any of these symptoms , you immediately contact your doctor or with the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating a corresponding treatment .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in an unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of chest pain with different thick@@ nesses ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) ( abnormal measurement value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of angi@@ o@@ ox in case of a few administration or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with He@@ par@@ in ( another antibody ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI , the patient frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and A@@ spir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without administration of GP@@ I - in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year overall as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients undergoing a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in with regard to all indicators , except for severe bleeding , in which it was much more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other components .
it may not be used in patients who have recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for he@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd a permit for the placing of An@@ gi@@ ox in the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in an emergency intervention or when an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous 0.1 mg / kg stu@@ b followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is carried out in other cases , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours according to clinical requirements .
immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ o@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous injection of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an intraven@@ ous IV in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us administration from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be performed .
in order to reduce the incidence of low ACT levels , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted drug should be carefully bl@@ ended before use and the dose of the bol@@ us dose should be administered intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT att@@ aches to more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are undergoing a PCI ( whether treated with ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , it is recommended to admini@@ ster a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg and re@@ test the ACT 5 minutes after the second shot dose .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT att@@ aches to an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds following the application of the Bi@@ vali@@ date Bol@@ us without dose adjustment .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the IV administration of un@@ ques@@ tioning he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredient or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to mal@@ functioning of the hem@@ ost@@ asis system and / or ir@@ reversible intestinal endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if the most bleeding of the arter@@ ial points occurs in the case of PCI patients under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can generally perform bleeding during the treatment .
in patients receiving War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ dated Ru@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be taken into consideration in order to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din again reaches the pre @-@ treatment level .
based on the knowledge about the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ sis or thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations ) , it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ ine with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological stain@@ ing parameters are regularly monitored .
the experimental studies are inadequate in relation to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ ques@@ tioned he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ validation group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
heavy ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scales for severe bleeding like in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and heavy ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages performed significantly less often than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ validation Dru@@ dine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge in the punc@@ ture area requiring a radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in mirror ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding edge , re@@ operation due to a bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed bleeding @-@ loc@@ ali@@ zations that occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; points of point , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing PCI .
both in the Bi@@ validation group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages significantly decreased significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects not listed above were reported in practice after extensive use and are group@@ ed according to system organ classes listed in Table 6 .
in case of an over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ dated Ru@@ din must immediately break off and the patient closely monitor the signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox includes Bi@@ dated Ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ oid inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre and on the an@@ ion binding region of thro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether thro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din on thro@@ mb@@ ine , and thus its effect , is reversible , because thro@@ mb@@ ine , on its part , slowly cle@@ ans the bond of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine .
in addition , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din was unable to in@@ duce thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ sis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) in the past .
in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ dated Ru@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti @-@ inflammatory effect , which is demonstrated by prolon@@ ging ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was performed in the following cases , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ ine should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h should be increased .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study un@@ question@@ able he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to receive a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before beginning the angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or with PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed across the 3 arms .
about 77 % of patients had recurring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

A@@ pi@@ dra is administered sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin for the regulation of glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or can not effectively process insulin .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin differs very slightly from the human insulin and the change means that it acts more quickly and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been used in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body is unable to produce insulin , in two studies involving a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults with type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to operate effectively .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin sensitivity was observed after six months .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % with human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to in@@ ert lu@@ li@@ sin or any of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the whole European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the pancre@@ as .
due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism , the insulin requirement in patients with a limitation of the liver function can be reduced .
any change of the active strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc del@@ aying , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production can change the insulin requirement .
3 insufficient dosing or dis@@ continuation of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening .
changing a patient to another type of insulin or insulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the time of occurrence of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when changing the treatment plan .
the substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias include oral anti@@ diab@@ etic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ pyramid , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ cycl@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ lic and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics .
in addition , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ cs such as beta block@@ ers , c@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pine may be dimin@@ ished or absent from the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter @-@ regulation .
experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and Human@@ insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin dischar@@ ges into human breast milk , but generally insulin does not exceed the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it absorbed by oral application .
listed below are the un@@ desirable clinical trials adverti@@ sed by clinical studies , group@@ ed according to system organ classes and sorted according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( exceeding 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data is not predictable ) .
cold @-@ welding , cool and pale skin , ti@@ redness , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , drow@@ sin@@ ess , excessive per@@ sever@@ ance , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is missed to continuously change the injection point within the injection area , subsequently a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias involving un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by an appropriately trained person , or by intraven@@ ous glucose administration by a doctor .
after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to detect the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption ( especially skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that the efficiency occurs faster with sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin and the active duration is shorter than with a cou@@ gh @-@ man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes m@@ li@@ - tus , insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg showed a dose of proportional glucose @-@ lowering effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ m effect , just like human insulin .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ es@@ ick effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data it was obvious that a comparable post @-@ ran@@ ci@@ dental gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control is reached in an application of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal , as with normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
was insulin lu@@ li@@ sin adjusted 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al control was achieved than with a normal normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin is applied 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a similar gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ ds before the meal ( see figure 1 ) .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin for 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - previously ) before the start of the meal compared to normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin at the gift of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human normal @-@ acting insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
