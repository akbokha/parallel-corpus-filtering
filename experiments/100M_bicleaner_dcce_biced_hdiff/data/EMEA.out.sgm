<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Employment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has judged the trials carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you require further information about your disease or treatment, please read the package insert (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Cast thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), suspicions and delusions; • bipolar-I disorder, a psychic disorder, in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of anorexic high spirits) alternating with periods of normal spirits.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders if the oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used to insert or melt tablets in patients with difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">For patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abilify, the dose should be adjusted by Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This interferes with the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to one another.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "Aripiprazole is probably mainly known as" "" "partial agonist" "" "for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin)." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole is like 5-Hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters to activate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disease suffering from increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, in 160 patients with whom the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients suffering from bipolar disorder that suffered from increased unrest with that of Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies examined the change in the symptoms of patients based on a standard scala for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies in order to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and absorbs the solution.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased unrest than the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application to treat bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced in four of the five short-term studies manic symptoms more effectively than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented for up to 74 weeks more effectively than placebo the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injection in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for inhalation (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extra pyramidal disorders (uncontrolled bite), tremor, nausea, vomiting, nausea, vomiting (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disturbance) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disturbance as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients with predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were referring to the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of injection solution were outweighed in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not appropriate to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the placing of Abilify in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficacy in dosages above a daily dose of 15 mg was not demonstrated although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Considering the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 Inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazl dosage should be reduced to the recommended dosage (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no high suicide risk with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypogemia, treatment with hemostatic medicines) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia during treatment with Aripiprazesia.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients treated with Abilify are signs and symptoms of a late dyskinesia, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of a MNS or has unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at states associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response for undesired cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic active substances, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse events involving Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic active agents to allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polymers, polymorphism, polyphagy and weakness should be observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of anti-psychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary efficacy of Aripiprazl on the central nervous system, caution is required when Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally active pharmaceuticals with overlying side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blockers, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazl by 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolers, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher concentrations of Aripiprazl in comparison to CYP2D6 extensions.</seg>
<seg id="53">If one considers the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteaseinhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After settling the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibition the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose level before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be expected with a moderate increase in Aripiracy concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg. of Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextrophy / 3-methoxycycline ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextrophy).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used during pregnancy because of the insufficient data state for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in the reproduction studies at the animal, unless the potential benefit justifies clearly the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole did not have any negative impact on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Aripiprazole, overall lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, Akathouse, Dystonia and Dyskinesia compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients suffering from Aripiprazole and 13,1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole, and 15.1% in patients under scalpapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I disturbance - In a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under semi-operidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazole and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">During the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazl and Placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters emerged, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Adverse events related to antipsychotic therapy, and their occurrence in the treatment of Aripiprazole, include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or intentional acute overdosages with Aripiprazole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without cause of death.</seg>
<seg id="73">There is no information about the efficacy of haemoglobin in the treatment of overdosing with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hematalysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdosage as Aripiprazole has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated on the combination of a partially antagonistic effect on dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HTA receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro Aripiprazole showed a high affinity for dopamine D1- and D3-receptor and serotonin 5HT1 and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">When Aripiprazole was administered in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks in healthy subjects, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3-receptor ligands, at the Nucleus caudatus and on the puttest.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term trials (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenia patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 percent of respondents reported a response to the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales, defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery Asberg depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study for 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% lower than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Oscapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study involving schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective was' weight gain ', significantly fewer patients experienced weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a placebo superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazl showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and actively controlled monotherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazole showed a efficacy comparable to placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazole also demonstrated in week 12 a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania like lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirroring, the companion therapy with Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazl showed a superior response to the prevention of a bipolar backfall, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxymethylation of Aripiprazl, the N-Dealkylamation is catalysed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elioration time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole with extensive metabolism through CYP2D6 and at nearly 146 hours in 'bad' (= "poor") metaboleiers via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazl there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenia patients no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A simulation-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics did not reveal any clinically significant differences regarding ethnic origin or impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">The preclinical data did not identify any particular dangers for humans based on the conventional studies of safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans, so they have limited or no significance for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included dose-dependent adrenal-toxicity (lipofuscin pigmentation and / or parenchycell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase in adrenal-kidney cancer and combined ancillary rinds (AUC) at the recommended maximum allowance in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">Moreover, a cholelithiasis was found as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the Galle of monkeys after repeated oral doses of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81fold.</seg>
<seg id="98">However, at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of Hydroxy- Aripiprazole were no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of 3 and 11 times the average steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dosage.</seg>

<seg id="145">In order to increase resorption and minimize variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended under removal of adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status, taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acutely therapy (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazole, see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify melting tablets or Abilify solution to take.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripiprazole injection in patients with astigmacy and behavioural disorders, which were different from schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar-I disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazole injection solution, patients should be observed in terms of extreme sedation or blood pressure loss (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Tests on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (by prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypogemia, treatment with hemostatic medicines) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia during treatment with Aripiprazesia.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polymers, polymorphism, polyphagy and weakness should be observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia patients and patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of anti-psychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was larger compared to that of Aripiprazole's sole application, in a study in which healthy volunteers Aripiprazole (15 mg dose) was used as a single-malfunction intramuscularly and that obtained at the same time Lorazepam (2 mg dosage) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blockers, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolers, compared to CYP2D6 Extensive Metabolizing, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher concentrations of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- proteaseinhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After settling the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibition the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose level before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dosage) were obtained intramuscular, the intensity of the sedation was larger compared to that of Aripiprazole's sole gift.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Aripiprazole injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 13,1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">During the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripiprazole and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazl and Placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters emerged, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Adverse events related to antipsychotic therapy, and their occurrence in the treatment of Aripiprazole, include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Aripiprazole injection solution associated with statistically significant greater improvements of aggitization / behavioural disorders compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as agitating and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms in relation to placebo and similar to the lauazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed mean improvement from baseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score for the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9,6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe disinfection, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the population population, but a statistical significance could be determined on account of a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term trials (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenia patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (orally) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 percent of respondents reported a response to the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% (oral) and haloperidol (73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measuring scales, defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study for 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole (orally) showed a significantly greater reduction in the rate of return, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Oscapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study involving schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective was' weight gain ', an increase in weight of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg) with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirroring, the companion therapy with Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazl showed a superior response to the prevention of a bipolar backfall, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazole AUC is 90% larger in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection the AUC after administration of the same dose as a tablet; the systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the average time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazole injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated administration in systemic exposure (AUC), which was 15- and 5 times higher than the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity following intravenous application, no safety-relevant concerns emerged after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum of 30 mg of human therapeutic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on the conventional studies with Aripiprazole (orally) for safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data did not identify any particular dangers for the human being.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have limited or no significance for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included dose-dependent adrenal-toxicity (lipofuscin pigmentation and / or parenchycell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase in adrenal-state-state exposure (AUC) in females at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the middle level of steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dosage in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">Moreover, a cholelithiasis was found as a result of the precipitation of sulfate-conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the Galle of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="190">In rabbits these effects were observed after dosage, which led to expositions of 3 and 11 times the middle-steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dosage.</seg>

<seg id="267">The effectiveness of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of whom about three quarters earlier had received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in the sole application or as monotherapy) was compared to a drug containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other drugs to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">Overall, 72 (31%) of 229 patients treated with Abraxane responded to treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">If only the patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the drugs in relation to the efficacy indicators such as time to worsening of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer were compared to these indicators that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in their blood before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) noted that Abraxane was more effective in patients with the first treatment to be more effective than conventional paclitaxel, and that in contrast to other paclitaxel, it must not be given with other medicines to reduce side-effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted the company Abraxis BioScience Limited a permit for the marketing of Abraxane throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients receiving first line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anthracycline-containing therapy is not indicated (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory Neuropathie degrees 3 treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached at degree 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>

<seg id="281">Abraxane is a albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of Paclitaxel, which could have significantly different pharmacological features than other wordings of Paclitaxel (see section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be removed immediately and a symptomatic treatment is initiated, and the patient must not be treated with paclitaxel again.</seg>
<seg id="283">In the case of patients no renewed Abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neutrophils number has increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte number has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver function disorders (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">Whereas abnormal cardiotoxicity was clearly not proven with Abraxane, cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with earlier anthracycline treatment or underlying cardiac or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea occur in the patients after the application of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual antiematics and contraceptive methods.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or in childbearing age who do not practice effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women of childbearing age should undergo a reliable contraception method during and up to one month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Before treatment, male patients should be advised of a sperm conserved, since the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible fertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very often) and dizziness (often) which can affect transport efficiency and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important events of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer, who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in the pivotal phase III trial.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abraxane as monotherapy in each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100); rarely (≥ 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 1000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasional: elevated blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactic hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, bloating, tongue burning, dry mouth, pain in the abdomen, pain in the abdomen, ulcers in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding, kidney and urinary tract infections:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of musculature, neck pain, muscle spasms, muscle spasms, pain in the skeletal musculature, flank pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, there are no estimates of the actual incidence and no causal connection with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-timubules ingredient that promotes the conformation of microtubules from the tubula and stabilises the microtubules by inhibiting its depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization results in an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interactions and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin imparts the transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60-albuminreceptor and due to the albumin protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two monotonously unfaded studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer in 30 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks as a 3-hour infusion with premedication to prevent an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously not received chemotherapy, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only due to metastatic disease and 19% due to metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for overall response rates and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity versus paclitaxel was evaluated by improving a grade for patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy grade 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for decaying baseline based on the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">Pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions by Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active substance exposition (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multi-phase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume amounted to 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume points to a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or tissue binding of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with patients with advanced solid tumors, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to an intravenous 30 minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with the values following a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The settlement of paclitaxel was higher (43%) following the Abraxane application (43%) than after a solvent-containing paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers it is reported that paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-droxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, the mean value for cumulative discharge of the unchanged active substance was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renal clearing.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available for patients over 75 years of age, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light light protected over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarcinogenic drug and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be treated with caution when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile syringe, slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0,9%) sodium chloride infusion solution is injected into a Abraxane breakthrough bottle.</seg>
<seg id="327">After complete encore of the solution, the bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wetting of the solid.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the bottle should be swiveled and / or inverted gently for at least 2 minutes until a complete resusboard of the powder occurs.</seg>
<seg id="329">If precipitations or sinks are visible, the water-through bottle must be inverted gently to achieve a complete resuspension before the application.</seg>
<seg id="330">The exact total dose volume of the 5 mg / ml suspension is calculated for the patient and the corresponding quantity of the reconstituted Abraxane is injected into an empty, sterile PVC or non-PVC infusion bag.</seg>

<seg id="358">• Training leaflet • Summary of the characteristics of the drug (specialist information), labelling and packaging examples. • With unique pictorial presentation of the correct use of the product, cooling boxes for transport through the patients.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicine already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same substance (also called "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood-haematuses in which there may be complications in connection with blood transfusion, if an endogenous blood donation is not possible before the intervention, and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be made by the patient or his supervisor, provided that they have received appropriate instructions.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobin values should always lie in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists, and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by erythropoietinal deficiency, or that the body does not respond adequately to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell into which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which it empowers to the formation of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">When administered as an injection into a vein, Abseamed was compared to a primary study of 479 patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems, compared to the reference drug.</seg>
<seg id="370">All participating patients had been injected for at least eight weeks of Eprex / Erypo into a vein before they were either converted to abyamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in haemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of abyamed under the skin were investigated with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems, the haemoglobin values of patients who were killed on abyamed were maintained in the same measure as those who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, punging migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed should not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not cause allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed according to the European Union regulations, evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that manufactures Abseamed will provide information packages for healthcare professionals across all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted Medice pharmaceuticals Pütter GmbH & Co KG a approval for the placing of abyamed in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion needs in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma that receive chemotherapy, and in which the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the onset of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8,1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency) if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, for planned larger surgical procedures that require a large volume of blood (4 or more units blood in women; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For the reduction of foreign blood, Abseamed can be used before a large elective orthopaedic surgery in adults without iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected loss of blood from 900-1800 ml, which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The haemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients where the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; it is therefore necessary to assess the individual clinical course and condition of disease by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can be observed on or below the haemoglobin target concentration in one patient.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this haemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be used to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa dosage must be reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest permitted dose required to control anaemia and anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial anaemia is less pronounced (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial anaemia is less pronounced (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week via intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; it is therefore necessary to assess the individual clinical course and condition of disease by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this haemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be used to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest permitted dose required to control anaemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment the haemoglobin value is increased by at least 1 g / dl (0,62 mmol / l) or the response rate number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl over the initial value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the reticulozyte number &lt; 40,000 cells / µl have increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the hemoglobin value is ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticulozyte number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the response rate number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood vessels is required, should be obtained twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure at a dose of 600 I.E. / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should begin as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the autologous blood donation program began, so that large iron reserves are available before the beginning of the abseamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.E. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.E. / kg each on 10 consecutive days, on the day of the intervention and 4 days immediately thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection at the end of dialysis can be given over the hose of a fistula needle followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure adequate injection of the drug in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients undergoing treatment with some erythropoetin in erythroblastoma (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive an Abseamed or other erythropoetin (see Section 4.4 - erythroblastoopia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (e.g. venous thromboembolilies).</seg>
<seg id="409">The application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients with a larger elective orthopaedic surgery: severe coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial occlusion, vascular disease of the carotid or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with a recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular accident.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastoopia (PRCA) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of action, defined as reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the etiquette value should be determined and the usual causes of non-response (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium oxide, infections or inflammations, blood loss and hemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the hypocyte value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the catulocyte "index"), is reduced (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 0.5%), the thrombocytes and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other cause of an active loss is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and a study of the bone marrow to diagnose a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of abseamed in patients with a risk of an antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency in maintenance therapy, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoic-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit attributed to the administration of epoetidine if the hemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required for controlling the symptoms and preventing blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestive failure, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to these findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which is not yet dialytic, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In tumour patients receiving chemotherapy, a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin alfa and erythropoietin response should be taken into account for the evaluation of epoetin alfa therapy efficiency (patients who may need to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8,1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2, in order to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2) treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk weighing while taking part in the patient, which should also consider the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">If possible, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated appropriately if possible before the beginning of the epoetin-alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing large elective orthopaedic surgery should receive appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an output hemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of post-operative thrombotic / vascular events may exist.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetin was not shown to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy, a haemoglobin target concentration of 12-14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporine dose should be adapted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro examinations on tumor tissues there is no indication of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF in relation to hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, cerebral thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, reinalthromboses, and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under Erythropoetin treatment, as well as patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most frequent side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or worsening an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascultic events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients under the treatment of erythropoetine.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment, it is possible to treat patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetic alfa-based epoetin alfa is glycosilized and is identical with the amino acids and the carbohydrate content with the endogenous human erythropoetin, which was isolated from the urine of local patients.</seg>
<seg id="435">It could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa specifically stimulates erythropoesis and does not affect leukopoesis.</seg>

<seg id="544">200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dye (hemoglobin) and adjust your severity dose accordingly to keep the risk of a thrombosis (thrombotic event) as low as possible.</seg>
<seg id="545">This risk should be carefully weighed against the benefits derived from treatment with epoetin alfa, especially if you have an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, e.g. if you are obese (e.g. a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).</seg>
<seg id="546">If you are cancer patient, bear in mind that Abseamed can act as a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances affect the tumor negatively.</seg>
<seg id="547">If you have an orthopaedic surgery, the cause of your anaemia should be examined and treated appropriately before the start of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="548">If your values of the red blood dye (hemoglobin) are too high, you should not receive Abseamed, as there is an increased risk of post-grafting after surgery.</seg>

<seg id="552">Depending on how your blood pressure (anemia) appeals to the treatment, the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control.</seg>
<seg id="553">Your doctor will need regular blood tests to check the success of your treatment and ensure that the medicine acts properly and your haemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value.</seg>
<seg id="554">Once you are well set, you receive regular doses of Abseamed between 25 and 50 I.U. / kg twice a week, spread over two equally large injections.</seg>
<seg id="555">Your doctor will need regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your haemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value.</seg>
<seg id="556">Depending on how the anaemia refers to the treatment, the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control.</seg>
<seg id="557">To ensure that the haemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value, the treating doctor will carry out regular blood tests.</seg>
<seg id="558">If it is necessary to shorten the treatment time before the surgery, a dose of 300 I.U. / kg may be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery, on the day of operation and another 4 days after the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="559">However, if your doctor considers this to be appropriate, you can also learn how to squirt yourself under the skin.</seg>
<seg id="560">Heart, heart attacks, brain bleeding, stroke, transient circulatory disorders of the brain, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, vascular ablation (aneurysm), thrombosis of the retina and blood clots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under erythropoetin treatment.</seg>
<seg id="561">Eye lids and lips (quinck edema) and shock-like allergic reactions with symptoms such as tingling, redness, itching, hot feeling and accelerated pulse have been reported in rare cases.</seg>
<seg id="562">Erythroblastoma means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone marrow (see section "Specific caution when applying abseamed is required ').</seg>
<seg id="563">After repeated blood donations, it can occur - regardless of the treatment with abseamed - to a blood pfone formation (thrombotic vascular events).</seg>
<seg id="564">Treatment with abseamed can be accompanied by an increased risk of blood progravation after surgery (post-operative thrombotic vascular events) if your output hemoglobin value is too high</seg>

<seg id="567">Aclasta is used to treat the following diseases: • Osteoporosis (a disease that makes the bones brittle) both in women after menopause and men.</seg>
<seg id="568">It is used in patients with a high fracture risk (fractures), including patients who have recently suffered a minor traumatic hip fracture; • Morbus Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">Additionally, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment; before the first infusion, patients with hip fracture should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125 000 IE) orally or by injection into a muscle.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of acetamol or ibuprofen (means of inflammation) shortly after the application of acetamol can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after infusion, such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headaches.</seg>
<seg id="571">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Acupa must be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in treating this disease.</seg>
<seg id="572">Since the active ingredient in Acupa is the same as in Zometa, a part of the data material for zometa was used to evaluate aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="573">The first study included almost 8 000 elderly women with osteoporosis, and the number of spine and hip fractures was examined over a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years, who recently had a hip fracture; it was examined the number of fractures over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">In the case of Morbus Paget aclasta was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and compared with Risedron (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of efficacy was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in the serum (an enzyme that breaks down bone substance) in the blood back normalized or decreased at least 75% compared with the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients under aclasta (without any other osteoporosis medicine) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to the patients under the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">Compared to all patients under aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis therapies) with those under placebo the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fracture, 9% of patients under aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of the side effects of Acupa occur within the first three days after the infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledron acid or other bisphosphonates or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion and osteonecrosis (dying of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of aclasta provides information for physicians who prescribe aclasta to treat osteoporosis, which contains information on how to use the medicine, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="586">Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and include the following core messages: • The package insert • Contrast-indication in pregnancy and in nursing women • Required of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Major signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When taking care of medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, intravenous 5 mg aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the dosage of aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Acupa should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the disease Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After the treatment of the disease Paget with Acupa, a long remission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly recommended that in patients with Morbus Paget adequate intake of calcium, corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elemental calcium, for at least 10 days after the application of aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of orally or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first aclasta fusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acetamol can be reduced shortly after the application of acetamol or ibuprofen after the application of acetamol.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorder (see section 4.4) For patients with a creatinine clearance (&lt; 35 ml / min), aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger ones.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents of Acupa are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, as data is lacking for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experiences exist for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalemia should be treated with aclasta prior to therapy with sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Because of the rapid insertion of the effect of citric acid to bone reconstruction, temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia may develop, the maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the infusion of aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly recommended that in patients with Morbus Paget sufficient supply of calcium, corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elemental calcium, to ensure at least 10 days after the application of aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene should be considered before using bisphosphonates a dental examination with appropriate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who require dental intervention, no data is available whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acetamol can be reduced shortly after the application of acetamol or ibuprofen after the application of acetamol (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The frequency of suspected cases of atrial fibrillation was increased in patients receiving aclasta (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1.000) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney function disorder was associated with renal dysfunctions associated with kidney function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinine) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The alteration of the creatine-clearing (measured annually before the administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as impaired renal function were comparable in a clinical study of osteoporosis over three years comparable to the acetate and placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatine within 10 days of application was observed in 1.8% of patients treated with acetone compared to 0.8% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium levels (less than 2,10 mmol / l) were observed in 2.3% of patients treated with aclasta in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with aclasta in the disease Paget study.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received supplemental sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study to avoid clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recently received hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Acupa (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions After the administration of zoledron acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the infusion center, such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonekrosis in the jaw area was reported, especially in cancer patients, about osteonekrosen (primary in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledroneic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 Investigations with 7,736 patients showed osteoarthritis in the jaw area for one with acetone and in a patient treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In case of an overdose which leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a balance can be achieved by adding oral calcium and / or intravenous calcium gluconate intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been demonstrated in postmenopausal women (7,736 women aged 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density (BMD) T score for the Schenkelhal ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on the morphometric spinal fractures Acupa lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or several new vertebral fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60% reduced risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on acetate fractures showed a lasting effect over three years, which resulted in a reduced risk of hip fractures in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) aclasta significantly increased bone density on lumbar vertebrae, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the entire hip by 6.0%, the lower spine by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology: 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the basin.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer-tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume and the preservation of the trabecular bone architecture compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal Propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and beta-C telescopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Acupa reduced BSAP significantly by 30% in comparison to the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 28% below the output value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the output value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the output value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.E. orally or intramuscular) 2 weeks prior to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Overall mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with acetone compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, the aclasta treatment in comparison to placebo treatment increased BMD at the total and lower levels at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">For 24 months, aclasta treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% on the overall level and 4.3% on the lower abdomen than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures was 7.5% in aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once yearly administration of acetone in comparison with the once-weekly administration of alendronate was not inferior to the percentage change in lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the disease in the disease Paget of the bone Acupa was studied in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, particularly mild to moderately severe disease Paget of the bone (mean serum mirror of alkaline phosphatase corresponding to 2.6 times up to 3 times the age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of Zoledron juice in comparison to the intake of 30 mg risedronate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the baseline for aclasta and Risedron.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as a Responder at the end of the six-month main study could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">The 143 with acetonias and 107 patients treated with Risedronat were able to maintain therapeutic response in 141 patients treated with aclasta compared to 71 of patients treated with Risedron in an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-off and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg Zoledron juice in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dossically independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma levels rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the highest value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long-lasting phase of very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the highest value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large circulation system with half-life time t ½ a 0,24 and t ½ β 1.87 hours followed by a prolonged period of elimination with a terminal elimination time t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early stages of distribution (α and β, with the above mentioned ½ -values) presumably represent rapid resorption into the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose can be found in the urine, while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The overall Clearance amounts to 5,04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the tin-acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface below the curve (plasma concentration at time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearing of metabolized substances by cytochrom-P450 enzymes is unlikely, because zoledron juice is not metabolized by humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolism-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Coledron Acid correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinin Clearance, and was in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function disorder up to a creatine-clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adjustment of the zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because there is limited data for severe kidney dysfunction (creatinin- feel &lt; 30 ml / min), no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-letally acting intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and 0.6 mg / kg body weight in rats.</seg>
<seg id="657">In dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC, 6 times the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous use, the renal tolerability of zoledron acid was administered in rats using doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, administered in intervals of 2-3 weeks (a cumulative dose equivalent to 7times the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC, equivalent).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated exposure to cumulated expositions that sufficiently exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects were observed in other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, as well as on the intravenous injection site.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent follow-up in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphysis of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, an infestation that reflects the pharmacological, antiresorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed a teratogenicity in dosages of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner (visceral) deformities and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">In rabbits no teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledroneic acid is a representative of a substance called bisphosphonate and is used for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the disease Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Declining blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens formed of androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the case of the Morbus Paget, bone reconstruction takes place too fast, and new bone material is constructed unstructured, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalizing the bone structure, thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus gives the bone strength again.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in dental treatment or undergoing dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">When using aclasta with other medicines please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you are taking other drugs / applying / applying them recently, even if they are not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="677">It is especially important for your doctor to know if you use drugs known to damage the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="678">When using aclasta together with food and beverages, you are worried that according to your doctor's instructions, you should take plenty of fluids before and after treatment with Acupa.</seg>
<seg id="679">The usual dose is 5 mg once a year, administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as infusion in a vein.</seg>
<seg id="680">If you recently broke the hip, it is recommended to make the administration of acetamina two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="681">The usual dose is 5 mg administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as infusion in a vein.</seg>
<seg id="682">Since Acupa works for a long time, you may need another dose only after a year or longer.</seg>
<seg id="683">It is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after infusion.</seg>
<seg id="684">At Morbus Paget, Acupa can work for more than a year, and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="685">If the administration of Acupa is missed, contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment.</seg>
<seg id="686">Before ending the treatment with Acupa If you are considering termination of treatment with Acupa, please consult your next doctor's appointment and discuss this with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="687">Side effects associated with the first infusion perform very frequently (with more than 30% of patients), however, following the subsequent infusions, however, less frequently.</seg>
<seg id="688">Fever and chills, muscle or joint pain and headaches occur within the first three days after the administration of Acupa.</seg>
<seg id="689">Currently it is unclear whether Acupa causes this irregular heartbeat, but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you received aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="690">Physical signs due to a too low calcium concentration in the blood, such as muscle cramps or tingling or deaf feeling, especially around the mouth.</seg>

<seg id="692">Persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in mouth or jaw were reported above all in patients treated with bisphosphonates due to other diseases.</seg>
<seg id="693">About allergic reactions, including rare cases of breathing problems, hives and angioedema (such as swelling in the face, tongue or throat), has been reported.</seg>
<seg id="694">Please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects significantly affect you or notice side effects that are not listed in this use information.</seg>

<seg id="696">In patients with a recently received low-traumatic hip fracture it is recommended to perform infusion of acetamina two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="697">Before and after the administration of acetone, patients must be adequately supplied with liquid; this is particularly important for patients receiving diuretic therapy.</seg>
<seg id="698">Because of the rapid insertion of the effect of citric acid to bone reconstruction, temporary, sometimes symptomatically running, hypokalzemia may develop, the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the infusion of aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="699">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Morbus Paget, equivalent to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the application of acetonia.</seg>
<seg id="700">In patients with a recently received low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of orally or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the infusion of acetamina.</seg>

<seg id="749">Abstract of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Employment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has judged the trials carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes medication) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) that cannot be satisfactorily adjusted with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonylic or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonylic resin or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the account treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should reduce the dose of the sulfonylic acid or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sinks, so type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients, the efficacy of acetylene in TripleTherapy has been evaluated; the patients received a combination of metformin containing a sulfonylic resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of an additional injection of acetate for existing treatment with metformin and sulfonylic acid showed a decrease in HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional injection of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study investigating the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, patients who received Actos in addition to insulin had a decrease in HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were vision disturbances, upper respiratory infections (colds), weight gain and hypoesthesia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos should not be used in patients who may react hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high level of ketone levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with Metformin in patients during single use, where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a permit for the marketing of Actos in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, convex and carry on one side the markings "15" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and is unsuitable for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, therefore the use in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">For patients who are at risk of developing at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease has been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports of heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output hepatic cells (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme levels are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision, whether the treatment of the patient with Pioglitazone continues, should be guided by the clinical evaluation to the screening of the laboratory parameters.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been detected, which can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemodilution, a slight reduction of the mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and haematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under the therapy with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and haematocrits by 3.1-4.1%) and reduced haemoglobin by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, Pioglitazone is available as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sulfonylic substance or as a double combination therapy with insulin, the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the launch, the treatment with Thiazolid india, including pioglitazone, was reported by an occurrence or worsening of a diabetic macular edema with a decrease in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but promising doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report about disorders of visual acuity; appropriate ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of reports of adverse events concerning bone fractures in randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is deprecated (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies of the interactions have shown that Pioglitazone has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC by Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC from pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that, under treatment with Pioglitazone, the hyperinsuline and increased insulin resistance of the mother's animal are reduced and thus the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very often &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 1000; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (not estimated from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and refractive index of the lens as observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone ALT-Anstitis performed more frequently than in placebo over three times the upper limit of the standard range, but less frequently than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylic.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe heart failure under pioglitazone was 1.6% higher compared to placebo when Pioglitazone bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since its launch, it has rarely been reported about congestive heart failure under Pioglitazone, however, when Pioglitazone has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of reports of adverse events with regard to bone fractures in randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with pioglitazone and over 7,400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study extending over a period of 3.5 years, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to have an activation of specific core receptors (Peroxicome proliferation activated Receptor-γ) (PPAR-γ)), which results in an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be demonstrated that Pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in case of an insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Gliclazid as monotherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the start of the therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclogicide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study for 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient with insulin in spite of three months optimization period were randomized to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c decreased by 0.45% compared to those receiving only insulin; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies over one year, Pioglitazone showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinine quotients compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was examined in a small study of type 2 diabetics in a small study of 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels and slightly, but clinically insignificant elevated LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced total plasma glycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or glicloids and increased HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazone, while lower values were observed under metformin and gliclacide.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks Pioglitazone not only reduced the intimidity triglyceride, but also improved the postprandial elevated triglyceride level, both about an effect on triglyceride absorption and hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomised to receive either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is quickly absorbed, with peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in the plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to efficacy in roughly three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimally pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazone has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentrations of Pioglitazone (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the rotting (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma eliminator time of unchanged Pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans and the total active metabolite is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of the oral clearing of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxikological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that, under treatment with Pioglitazone, the hyperinsuline and increased insulin resistance of the mother's animal are reduced and thus the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) were induced in the rat.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other thiazolid india resulted in an increased incidence of colon tumours.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the mark "30" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study for two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were studied with pioglitazone or bililacide.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies over one year, Pioglitazone showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinine quotients compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks Pioglitazone not only reduced the intimidity triglyceride, but also improved the postprandial elevated triglyceride level, both about an effect on the triglyceride absorption and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing the target of its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary revascularisation and revascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that no cardiovascular long-term risks are associated with taking Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the markings "45" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of reports of adverse events concerning bone fractures in randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients receiving pioglitazone and of over 7,400 patients receiving comparative medication, there was an increased incidence of fractures in women.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane has been studied in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, where the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to effectively use insulin.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror suggesting that blood sugar levels were similar to that of another human insulin.</seg>

<seg id="868">In addition, doses of acetabulae may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (the complete list is to be found in the package insert).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of actraphane were outweighed in the treatment of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted Novo Nordisk A / S a permit for the marketing of Actraphane in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Premixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily when a rapid initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">For example, patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly by a more intensive insulin therapy may change the hypoglycemia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in terms of starch, brand (manufacturer), type of insulin (fast acting, biphasic, long acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or production method (by recombinant DNA as compared to insulin of animal origin) can cause a change in dosage.</seg>

<seg id="1222">The data obtained from the open extension study in phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the serum acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of rheumatics, so that less than 3% of patients needed treatment against a gout in the months of 16-24 (i.e. more than 97% of patients needed no treatment).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the gout, which resulted in a complete disappearance of the studs up to 24 months in 54% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients receiving a long-term treatment with febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients receiving allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long-term extension studies (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and the surface under the plasma concentrations time curve (AUC) of febuxostat after administration were simpler and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose-proportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For dosages between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in the AUC is observed for febuxostat, which is larger than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the Cmax amounts to about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>

<seg id="1232">After taking an 80 mg dose of 14C-marched febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was found in the urine as unchanged Febuxostat (3%), the known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%) as well as other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion over the urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the chair was found as unaltered febuxostat (12%), acetylene oxide of the active substance (1%), its well-known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%) as well as other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">Special patient groups of renal insufficiency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe kidney failure, the Cmax of Febuxostat did not change in proportion to subjects with normal kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The mean total AUC of Febuxostat increased about 1.8 times from 7.5 μg in the group with normal renal function to 13.2 μ / ml in the group with severe kidney function.</seg>

<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the esophagus, the patient must not lie down until the first intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since Alendronat and vitamin D3 are already used separately from each other in medicines approved in the European Union, the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to demonstrate the efficacy of ADROVANCE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than those who only received alendronate (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data suggesting that the alendronate dose contained in ADROVANCE corresponds to the dose required to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, musculoskeletal pain (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain, dyspepsia (diarrhea), ulcers (ulcera) of the esophagus, dyspaggia (swallowing), inflamed abdomen (blower abdomen) and acid falling.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) against Alendronate, vitamin D3, or any of the other ingredients, ADROVANCE may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It must not be applied in case of diseases of the esophagus, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1288">Follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and associated side effects (see Section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• The patients should not chew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth, as there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulceration. • Patients should not lie before the first intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1290">E.g. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleedings or surgical procedures in the upper Gastrointestinal tract except Pyloroplasty, can be given only under special caution (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal responses, such as oesophagitis, entophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal strokes, were reported in patients under the seizure of alendronate (partially they were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore attentively pay attention to all signs and symptoms pointing to possible esophageal reactions, and patients should be advised to stop the drug in case of symptoms of ophageal irritation such as dyspaggia, pain in swallowing or retrograde pain or new or deteriorating heartburn (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe esophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or continue to take it after the occurrence of symptoms pointing to a malignant irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">Whereas in large-scale clinical studies with alendronate no increased risk was detected, the stomach and duodenal ulcera, among them some severe and with complications, were reported (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteodeficiency of the jaw, usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection (including osteomyelitis), has been reported in cancer patients whose treatment regimen predominantly intravenously administered bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available which indicate whether the removal of bisphosphonate therapy in patients who require a surgical procedure decreases the risk of osteoarthritis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">The clinical assessment by the treating physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed to take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of ADROVANCE after having noticed their failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets the same day, but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases that affect the metabolism of minerals (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be adequately treated before the therapy with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines may affect the resorption of alendronate when taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Patients must therefore wait at least 30 minutes after taking Alendronat before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not conducted, alendronate was taken in clinical trials with a large number of commonly prescribed medicines without having clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended only for postmenopausal women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or lactating women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteodeficiency of the jaw was reported in patients with bisphosphonates; most reports date from cancer patients, but also reported in osteoporosis.</seg>

<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplant was repelled after a period of treatment (for example, by examining how often a renewed organ transplant or a re-recording of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, further studies on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation were carried out and examined how Advance is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including immunosuppression or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and daily dose; changes in the formulation or regime should only be performed under close-meshed control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a change to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advantf should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of repulsion and tolerability in individual cases and on blood reflection provisions (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advantf, the tacrolimus valley mirrors should be checked before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure, measured as valley level, was comparable with both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of the tacrolimus valley level are recommended during the first two weeks after transplant under Advance in order to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate aftermarket phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">As tacrolimus is a low clearance substance, an adaptation of the anagraph can take several days before the Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of application To suppress transplant rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, the maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advance therapy should begin at 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as once daily donation in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dosage adjustment can be necessary later, as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change in the course of the patient's stabilization after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advance therapy should begin at 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily donation in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from prograf to Advantf Must a transplant recipient of twice daily dosage of prograf capsules can be converted to a once daily intake of Advo.f, this conversion has to take place in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Renal and liver transplantation After switching from other immunosuppressiva to Advantf once a day, treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplants must begin for prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplantation For adult patients who are converted to adecagraf, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Although there is no clinical experience with Advo.f in lung, pancreatic and colorectal transplanted patients, patients with an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day were used in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood tal mirroring in the aspired region, a reduction of the dose may be necessary in patients with severe liver dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of the kidney function (including a regular determination of the serum creatinin levels, a calculation of the urine leakage and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Caution is recommended (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5) when switching from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the valley level in full blood The dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of repulsion and tolerability in individual cases with the help of whole blood tacrolimus-talkmirror-controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to conduct frequent checks of the tacrolimus valley level during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-bottom levels of tacrolimus should also be controlled by prograf, dose adjustment, immunosuppressive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could change the full blood circulation of the Tacrolimus (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advance is a medicine with a low clearance, adjustments of the dose may require several days before the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the level of blood in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the Talmirrors of tacrolimus in full blood are usually in the area of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects, which may occur as a result of tacrolimus lower or over-exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes in the formulation or regime should only be performed under close-meshed control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which have proven to be resistant to other immunosuppressants, there are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation advant.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and graft recipients in children, there are still no clinical data for the retarated formulation advant.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions which may result in decomposition of the tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other plant remedies during treatment with Advantf (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is offered as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable variations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, prograf was seen as a cardiomyopathy that could be observed as aqueous humor or septum hypertrophie, which can therefore also occur under Advantf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunction, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin lesions by appropriate clothing or use of a sun protective agent with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who are taking Tacrolimus, symptoms for PRES such as headaches, altered states of consciousness, convulsions and vision disturbances, should be a radiological investigation (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since Advantf contains hard capsules, retarded, lactose, special care is required for patients with rare hereditary galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and thus increase or decrease the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the tacrolimus blood levels with simultaneous administration of substances which can change the CYP3A metabolic rate and adjust the tacrolimus dosage accordingly (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive interaction has been associated with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole as well as with the Macromedia antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the rise in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Tacrolimus's effect on the metabolism of other medicines tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 Hemmer; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus can be metabolized with medicines which are metabolized by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As tacrolimus can reduce the Clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase hormone exposure, decisions on contraceptive actions should be particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus potentially decreases the clearances of pentobarbital and phenazone, and can prolong their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a low number of examinations on transplant patients do not suggest that, compared to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, a monitoring of the newborn is recommended for possible harmful effects of tacrolimus (especially regarding its effect on the kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1467">It was reported about benign or malignant neoplasties including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumours in combination with tacrolimus treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, low water solubility and high binding to erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it is assumed that tacrolimus is not dialyable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mode of action and pharmacocotic effects On a molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus can be mediated by binding to a cytosolitic protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cell interior.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a certain series of lymphocykin genes.</seg>

<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral prograf in these published studies corresponded to observations in the large studies where prograf was used for liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients for primary immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted multi-center study with oral prograf, more than 110 patients received either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin as part of a 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome, was less common in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In patients treated with tacrolimus, in 21.7% of the cases for the formation of a bronchiolitis obliterans compared to 38.0% below Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where ciclosporin had to be switched to tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients enforced by Tacrolimus on Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no graft rejection was after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in lung transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus Group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the frequency of the emergence of a bronchiolitis obliterative syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreatic transplantation A multicentre study with oral prograf was performed on 205 patients who simultaneously underwent a pancreatic and kidney transplant based on a randomized method of tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (per protocol) of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to reach the desired valley level from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral prograf as primary immunosuppressant after intestinal transplantation demonstrated an updated survival rate of 75% in 155 patients (65 only intestines, 75 liver and intestines and 25 multivisal transplantation) under Tacrolimus and Prednisone, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound faction of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher levels of clearance observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby excretion occurs mainly via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advocation was approximately 10% lower in cases of stable patients (once daily) in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg) in relation to the total daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the deficiency of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Advate is used for the treatment of bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Haemophilia A patients suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but produced according to a method called recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell into which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which it empowers to the formation of the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, but it is made differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of Advate in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood-type episodes was "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of factor VIII deficiency, according to the location and extent of bleeding and clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period should not fall under the indicated plasma levels (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection all 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment, adequate determination of factor VIII-plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in response to VIII, different in vivo recovery and exhibit different half-life times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII-plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled at an appropriate dose, a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII-therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded after finding the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against Factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always directed against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml of plasma by modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to Factor VIII, whereby the risk is greatest within the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnestic known inhibitor development, after conversion from a recombinant Factor VIII product to another, the recurrence of (low-positive) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences concerning the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs, which occurred in the largest number of patients, were inhibitors of factor VIII (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients with a higher risk of formation of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very frequently (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), rarely (≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), very rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of individual patients (234). the unexpected drop in the blood coagulation factor VIII-Spiegels occurred postoperatively (10th - 14th postoperative day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE fusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">The blood clotting was maintained throughout the period and both the Factor VIII- Mirrors in the Plasma as well as the Clearance Rate showed sufficient values on the 15th post operative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical studies with ADVATE to 145 children and adults 2 diagnosed with severe hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to Factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days), only one patient after 26 expositions with ADVATE showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) were found in a FVIII inhibitor following previous exposure to Factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">Previously untreated patients showed 5 out of 25 (20%) with ADVATE treated patients with inhibitors against Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The patient's immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analysed by investigating the antibodies against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of antibody-level anti-CHO cell proteins, but otherwise no signs or symptoms occurred which indicate an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the incidence of urticaria, pruritus, skin rash and increased number of eosinophiles granuloyte were reported in several repeated product expositions as part of the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP has continued to assess the benefit-risk weighing as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which necessitates filing of PSURs every 6 months, and decided to apply for further extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited officially granted the CHMP Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) to withdraw his application for the marketing of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the chest, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissue that binds and supports other structures in the body) is affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus genetically altered that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is an adenovirus, which has been modified so that it cannot produce copies of itself and can therefore not trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced by the non-defect p53 gene in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In the case of Li-Fraumeni cancer, in which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not function properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient who joined Li-Fraumeni cancer in the lower abdomen area, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had examined the company's answers to the questions he asked, there were still some questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the submitted documents, the CHMP generates a list of questions that will be sent to the company on day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore brings benefits to the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration as well as the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company has not adequately demonstrated that Advexin can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people coming in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not know the CHMP about whether the withdrawal had consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "modified substances release" "" "means that the tablets are put together in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, nasal infections caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosa swelling (nasal nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents aged 12 and older, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is a tablet twice a day, which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are cleared.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the drug can be relieved on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main factors were the changes in the severity of the hayfever symptoms reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scala how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In the case of all hay fever symptoms, apart from the constipation of the nose, the patients who received aerosaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared with 35.9% in the patients who received pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients under aaaze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients receiving desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart hunt), dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, Pseudoephedrine or any of the other components, against adrenergic agents or lauatadin (another drug for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerosaze should not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hyperthyrophal hypertension), or even an hemorrhagic stroke (stroke) or a risk of an hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued an approval to the SP Europe company for the marketing of Aerinaze in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it can be swallowed whole (i.e. without biting, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy (see section 5.1), Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have gone down.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days since the activity of pseudoephedrine decreases over time in long-term applications.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued as mono therapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As Aerinaze contains Pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor respectively within 2 weeks after the end of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This can be attributed to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergoid, thihydroergotamine or other deongestiva, which can be performed perennially or nasally as abnormalities (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymorazoline, Naphasholin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been examined for this group of patients and the data will not suffice to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aaaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is insufficient to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment must be stopped in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or headaches).</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of the following patient groups, caution is advised: • Patients with cardiac arrhythmia • patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck obstruction or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, since antihistamines can otherwise prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical trials involving desloratadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were given, no clinically relevant interactions were observed or changes in the plasma concentrations of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with either desloratadin and placebo, regardless of whether or not they were taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of loratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">In vitro studies have shown that CYP2D6 does not inhibit CYP2D6 and is neither a medium nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerosols during pregnancy is not assured, but experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies did not increase the frequency of abnormalities in comparison to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerosols should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to a dizziness that can lead to impairment of traffic or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lethal deformation.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, aggravated mition, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupillary starre and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibition of the expression of the adhesive molecule P selectivity on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desquatadin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement values of flight performance including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, no increased incidence of drowsiness compared to placebo was detected at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage may evoke other sympathetic effects such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients between the ages of 12 and 78 took part in seasonal allergic rhinitis, receiving 414 patients Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets, determined by the overall score for the symptoms (except the nasal mucosa swelling), was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect determined by the nasal mucosa was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets did not show significant differences regarding gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study for pharmacokinetics by Aerinaze, Desquatadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the perimal application of Aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the body weight of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multiple dose study, which was conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, four subjects of desloratadin were poorly metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine was bioequivalent to exposure to an aerosaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional safety pharmacology studies, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with loratadin do not identify any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient Pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and the Pharmacovigilance System described in Module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to alleviating the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets alleviate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) such as sneezing, running or itchy nose and tears or itchy eyes while constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if you are diagnosed or diagnosed with the following symptoms or diseases under the use of Aerinaze: • High blood pressure • heartbeat, palpitations • nausea and headaches or a strengthening of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">If you take aaaze with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Transport resistance and the operation of machines When used in the recommended dosage, it is not to be expected that Aerinaze will lead to dizziness or reduce the attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of Aerinaze than you should inform immediately your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken a larger amount of aerosaze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you forgot to take Aerinaze if you forgot to take a dose in time, take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the indicated side effects significantly affects you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Heart hunting, restlessness with increased physical activity, dry mouth, dizziness, sore throat, loss of appetite, constipation, sugar in urine, increased blood sugar levels, thirst, fatigue, headaches, insomnia, nervousness, and dizziness.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the launch of Descent atadin, very rare cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives, swelling) or skin rashes have been reported.</seg>
<seg id="1718">About cases of palpitations, heart chasing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, insomnia with increased physical activity, over cases of liver inflammation and about cases of conspicuous liver values was also reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as 5 mg tablets, 5 mg lyophilisate for intake (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg and 5 mg of processed tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once daily, which in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius studied in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies on patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Effectiveness has been measured by investigating the symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadripaddles, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution to insert and the melting trays in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores (symptom scores) by 25 to 32%, compared with the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies in Urticaria, the symptom scores were reduced after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared with 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, lauatadin or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued an approval to the company SP Europe for the placing of Aerius in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience in clinical studies of efficacy in the application of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous disease process and may be terminated after the symptoms have been disrupted and resumed again.</seg>
<seg id="1732">The persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions haven't been found in clinical studies involving desloratadin tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered additionally (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to dizziness, which can lead to impairment of traffic or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more frequently than in placebo were tiredness (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headaches, this occurred with 5.9% of the patients treated with desloratadin and in 6.9% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multidisciplinary study, administered up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times clinical dosage).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibition of the expression of the adhesion gene P selectivity to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">There was no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect as part of a clinical study with multiple doses given to desloratadin in a dose of up to 20 mg. a day for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (nine times the clinical dose) over ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval proved.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desquatadin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement values of flight performance including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the total live scores of the questionnaire on the quality of life of Rhino conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively decreases the stress caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was substituted for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, irrespective of the etiology of the different forms, is similar and chronic patients can be recruited as prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamine release is a causative factor in all urticarial diseases, it is expected that in other forms of urticaria, desloratadin will also lead to an improvement in symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and lowering the size and number of quadripaddles at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistaminika in chronically idiopathic urticaria, the patients who did not respond to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in the stimulus rate by more than 50% was observed in 55% of the treated patients compared to 19% of those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius greatly reduced the disorder of sleep and wakefulness as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study in which the patient biographies were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulation after daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of loratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1758">In vivo, desloratadin inhibit CYP2D6 and in vitro studies have shown that the CYP2D6 drug is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that there are no data available to support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, anamnesis, physical examination and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influenza caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus which could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Flu pandemic occurs when a new strain of the flu virus appears, which can spread easily from humans to humans, because humans have not yet built an immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "following the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts contained in the vaccine as" "" "foreign" "" "and forms antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to form antibodies more quickly in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which recognizes the human body as a foreign body) was purified, purified and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, Agenerase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">However, the damage to the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases related to AIDS can delay AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was investigated in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This medicine, which was increased with low dose, was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used protease inhibitors earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the alteration of the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies involving patients who had previously not taken a protease inhibitor, after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced viral load, but only very few of the children who had been treated with protease inhibitors were very few.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study involving adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the medicine amassing increased with Ritonavir after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenerase combined with Ritonavir increased the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients receiving their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common adverse events of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may not be used in patients who take St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines, which are also degraded as amases and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other remedies against HIV, the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (dying of bone tissue) or an immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children treated with protease inhibitors over four years were outweighed against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee found that the benefit of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously not taken a protease inhibitor is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "because at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information is available." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited a permit for the placing of Agenerase in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, proteasinhibitors (PI) -previously treated adults and children from 4 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenerase capsules should be administered to pharmacokinetic booy of amprenavir along with low doses of Ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amponavir should be carried out taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and patient pretreatment (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Ambroavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than the capsule of Amprenavir; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution are not replaceable on a milligram per milligram (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg. amponavir twice daily with 100 mg knight avir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral remedies.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the reinforcing addition of kritonavir (boosting), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of Amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of amprenor which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of kritonavir or other protease inhibitors have not been studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under the age of 4, because of the lack of data for harmlessness and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be treated with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and can also represent the mediums of the cytochrome P450 Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used as a result of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of amprenavir during the intake of amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including antibiotic treatment, does not prevent the risk of HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Generally, Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of kritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral remedies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">In case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with an existing hepatic function including chronic-active hepatitis also show an increased incidence of liver dysfunction under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with Fluticasone or other glucocorticoids, which are metabolized via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Morbus Cushing and the suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the drug change of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, simultaneous administration of admixture with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some drugs that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regular Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, amnase may be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with AMprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is also given with amponavir at the same time, patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of opium, especially if also low doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propyl alcohol content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Apgeneral should be set out in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors, diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia, or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus have been reported.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases that could be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug addicts, such as a longer lasting antiretroviral therapy and the associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In the case of hemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase in hemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and hemorrhage are present.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency, antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections that lead to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial etology is assumed (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosuppression, higher body mass index) cases of osteoarthritis in particular were reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term treatment of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with a low therapeutic width of Agenerase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have low therapeutic width and can also display the mediums of the cytochrome P450 Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width of Agenerase with Ritonavir may not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are metabolized via CYP2D6 and are associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin causes 82% reduction in the AUC of amponavir which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In attempting to balance the humiliated plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, adverse reactions to the liver were frequently observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Ambroavir can be humbled through the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient is already taking St. John's wort, the amber mirrors and, if possible, check the viral load and remove the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if Nelfinavir is administered along with amponavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increase for Cmax by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amponavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of amponavir were performed twice daily and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg knight avir twice a day).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma, which were obtained twice daily with the combination of amponavir (600 mg twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendations for simultaneous administration of amponavir and Kaletra can not be given, but close monitoring is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was carried out in combination with Didanosine in combination with Didanosine, but due to the antacide component of Didanosine it is recommended that the revenue of Didanosin and Agenerase lies at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment of caviar in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and available limited data suggests that nevirapine may reduce the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Should these drugs be used at the same time, caution is required as delavirine might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Caution is advised when these drugs are used together; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be performed, as accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on delavirine is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous dispensation of amprenavir and rifabutin resulted in an increase in the plasma concentrations (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193%, resulting in a rise in the side-effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin along with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin is recommended to at least one half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with erythromycin in combination with erythromycin have not been carried out, but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in the Cmax of ketoconazole in the plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to the 2,69fold compared to the value, which after 200 mg ketoconazole was observed once daily without simultaneous use of fossils with ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other drugs that are listed below, including mediums, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may lead to interactions if they are used together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with atase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as apathy, as it may cause resorption disorder.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulsants known as enzyme-inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amponavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Israodipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous intake of asgenera can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase the associated side effects with PDE5 inhibitors, including hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study where Ritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in subjects, the fluoresonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous administration of Agenerase with kritonavir along with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">With HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected at the same time administration of Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma level increases of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of this medicine is not recommended with amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilizing the mirror is recommended, as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous administration of amponavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase must not be used together with an orally taken Midazolam (see Section 4.3), while caution must be taken with the simultaneous use of Agenerase with parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other protein inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Midazolam by 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered along with amponavir, patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of opium, particularly if also low doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can currently be given as to how the amprenatal dose is to be adjusted if Amprenavir is administered with methadone at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1996">Simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase is recommended for increased control of INR (International Regular Ratio) because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the anthrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods of contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended with simultaneous administration of apgenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medicine may be used only after careful balancing of the possible benefit for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lactating rats, amprenavir-related substances were detected, but it is not known whether amponavir is passed into the breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was given to Amprenavir from the incineration of the uterus to the end of the lactation period, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Amprenavir to the dam.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Agenerase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most adverse events associated with Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, occurred early and rarely led to treatment failure.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clear whether or not they are associated with taking aporiasis or another medicine at the same time, or whether they are a result of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg Agenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1% of patients, as well as under the treatment of any laboratory changes (grade 3 to 4) are performed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and potential subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsozera fat accumulation (breastfeeding).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 antiretroviral non-pre-treated persons treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the PROAB 3006 study, 245 NRTI- previously treated patients under Amprenavir performed 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs for a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0,001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes usually were mild to moderately pronounced, erythematous or makulopapular nature, with or without itching and occurred usually during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment had to be stopped with amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term treatment of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency, antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients who received 600mg Agenerase twice daily with low dose of doses (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of adverse events (Grade 2 to 4) and lab abnormalities (Grade 3 and 4) were similar; an exception were elevated levels of triglyceride and CPK values, which occurred in patients who received agenerase together with low dosed knight avir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of an overdose, the patient is aware of signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8), if necessary, necessary supportive measures are to be initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the process of viral gag- and gag pol- polyproteins with the result of formation of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was examined both on acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemm Concentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is located in the range between 0.012 and 0.08 µM with acutely infected cells and amounts to 0,41 µM in chronically infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The relationship between the activity of Amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans has not yet been defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretrovirally not pretreated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as in other Ritonavir treatments with proteaseinhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg kritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 trial, a virological failure occurred up to 48, whereby 14 isolates could be genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic isolation of 13 of 14 children in which a virological failure occurred within 59 patients with protease inhibitors demonstrated resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, M46I / L, I47V, G48V, I50V, I54L / M / T / V, Q58E, D60E, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg kritonavir twice daily: n = 107) in patients with protease inhibitors occurred in patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, following the following protease inhibitor mutations:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic analyses based on genotypic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of amponavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, V82A / C / F / G, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased phenotypic resistance to fossils with ritonavir and a reduced likelihood of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutations may be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypic resistance testing, clinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with genotypic data to estimate the activity of amponavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genetic samples associated with a reduced susceptibility to amponavir produces a certain cross resistance against Ritonavir, but the sensitivity to Indinavir, nelfinavir and Saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on the cross-resistance between AMprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral not pre-treated patients in which a Fosamprenavir (one of them showed a resistance to Lopinavir and Saquinavir (three of 25 Isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 Isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 insulates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 insulates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the other hand, Amprenavir reserves its activity against some other proteinase inhibitor-resistant insulates; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early termination of a failing treatment is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits, which may adversely affect the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which patients treated with PI (100 mg twice daily) and Nukleenaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dose knight avir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-loss threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of efficacy is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 had been pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase was tested twice daily in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low doso avir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the expected benefit of" "" "unbundled" "" "anapiculture should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation with PI pre-treated children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration the average duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Amprenavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increase, for Cmax by 30% lowered, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amponavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amponavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous intake of food impacted the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of amponavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of unbound amponavir representing the active share probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amponavir remains constant, the percentage of free active component fluctuates during dosing intervals depending on the overall drug concentration in the Steady State over the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or a substrate of CYP3A4 have to be administered with care if they are given at the same time with Agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The administration of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amponavir exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">AMprenavir is of the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and Agenerase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligrammbase.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of kidney dysfunction on the elimination of amponavir and ritonavir should be negligible.</seg>

<seg id="2078">Simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase is recommended for increased control of INR (International Regular Ratio) because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the anthrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">Simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0,035 mg of ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg Norethindron) resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmin from Amprenavir by 22% or more.</seg>

<seg id="2200">In patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs no clinical experiences are present, therefore the application is not recommended in pre-treated tumours.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study suggest that a lower chance of response to imiquimodine therapy exists in large tumours (&gt; 7.25 cm2).</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimodine was not studied for the treatment of actinent cherbatches on eyelids, inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lip.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are very limited data on the application of imiquimodine for the treatment of acute nuclei in anatomical places outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinent keratose on the underarms and hands does not support the efficacy of this application, therefore such application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions occur frequently, but these reactions proceed normally in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after settling the therapy with imiquimodine cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause great discomfort or are very strong to the patient, the treatment may be exposed for several days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical study revealed that patients with more than 8 active lesions showed a lower overall cure rate than those with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immune-stimulating properties imiquimodine should be applied with care in patients receiving an immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) can be achieved neither after one-time nor after multiple topical application, no recommendation can be given for use during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most frequently shared and probable or possibly associated with the application of imiquimodine cream in related adverse events in the trials with three times weekly treatment were local responses to the location of the treatment of the beers (33.7% of patients treated with imiquimodine).</seg>
<seg id="2212">The most commonly reported and probable or possibly associated with the application of imiquimodine cream in the context of side effects include discomfort in the application area with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The BC185 with Imiquimodine-cream treated basalioma patients from a placebo-controlled clinical trial in phase III reported side effects are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, probably or possibly associated with the application of imiquimodine cream in the context of adverse effects were in these studies a response at the location (22% of patients treated with imiquimodine).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The adverse events reported by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical trials of phase III with Imiquimodine cream treated patients with actinent keratosis are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The clinical indication foreseen according to the study plan shows that these placebo-controlled clinical trials often resulted in local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excloriation / flattening (23%) and edema (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">This evaluation of clinical signs provided by the study plan shows that in these studies involving five times weekly treatment with imiquimodine cream very often occurred to severe erytopics (31%), severe erosions (13%), and to severe tumour formation and scaffing (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials for the treatment of imiquimodine for the treatment of the actinical Keratose, alopecia was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or around the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The inadvertent oral absorption of 200 mg ismiquimodine, which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinical severe side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, was in hypotonia normalized after oral or intravenous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In pharmacokinetic investigations, systemic concentrations of alpha interferons and other cytokines were detected after topical application of Imiquimodine.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies it was shown that efficacy in relation to full healing of the eignices in an imiquimodine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is clearly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">At 60% of the total of 119 patients treated with imiquimine, the cervix warts healed completely; this was the case with 20% of the 105 patients who had treated placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 patients treated with imiquimodine, compared to 5% of 161 male patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimodine in five times per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficial basal cell carcinoma with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">Data from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%) of all treated patients were clinically healed and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimodine in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week treatment-free time period, was examined in two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic active lesions within a cohesive 25 cm2 treatment area on the scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The single-year data from two combined observation studies indicate a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The permitted indications of external events, actinical keratosis and superficial basal cell carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimodine n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of imiquimodine could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">Minimal systemic absorption of the 5% Imiquimodine cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute keratosis was observed during the three times weekly application for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations of drug in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and numbed 0.1, 0,2 and 1,6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 pouches).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the two-hour half-life after subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of imiquimodine after topical application on MC-affected skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with acute core cell carcinoma or superficial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study on the dermal application conducted for four months resulted in no similar effects with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice on three days a week did not induce tumours in the application area.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is unknown, but since Imiquimodine only has low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagenic, a risk for man due to systemic exposure is regarded as very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumours were present in the group of mice treated with the active-free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>
<seg id="2242">It can harm other people even though they have the same symptoms as you. − If any of the effects listed you have significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2243">● Advantages (Condylomata acuminata) that have formed on the skin in the genitals (sexual organs) and anus (anus) ● superficial basal cell carcinoma This is a common, slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If it remains untreated, it can lead to deprivation, especially in the face - therefore early detection and treatment is important.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Actinent nuclei are rough areas of the skin that occur in humans, which have been exposed to much of the solar radiation during their previous life.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should only be applied in the face and scalp in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most suitable treatment for you.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Aldara Cream supports your body's immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to combat the superficial basal cell carcinoma, the actinical keratosis or the virus responsible for infection with figs.</seg>
<seg id="2248">O If you have previously used Aldara cream or other similar preparations, please inform your doctor before you start treatment. o Inform your doctor if you have problems with your immune system. o Use Aldara cream until the area to be treated is healed after a previous medical or surgical treatment. o Avoid contact with eyes, lips and nasal mucosa.</seg>

<seg id="2251">If this daily cleaning is not performed under the foreskin, swelling, skin irritation or difficulty of withdrawing the foreskin can be expected with increased occurrence of skin engagements.</seg>
<seg id="2252">Do not apply Aldara cream in the urethra (urethra), in the vagina (vagina), cervix (cervix) or within anus (anus).</seg>
<seg id="2253">Taking other medicines have serious problems with your immune system, you should use this medication for no more than a treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2254">If you have sexual intercourse with genital warts during the genital area, treatment with Aldara cream after sexual intercourse (not before) must be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use other medicines or have recently used it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Breastfeed your infant during treatment with Aldara cream, as it is not known whether Imiquimodine occurs in breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case of tilting, basal cell carcinoma and actinical keratose (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream to the clean, dry skin area with the cowards and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is completely absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with warts under the foreskin must withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area under it (see section 2 "What do you have to consider before applying Aldara Crème?").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>
<seg id="2261">For 6 weeks apply a sufficient amount of Aldara cream for 5 days a week to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area.</seg>

<seg id="2263">Tell your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you do not feel comfortable during the use of Aldara cream.</seg>
<seg id="2264">If your skin responds too strongly to the treatment with Aldara cream, you should not use the cream further, wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2265">A reduced number of blood cells can make you more susceptible to infections; it can cause a blue stain to rise quickly, or it can cause fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects significantly affect you or notice side effects that are not stated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas you applied to Aldara cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Usually these are lighter skin reactions which end up again within about 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally some patients notice changes in the location (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, shredding, skin irritation, blisters, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally some patients suffer from changes at the location (bleeding, inflammation, wound secretion, sensitivity, swelling, small swollen areas in the skin, tingling, feeling of warmth or discomfort), inflammation of the nasal mucosa, nasal pains, diarrhea, acute core pain, redness, facial swelling, ulcers, limb pain, fever, weakness or chills.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme sales in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms which are not associated with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage it.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of the MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, which complicate movements, decreased lung capacity, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should be administered in a hospital or clinic with revitalizing devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was mainly focused on the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness has also been measured (by examining its effect on the reduction of the GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered GAG concentrations in urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children exhibited a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthralgia (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion center.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measure of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated rate of heart), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may react strongly hypersensitive to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information every year, which may be known, review and, where necessary, update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The producer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive Aldurazyme regarding the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the Company Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the marketing of Aldurazyme across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammalian cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, Eierstock of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions defined as any associated side effect occurring during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be performed in an appropriate clinical environment in which revitalizing facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that virtually all patients form IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reactions have to be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">There is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break, due to the theoretically increased risk of a hypersensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment it is necessary to proceed cautiously.</seg>
<seg id="2296">Treat 60 minutes before the start of infusion with medications (antihistamines and / or antipyretics) to minimize the potential incidence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a slight or moderate infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or reduction of infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the event of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms have been reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen shall be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction in infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous response has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procaine, because there is a potential risk of interfering with the intracellular intake of larvonidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Experimental studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns that were exposed to larvae about breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related responses, which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions related to Aldurazyme, which were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older for a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table following the following frequencies: very common (≥ 1 / 10); often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory severe reactions, including bronchospasm, breathing and facial oil (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug effects related to Aldurazyme, which were reported during a Phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly severe expiration form and treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, a serum conversion occurred within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment, whereby the patients at the age of 5 came to a serum conversion in the age of 5 (average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 study (or up to early retirement from the study), 13 / 45 patients showed no detectable antibodies by radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP) assay, including 3 patients with whom it was never released.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with missing to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the GAG mirror in the urine, while a variable reduction of GAG in urine was detected in patients with high antibody titre.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro, which did not seem to interfere with the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of undesirable drug reactions, although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme substitution therapy is one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrats and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient readjustment of enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Following IV infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes most likely via mancan-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study involving 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study covering the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients had the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FeV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change in the expected FeV and the absolute enrollment in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme each week for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme compared the placebo group to improve lung function and salviability shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study, an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects ranged from up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme Group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as highlighted in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage FeV is not clinically significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased further proportionately to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with an Hepatomilaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a significant drop in the GAG-level was found in the urine (µg / mg of creatinine), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous manifestations of disease between patients taking into account clinically significant changes across five efficiency variables (expected percentage normal FeV, distance in 6-minute walk, movement area of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted, in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients who were 5 years old at the time they were admitted (16 patients with the severe follow-up form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased Gag- Mirrors in Harn in Week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were determined according to the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe delay form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed a normal mental development speed whereas in the older patients with severe delay form were limited or even no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a Phase 4 study, investigations into pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosage regimens were performed on the GAG mirrors in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosage schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged under 5 years of age was similar to that of elderly and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on conventional safety pharmacology studies, toxicity with a unique gift, toxicity with repeated administration and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data cannot detect any particular dangers for the human being.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with Cisplatin (another drug against cancer) in patients who have not received chemotherapy (medicines for cancer) and "maligne" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body) and is likely to spread slightly to other parts of the body. • advanced or metastatic "non-small" lung cancer that does not attack the squamous cell.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In patients who have not previously been treated, Alimta is used as sole therapy in combination with cisplatin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, patients should take a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during the treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, a "anti-emetics" (remedy against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent fluid deficiency) should be given before or after the administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood pattern changes or where certain other side effects may occur, the treatment should be postponed, lowered or the dose decreased.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetry thus slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of pemetremixed into its active form is easier to take in cancer cells than in healthy cells, which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and longer active duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was investigated in a major study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">In addition, Alimta was compared with gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1,725 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin showed an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months with the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months, compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">However, in both studies, patients in which cancer did not attack the squamous cell were longer alive when administering Alimta compared to the comparable medication.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued an approval to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. for the marketing of Alimta in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each side-through-bottle must be released with 4,2 ml 0,9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary do- sis is taken from the piercing bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">In combination with cisplatin, ALIMTA is indicated for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer except for overlaid epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with Lo- Kal advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer except for overlaid plate-epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of body surface (KOF) is administered as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion about a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the emetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">The reduction of frequency and severity of skin reactions must be given a corticosteroid in the day before and on the day of the pemetrexed administration and on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of pemetremixed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period and for another 21 days after the last pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) during the week before the first pemetrexed dose and after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who receive telemetrexed, a complete blood pattern should be created before each gift, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and thrombocyte counting.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose examination must take place in consideration of the anadirs of the blood image or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the preceding treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After the recovery, the patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients develop non-hematological toxicity ≥ degree 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA should be terminated if a haematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity grade 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose inductors or so on the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical trials showed no evidence that patients aged 65 years of age or over the age of 65 have an increased risk of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustments were necessary for patients with a creatinine clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which should be recommended for all patients recommended dose adjustments.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a reduction in liver function of &gt; 1.5 times higher Bilirubin- Border value and / or transaminase values of &gt; 3.0 times the upper limit value (in case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5,0-fold the upper limit value (for the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with respect to bone marosuppression and Pemetremixed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrophoscount regains a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte number once again reaches a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophils, thrombocytes and maximum non-hematological toxicity observed in previous cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 haematological and non-matological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neutropenia were deemed polluted if a pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with pemetremixed must be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce the toxicity of treated toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Creatinin Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid concurrent nonsteroidal antiphlogistika (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cylacid (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients prescribed for a pemetremixed therapy must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, preexisting hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with a clinically significant accumulation of liquid in the transcellular space a drainage of the effusion prior to the pemetrexed treatment should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with pemetrexed, when this active ingredient is usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated live vaccine (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible degradation of the reproductive ability by means of pemetrexed, men should be advised before the treatment course to obtain advice on the preservation of the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-clearing ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g a day) can result in a reduced reoccurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">It is therefore advisable to take care if high doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid can be used in high doses for patients with normal kidney function (creatinine-clearing ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, during the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed avoided (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there is no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life like Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous use with pemetremixed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Regular Ratio) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with ande- ren antimetabolites severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed may not be used during pregnancy, except when necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk of foetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">As the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive ability is made by pemetrexed, men should be advised before the start of treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking account.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether pemetry mixed into breast milk and unwanted effects in the nursing infant cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and the randomised Cisplatin and Pemetrexed as well as 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomised to receive Cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2419">The clinically relevant toxicity grade 3 and 4 was similar to the combined results of three single pemetremixed monotherapy trials (n = 164) of phase 2, except neutropenia (12.8% compared to 5.3%) and an increase in alanine (15.2% compared to 1.9%).</seg>
<seg id="2420">These differences are likely to be traced back to differences in patient population, since the Pha- se 2 trials included both chemonaive and clearly pre-treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metastases and / or abnormal liver function tests.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is a antineoplastic antifolate that exerts its effect by interrupting important folliceous metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that pemetrexed works as an antifolate with several points of attack by blocking thymidylap synthase (TS), Dihydrofolate reductase (GARFT), and the logical enzymes of the de novo biosynthesis of thymidin- and purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicenter, randomised, easy-blind Phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus Cisplatin against Cisplatin in chemonaided pleuramesothelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically significant benefit of a median 2.8-month survival compared to those patients who were only curled with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients receiving the investigational medication (randomised and treated).</seg>
<seg id="2435">A statistically significant improvement in clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnea) in connection with the malignant pleuramesothelioma was shown in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients) compared to the only Cispla- tin arm (218 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2436">The differences between the two arms resulted in an improvement in the lung function parameters in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm and a deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm.</seg>

<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli was compared with a BMI in 391 patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In the two studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who received Alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg, compared to 2,3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, none of the relevant weight loss could be observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are oily spots on the anus, flatus (winch) with a bowel, Stuhldrang, oily / oily chair, Outgoing Orets (rotting), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It must not be applied to patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection of graft patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may not be used in patients suffering from long-term malabsorption syndrome (not enough nutrients from the digestive tract) or cholesterol (liver disease), and in pregnant women or breastfeeding mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited a permit for placing Orlistat GSK in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indexed for weight reduction of adults with overweight (Body-Mass-Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypokaloric, fat-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and adolescents under 18, since there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, since orlistat is only minimally resorbed, it is not necessary to adjust the dosage with older people and for patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• hypersensitivity to the active substance or any other component • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.5) • Chronic malabsorption coitus • Cholestasis • lactation (see section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a low-fat single meal or a fat rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction in diabetes may be accompanied by improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli, because the dosage of antidiabetic should be adapted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who use alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage needs to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy-prevention measures in order to prevent the potential of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">Both in a study on the interaction of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin a lowering of the Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick values (internationally normal-ised ratio, INR) may be influenced (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who have been treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta-carotins remain in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take a supplementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure adequate vitamin intake (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After receiving a one-off dose of Amiodarone, a marginal decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal and related to the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000) and very rarely (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of adverse events known after the launch of orlistat is unknown, as these events were reported voluntarily by a population of some size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to anxiety regarding potential or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and overweight patients without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the launch of orlistat overdose, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals, a rapid regression of any systemic effects caused by the immunizing properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect consists in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active Serin residue of gastric and pankatic lipassions.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical trials showed that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, inhibits the absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day in combination with a hypokaloric, fat-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomization), was evaluated as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a percentage of those study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average dietary change in the Gesamtcholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (initial value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (baseline 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (baseline 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At waist circumference, the average change -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103,7 cm) and placebo -3.6 cm (initial value: 103,5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg of orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in the plasma could be detected only sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0,02 µmol) and without signs of an accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed lactone ring) and M3 (M1 after separation of the N-Formyl-leucine group), were identified in a study with obese patients (M1 after separation of the N-Formyl-Leucin group).</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies, which are a strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (like cisplatin), and chemotherapies that are moderate to nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a medicinal product that can be used as an anti-emetics).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use of patients under 18 years of age is not recommended, because there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies on 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies which are strong and moderate nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In the 24 hours following chemotherapy, 59% of patients treated with aloxian were not vomiting (132 out of 223), 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In the case of chemotherapy, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of the patients treated with Aloxi were not vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 from 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">March 2005, the European Commission granted approval to the company Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the marketing of Aloxi in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in severe chemotherapy due to cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate-etogenic chemotherapy because of a cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of aloxion for the prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a highly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Because Palonosetron can prolong the colon assay, patients with amnesty exposure or signs of a subacute idiom should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable with simultaneous dispensing of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or for patients with which the Qt interval is extended or which tend to be prolonged.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi is not to be used either to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not block the activity of the five chemotherapeutics examined against tumors (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a one-time intravenous Palonosetron dose and a Steady State- Concentration of oral Metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone, chlorpromazine, fluoxetine, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, chlorhexetine, ritonavir, sertraline and terbinafine) had no significant effect on the palonosetron Clearance.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for using Palonosetron in human pregnancies is not recommended, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events were observed in a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), at least possibly associated with Aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reaction to the location (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were given in post marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar occurrences of adverse events as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-effect relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out, but due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably not effective therapy for alopying.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received moderate chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and 250mg / m2 of Dolasetron (half-life 7.3 hours) were given intravenously in day 1 without dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin and 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared with patients who received 32 mg Ondansetron, which were given intravenously in day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies of moderate chemotherapy and the study of highly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to preliminary clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the Ion channels involved in ventricular death and replication and to prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the ECG effects of Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption following intravenous administration, a slow elimination of the plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average terminale half-life of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area below the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportional in the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 μg / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Following intravenous palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, 11 testicular cancer patients ranged from day 1 to day 5 (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations show that the total textual position (AUC0- ∞) reached at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg Palonosetron was comparable to that after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg. however, the Cmax was higher after the one-time injection of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolism showed that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the Isotherapy CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron as unaltered agent made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous bolt injection for healthy subjects, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminale elimination diet is increased and the average systemic exposure with Palonosetron increases, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered sufficient for the maximum of human therapeutic exposure, suggesting low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 Out of preclinical studies, evidence suggests that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular death and replication and can prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded in about 30 times the therapeutic exposure in humans), given daily over two years, resulted in increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marrow) and skin tumours in rats, but not mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is determined by humans for one-time application, the relevance of these results is regarded as low for the human being.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative opinion in which the approval of the drug induced to treat hepatitis C was recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means Alphéeon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same medicinal effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also known as" "" "reference medicinal products" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic investigation the liver tissue damages damage, moreover, the values of the liver enzyme Alanin aminotransferase (ALT) are elevated to the blood level.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which stimulates it to form the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Alpheon manufacturers presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of patients with Hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared to the efficacy of the reference medicinal product to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients reported after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was stopped (i.e. no sign of the virus was detected in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been expressed that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed will not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease progressed again in more patients than with the reference medicinal product; moreover, Alphéeon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test carried out in the study to investigate the question of how far the medicine responds to an immune response (i.e. the body produces antibodies - special proteins - against the drug) are not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected infirmiations (crack or cut wounds), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used for the treatment of infections, which are demonstrably or presumably caused by methicillinseed resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo does not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years, the surface area to be treated may not exceed 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together in Hautwunden, about 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (eiterstuffed cavities in the body tissue) or infections caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation at the job site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo were outweighed in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmiations, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. approval for the placing on the market of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of a sensitization or severe local irritation by the application of Retapamuline ointment the treatment should be stopped, the ointment carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamines should not be used for the treatment of infections, in which MRSA is known as pathogen or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">The efficacy of retinaminulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected position occurs after a 2- or 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamines and other topical remedies on the same surface area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations, which were achieved in humans after topical application on skewed skin or infected surface wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After a simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg. of ketoconazole, the middle Retapamentum AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamin- ointment increased by 81% on a reduced skin of healthy adult men.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosage adjustment is not required if topical retention is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in terms of a statement regarding effects on birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamuline ointment should only be used during pregnancy, if topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retapamines is preferable to the application of systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether breastfeeding should be continued or stopped or the therapy should be continued with Altargo, it is necessary to weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of altargo therapy for woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have applied altargo, the most commonly reported adverse effect was irritation at the place of discharge, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of function Retapamentum is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance which is isolated by fermentation of Clitopilus fittederianus (formerly pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of retention is based on selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a certain binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data suggests that the binding site ribosomal protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the peptide transfer centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, block partial P-binding interaction and prevent normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of retapamulin at at least some types of infection appears questionable, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in vitro activity of Retapamin- to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of non-response to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a healthy adult study, 1% Retapamine ointment was applied daily under occlusion and applied to the skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">From 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamine ointment twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Samples were taken on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before the medication and children aged 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 was reduced to 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the retina inulin IC50 for PGP escapement.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamentum in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies of oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro investigation on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in mouse-lymphoma-test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in rats-microkernel-test for in-vivo examination of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">Neither male nor female rats showed signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, resulting in an exposure of up to 5 times higher than the highest estimated exposure in humans (topical application on 200 cm2) skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats, oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above)), developmental toxicity (reduced body weight of fetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity were detected.</seg>

<seg id="2724">Ambienza is used within the framework of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby the protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immunization and it is ensured that the vaccination contained in two doses can be completed.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is required for hepatitis A or B, Ambirix may be given or another hepatitis B or B vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by attaching the immune system (the natural defences of the body), as it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects viruses and surface antigens as" "" "alien" "" "and generates antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambient rix contains the same components as the Vaccine-Adult approved since 1996 and the accine of the children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are given a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence of the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children, Ambienza took a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations for hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambirix's degree of protection was similar in a six-month and a 12 month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, fatigue (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambient rix may not be used in patients who may react hypersensitive to the active ingredients, one of the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals a permit for the marketing of Ambirix in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standard vaccination plan with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster dose for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B is desired, the appropriate monovalent vaccines or combination vaccine can be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B (anti-HBsAg) antibody and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) - are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully secured if immunocompetent persons who have responded to a hepatitis B vaccine require a booster shots as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory for non-detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate options for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the vaccine administered.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardisation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended, containing 360 ELISA units forming a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of hematalysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody value after priming, so that in these cases the gift of additional doses may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intramuscular injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal result, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In case of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disturbances, however, Ambirix may be subcutaneously injected because in these cases it may result in bleeding after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix is administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection, tetanus, azellular pertussel, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influx vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or combined with a combined massage mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects it is necessary to assume that there is possibly no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matchiness, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was similar to the frequency observed in the earlier thiomerisation and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical studies, 2029 vaccines were administered to a total of 1027 vaccinations at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants aged between 12 and 15 years, Ambirix was compared with that of the 3-dosed combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a basis of calculation per vaccination dose, but not on a basis of calculation per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix at 50.7% of the test subjects, compared with 39.1% in the subjects after a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had given ambition had pain, compared to 63.8% in the test subjects, who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matchiness was comparable per proband (i.e. over the whole vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who received Ambirix, compared to 36.2% in the subjects who received the 3-dosed combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of severe pain and matchiness was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dosed vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year-old vaccinations, the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgruppe was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3-dosed combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11--year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccinations that reported severe adverse events during the 2-doses-vaccination scheme with Ambirix or during the 3-doses vaccine with the combination of 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted on vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the seroconversion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The seroconversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study carried out at 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was worthless, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after the addition of the 3-dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1- to 11-year-olds one month after completion of the full vaccine series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccinations were either a 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be demonstrated over at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunoreaction observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-olds, it was shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunisation in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme to the in the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year at the same time was administered with the discovery of a combined diet, tetanus, azellular pertussel, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influx vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and seroconversion rates as for the previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after resuspening by examining any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2777">The hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by virus-containing food and beverages, but can also be transmitted through other ways such as bathing in waters contaminated by sewage.</seg>
<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may possibly require a stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix may not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series was completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is already infected with Hepatitis A- or Hepatitis B Virus prior to the administration of both vaccine doses (though you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to that of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection can not be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any part of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can express itself by itching skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B, if you / your child has a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly protect hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the second vaccination dose is usually administered).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / her child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccine dose (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccination protection prior to the end of the vaccine series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, with people suffering from severe blood clotting disorders, it is injected under the skin and not into the muscle. • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your body's own defense / or if you / your child is undergoing a haemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambienza can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines (including those that you can get without prescription) or if you / your child was recently vaccinated / has received / has received immunoglobuline (antibodies) or is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as many extremities as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nonetheless be sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2797">♦ very common (more than 1 case per 10 decimed doses): • pain or discomfort on the spot or redness • Matchiness • irritability • headache • lack of appetite</seg>
<seg id="2798">♦ A frequent occurrence (up to 1 case per 10 decimed doses): • swelling at the injection point • fever (over 38 ° C) • drowsiness • Gastro-intestinal discomfort</seg>
<seg id="2799">Other side effects reported days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or single vaccines against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (less than 1 case per 10,000 decimed doses) are:</seg>
<seg id="2800">These include localized or extended rashes that may itch or inflate, swelling of the eye contours and the face, aggravating breathing or swallowing, sudden loss of blood pressure and unconsciousness.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data, which have become known since obtaining the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP believes that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was only placed in traffic in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to small patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonastaps can also be used in patients at the age of over one month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonastaps - split by several single doses to the meals - swallowed, mixed into the food or administered via a gastrointestinal hose (through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, as Ammonse could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo (a fake medication, i.e. without drug).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonastaps can also result in loss of appetite, abnormal blood pressure, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or taste, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevents too high ammonia values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonse was approved under "exceptional circumstances" because of the rarity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information to this medicine is available.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients with a complete enzyme shortage already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect that manifests itself after the first month of life) there is an indication for use if a hyperammonic encephalopathy is present in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake necessary for the patient's growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight above 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornicotylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinatynthetase deficiency have to receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swallowing, as there is a risk of the development of esophagus diarrhea if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as associated with sodium retention and odema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate are carried out via the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is unknown; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous injection of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), a slowdown of neuronal proliferation and increased loss of neurons occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a decreased number of functioning nerve endings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted in humans into breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during lactation (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS 56% of patients had at least one undesired event (AE) and 78% of these undesirable events were assumed that they were not connected to AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old abnormal patient who developed metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactic acid, severe hypocemia, tank topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">An overdose case occurred in a 5-month-old infant with an accidential single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms start with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound, which is conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stoichiometrically, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 Patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram received sodium phenylbutyrate is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that diagnosis is made early and treatment is started immediately in order to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was previously almost always infringed, and the disease itself led to death itself in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with its nitrogen-free analogues in the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemodialysis, using alternative methods of nitrate elimination (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns (but within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyperammonia encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the orniintranscarcity deficiency), which recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological state may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in the liver and kidneys with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by adding a single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis for individuals as well as repeated gifting of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">Phenylbutyrate and its metabolites were also studied in cancer patients based on intravenous dosage of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected 15 minutes after the intake.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea cycle disturbances or haemoglobinopathies, phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was not detected next morning after nightly fasting, no phenylacetate in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with liver cirrhosis who were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma levels were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">The medicine is excreted within 24 hours to about 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">Following the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrate had no gunhardest effects with toxic and non-toxic doses (study 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is taken orally (infants and children who can't swallow any tablets, or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a gastropod or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight above 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (particularly branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornicotylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat-flutes were exposed to phenylacetate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrate) before birth, lesions occurred in the pyramids of the cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old abnormal patient who developed metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactic acid, severe hypocemia, tank topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Stoichiometrically, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram received sodium phenylbutyrate is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in the treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological state may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyrate in granular form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected 15 minutes after the intake.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the durations of the shelf life, the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of no more than 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">The small measuring scoop contains 0.95 g, the middle measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine by a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, because sodium phenylbutyrate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndromes" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in an unstable angina (a form of chest pain with different thicknesses) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) (abnormal measurement value in electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of angioox in case of a few administration or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) was compared with Heparin (another antibody) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patient frequently used a stent (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as Abciximab and Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without administration of GPI - in the prevention of new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year overall as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, Angiox was as effective as heparin with regard to all indicators, except for severe bleeding, in which it was much more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Bivalirudin, other hirudine or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who have recently had a bleeding, as well as in people with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable substitute for heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd a permit for the placing of Angiox in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina / non-ST-uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in an emergency intervention or when an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous 0.1 mg / kg stub followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is carried out in other cases, an additional bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours according to clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angioox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous injection of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an intravenous IV infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single bolus administration from Angiox has not been examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the incidence of low ACT levels, the reconstituted and diluted drug should be carefully blended before use and the dose of the bolus dose should be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT attaches to more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are undergoing a PCI (whether treated with ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is less than 225 seconds, it is recommended to administer a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg and retest the ACT 5 minutes after the second shot dose.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which were included in the Phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which resulted in approval, the ACT attaches to an average of 366 ± 89 seconds following the application of the Bivalidate Bolus without dose adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients Angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with Angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the IV administration of unquestioning heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of low molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredient or against hirudine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to malfunctioning of the hemostasis system and / or irreversible intestinal endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bivalirudine is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if the most bleeding of the arterial points occurs in the case of PCI patients under Bivalirudin, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can generally perform bleeding during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients receiving Warfarin and treated with Bidated Rudin, a monitoring of the INR (International Regular Ratio) should be taken into consideration in order to ensure that the value after settling the treatment with Bivalirudin again reaches the pre-treatment level.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge about the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolysis or thrombocyte aggregations), it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivaliruine with thrombocyte aggregations or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological staining parameters are regularly monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental studies are inadequate in relation to the effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unquestioned heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalidation group and in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Heavy haemorrhages were defined according to ACUITY and Timi scales for severe bleeding like in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy haemorrhages performed significantly less often than in the groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and Bivalidation Drudine plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage or hemorrhage in the puncture area requiring a radiological or surgical intervention, reduction of haemoglobin mirror ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding edge, reoperation due to a bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed bleeding-localizations that occurred with more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" points of point, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with Bivalirudin in 6000 patients undergoing PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalidation group and in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy haemorrhages significantly decreased significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects not listed above were reported in practice after extensive use and are grouped according to system organ classes listed in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of an overdose, the treatment with Bidated Rudin must immediately break off and the patient closely monitor the signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox includes Bidated Rudin, a direct and specific thrombinoid inhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic centre and on the anion binding region of thrombin, regardless of whether thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin on thrombine, and thus its effect, is reversible, because thrombine, on its part, slowly cleans the bond of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, thereby regenerating the function of the active center of Thrombine.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, Bivalirudin was unable to induce thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS) in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, Bidated Rudin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anti-inflammatory effect, which is demonstrated by prolonging ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed in the following cases, an additional bolus of 0.5mg / kg bivaliruine should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.75mg / kg / h should be increased.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study unquestionable heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / non-ST-uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to receive a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before beginning the angiography (at the time of randomisation) or with PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients, which required angiography within 72 hours, were evenly distributed across the 3 arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had recurring ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent angiography within 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30 day- and 1-year endpoint for the total population (ITT) and for patients receiving Aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol (before angiography or before PCI) are presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>
<seg id="2933">ACUITY study; 30-day and 1-year risk difference for combined ischemic endpoint and its components for patients who received aspirin and clopidogrel according to protocol *</seg>
<seg id="2934">Patients, Aspirin and Clopidogrel according to the protocol, Arm A Arm B Arm C UFH / Enox Bival B- A C- A Bival + GPIIb / IIIa + GPIIb / IIIa Risk Diff.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The frequency of bleeding both in the ACUITY- and the Timi-Dimensions up to Day 30 for the Total population (ITT) and for patients who received Aspirin and Clopidogrel according to the protocol is shown in table 9.</seg>
<seg id="2936">Patients, Aspirin and Clopidogrel total population (ITT) according to protocol UFH / Enox Bival Bival UFH / IIIa (N = 2911) GPIIb / IIIa (N = 4604) (N = 4604) (N = 4604) (N = 4604) (N = 4604) (N = 4604)%%%.</seg>
<seg id="2937">* Clopidogrel before angiography or before PCI 1 A severe hemorrhage was defined as one of the following: intracranial, retroperito-neural, intraocular hemorrhages or hemorrhaging in the puncture area, reduction of haemoglobin level ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding area, reduction of haemoglobin level of ≥ 3 g / dl with blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple endpoints of a randomised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2), are presented in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angioxin in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalirudin were evaluated in patients who underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that a peptide as a peptide reaches a catabolism in its amino acid compound with subsequent reuse of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolism resulting from the splitting of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence through thrombin is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic centre of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The elimination takes place in patients with normal kidney function after a process of first order with a terminale half-life of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on conventional safety pharmacology studies, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot identify any particular dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Toxicity in animals in repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks during exposure to the 10-fader of the state-state plasma concentration) was limited to overshooting pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Side effects as a result of longer-term physiological exposure as a response to non-homeostatic coagulation were not observed after short-term exposure to those in clinical application, even at very much higher dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2947">If the production of the ready-to-use solution is not performed under controlled and validated aseptic conditions, it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Angiox is a freeze-dried powder in single dose transfusion bottles made of type 1 glass to 10 ml, which is sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and sealed with a cap of pressed aluminium.</seg>
<seg id="2949">5 ml sterile water for injection purposes are given in a detoxification bottle and slightly waved until everything is completely dissolved and the solution is clear.</seg>
<seg id="2950">5 ml are taken from the piercing bottle and diluted with 5% glucose solution for injection or with 9 mg / ml (0,9%) sodium chloride solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5mg / ml of bivaliruine.</seg>
<seg id="2951">The owner of the marketing authorization is correct, the studies and pharmacovigilance activities outlined in the Pharmakovigilance Plan, as outlined in version 4 of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and in module 1.8.2 of approval for placing on the market, as well as any subsequent changes to the RMP agreed by the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2952">According to the CHMP Guideline for risk management systems for human medicines, the revised RMP should be submitted at the same time with the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR).</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is administered subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin for the regulation of glucose (sugar) in the blood or can not effectively process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin-lulisin differs very slightly from the human insulin and the change means that it acts more quickly and has a shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been used in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body is unable to produce insulin, in two studies involving a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Apidra has been studied in a study of 878 adults with type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to operate effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin sensitivity was observed after six months.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, lowering of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% with human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to inert lulisin or any of the other components, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of Apidra in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be applied as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the area of the pancreas.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced gluconeogenesis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism, the insulin requirement in patients with a limitation of the liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc delaying, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production can change the insulin requirement.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 insufficient dosing or discontinuation of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and a diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another type of insulin or insulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of a hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when changing the treatment plan.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopypyramid, fibrate, fluoxetine, propoxycycline, propoxylic and sulfonamide-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the symptoms of adrenergics such as beta blockers, clonidine, Guanethidin and reserpine may be diminished or absent from the symptoms of adrenergic counter-regulation.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and Humaninsulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin discharges into human breast milk, but generally insulin does not exceed the mother's milk, nor is it absorbed by oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the undesirable clinical trials advertised by clinical studies, grouped according to system organ classes and sorted according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence (exceeding 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 10; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on available data is not predictable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold-welding, cool and pale skin, tiredness, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, drowsiness, excessive perseverance, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is missed to continuously change the injection point within the injection area, subsequently a lipodystrophy can occur at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycaemias involving unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by an appropriately trained person, or by intravenous glucose administration by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to detect the cause of the severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that the efficiency occurs faster with subcutaneous GA- be of insulin lulisin and the active duration is shorter than with a cough-manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes mli- tus, insulin-lulisin in the therapeutically relevant dosage range from 0,075 to 0,15 E / kg showed a dose of proportional glucose-lowering effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosm effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosesick effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was obvious that a comparable post-rancidental glycemic control is reached in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, as with normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Was insulin lulisin adjusted 2 minutes before the meal, a better postprandial control was achieved than with a normal normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin-lulisin is applied 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a similar glycemic control is achieved, as with normal insulin, which is given 2 mids before the meal (see figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin for 2 minutes (GLULISIN - previously) before the start of the meal compared to normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin-lulisin at the gift of 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the beginning of the meal compared to human normal-acting insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
