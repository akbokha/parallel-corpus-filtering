&quot; &quot; &quot; the module &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translate website &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be found in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu under Extras Web Site . select the source and target language of the translation from the drop @-@ down list . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated at the point of the whole &amp; URL .
machine translation is very ru@@ di@@ mentary . in the best case bab@@ el@@ fish produces a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , translations should not make important decisions without veri@@ fying the translation beforehand .
only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated by yourself on the Bab@@ el@@ fish page , where you can insert translated texts directly .
the package and package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some extra features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them readily available .
for more information on how to use &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions refer to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or manual .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Set@@ ting extensions ... Open the tab card tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard setup modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that if you have additional software installed , you may have more modules installed on your system .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; it contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; click Tools Cancel . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; crash , or delete the list of cras@@ hes if available .
the panel filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras View filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display begins with the root k@@ not of the document , for example : docum@@ ent@@ Item , all other nodes are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views , in order to view the contents of your local file system .
the feature of &amp; FS@@ View is to graphi@@ cally display ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a tree map . tree @-@ Maps indicates the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose area is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the child objects is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
with &amp; FS@@ View , the size is the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then easily recognized when it is located far down in the folder hierarchy . consequently , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you will be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rect@@ angles have meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched over view color mode can either display depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the mapping of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the various properties of the respective file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display , or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles should be used ( whereby , therefore , display errors can be determined by constraints on the character of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . in addition , you can specify the relative position of the label in the rect@@ angle .
with representation algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be maintained that the area is proportional to the size of the item . with the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always comp@@ lied with . it will draw frames to avoid the ne@@ sting of entries . note that less space for the frame is lost when the rect@@ angle is square .
as division of the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries takes place , the implementation is left up . here , it is necessary for the lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses through frame always advantageous to divide the rect@@ angles that are as square as possible . the best methods in this respect are rows , columns or recur@@ sive branches .
you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry via the menu item View Log in area . instead , a space pattern is drawn into the area of the parent item to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the Picture Gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Picture Gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
when you view the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens which allows you to define the image of the gallery .
the option title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option images per line has a sli@@ der and a rotation panel to adjust the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
the file name of the image indicates whether the file names are shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the check@@ box File size of the image , specify whether the file size is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .

to include the sub@@ folder check box , you can set a sli@@ der or a rotary panel to which level the sub@@ folders will be included .
with the check box original pictures , you will be able to copy if the original pictures should be copied to the gallery .
use the comment file check@@ box to specify a comment file for cap@@ turing images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn colour depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

to play , click on the navigation pane of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to listen to media playback .
changing browser detection adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , which allows you to change browser and operating system recognition for single domains . this is helpful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers .
the default browser recognition of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser , change browser recognition in one of the following options .
changes the password in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that reject access with browsers on the basis of mo@@ z@@ illa . for example , you need M@@ SI@@ E browser recognition to access the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or and hot@@ mail .
pages that do not comply with the W3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identi@@ fier of this out@@ dated browser .
with this option , the default browser detection is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing .
with the menu entry Setup ... you can set the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ pack ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ phot@@ 2 library . of course , each medium and any card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; work together .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; includes fast image editing with basic image processing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE image plugin interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ plug ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion with li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , like &amp; eg ; via the camera or the lens to be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . therefore , you should report problems and possibilities for improvement .
&amp; nbsp ; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problems or requests .... This opens a dialog with an under@@ lined link . if you use these links , your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system . all required information is already entered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ code ; is a project that is supported by a community . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ plug ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ p@@ ist ; then we would like to ask you questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ plug ; and hopefully soon you will be able to answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ code ; visit homepage to find news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ plug ; learn .
the best start to participate &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for registering in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ master ; .
when you start dig@@ ging ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . you can specify a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter a path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here the dat@@ as@@ he@@ et will be saved . this path will remain the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ plug ; will also use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images as the base folder . &amp; Edit ; view each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . during the search of the folder you will get a progress indicator like this :
&amp; digi@@ plug ; dur@@ ess recur@@ sively the library path in its enti@@ rety . you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders except it i@@ ste in hidden folder . you can do this by inser@@ ting an item in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as base folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ ites do not have photos as icons . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , you can also handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Menu Help .
how to set up and work with raw files is described in the Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ settings and Ro@@ h workflow sections .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ pack ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ phot@@ 2 library . of course , each medium and any card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; work together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera then appears as a disk device . the connection can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ code ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transfers over the serial port slowly , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ phot@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ K@@ am can be read reliably . if the ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ phot@@ 2 , you may not see thumb@@ nails or the creation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; digi@@ plug ; is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plugin interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ plug ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules for all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as a user can do . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ plug ; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ code ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag and drop images functions anywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the tree , over the horizontal dividing line or into another application window . the only restriction is that an image cannot be placed in keywords , date list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , raw , movies and audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . so the filter on the file name will only work if this ind symbol view is also displayed . which fields are displayed you can configure in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ ites .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ g ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ pack are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ Properties or after the date on which the album was first created .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . choose to scan album Import pictures . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop there . in the then appearing menu you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . you can also move or copy several photos in the same way . simply select all photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , you must click with the right mouse button on the album and edit album properties in the context menu .
alb@@ um@@ - Coll@@ ections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can group together under a common name . the collection you set will be used to sort your photos by selecting the collection from the toolbar or selecting albums Up collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the collections for collections .
the album date : used when you sort your albums by date with View albums By date .
the buttons el@@ dest , average , new : these set the date to the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . this will first attempt to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file in this folder will be used instead .
when you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ p ; open , the first image in the album will be selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the image with the right mouse button and select Add as album preview . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to place it as a symbol .
an album can only be contained in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ importantly ; support the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list on the bottom left of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . when you select an album , all images are displayed in this album in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these thumb@@ nails with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album for the first time , you have to wait a bit while the preview images are generated . you can avoid using any preview images in the Tools menu .
information for each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview . what information is available can be changed via Edit Controls ; set up the albums page and customize the thumb@@ nail area to suit your needs .
the preview images have help windows , which appear when you leave the mouse poin@@ ter for a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
photos are all you need at &amp; digi@@ pack . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these . you can view all the features that come with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; you can choose between viewing the images , slide show or editing the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by either selecting F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... you will find a guide on how to edit your photos . with the image editing , you can view your photos and change them .
it can happen that &amp; Edit - the functionality you need is not provided . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub @-@ menu of Open . for this , and how to customize it to your needs , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after editing , other image processing programs may cause problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest is to click with the right mouse button on the preview and select Rot@@ ate . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , you can click the preview with the right mouse button and select F2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . keep in mind that you maintain the extension ( .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ p ; delete it , it will be moved to the garbage bin of &amp; k@@ de ; move F@@ 8 image Del@@ ete or Del If you prefer to really delete it , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the view &amp; quot ; My date sli@@ des@@ ks ; organizes your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ code ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date aperture at the bottom of the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords add a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers , which can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search again .
if a keyword is selected , all photos that have been tagged with this keyword will be displayed .
keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ ste@@ eg ; work together so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . so you can also use your keywords in other programs . in addition , the keywords are re @-@ imported when the database is lost once &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the images will be noticed .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My keyword &quot; ; or click on an existing keyword and select a new keyword . if you add a new keyword , after clicking on an existing keyword , this keyword will be the keyword of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired location in the tree and put it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can only be one time in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting keyword processing in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword .
to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the image with the right mouse button and set it in the context menu as an album preview . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to place it as a symbol .
to use the functionality with keywords , you first need to apply your photos with keywords . this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos you selected by a keyword , you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword &quot; ; alternatively , you can click the preview of the images and select the keyword ( s ) from the context menu .
you can design@@ ate a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way you can set a keyword for each person in a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event at which it was made etc .
once you have a photo with keywords , this will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image .
you can remove a keyword by using the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select Remove from the Tags menu . the menu only displays the keywords you have assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a tim@@ eline @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection box that displays the time unit . this displays all associated images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . it will appear in the list below .
includes all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
if you click here , the filter will be deleted and all the images will be displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp will be red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this , you can save a simple search box such as the one described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search key . after you have saved it , it appears in the list .
if you are happy with your selection , press the head OK and the search is done . the results are used in the View My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection once again , you just need to select the corresponding entry from the view My search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you select to edit search , the search form will appear again with the search information entered previously . if you select to edit as advanced search , the dialog will appear for the advanced search to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for searching . for more information , see the Advanced Search Tool .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete the Search list from the contex@@ tual menu .
advanced Search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters that you can search for in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ .@@ s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules are added in line , by operators . an option can be added to this list with search group / search group added or deleted . each option can be associated with others about the logical operations All ... , A ... , No ... or At least ...
&amp; digi@@ tization ; characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows images to compare by comparing these signatures . the lesser the difference between two image signatures , the more they match . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each picture to find a similar one . if you push a picture from somewhere over the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free @-@ hand color sketch : draw a quick sketch and sketch ; find the matching pic@@ s . here too , a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it and move it . move C@@ trl ; left mouse button to drag a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides a luminous table in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L Add to the luminous table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light table and its window open . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; main window , you can quickly open the light table with L Extras illuminated table .
from the preview panel , you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you want to synchron@@ ize the preview from the toolbar and carry a zoo and / or move operations on one of the images , then they will be able to compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you navigate from the toolbar , then the two first images will automatically be loaded into the compartments . use the left mouse button at any preview image to see it in the right pane . this makes it easy to work through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal soldering actions also work directly from the lighting console like F@@ 4 File Edit ....
all image information from the right side of the main window is available in the light table for both thumb@@ nails . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to pi@@ v@@ ot the visible area of the image , you must click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB . in the Pre@@ view mode both images will show the same image area .
the zoom factor works just like in other views . just use the zoom sli@@ der below the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom in . this happens in both images when you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital stock management - away from the modem ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos cap@@ tures , scans or digital photos leads through a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up , find , protect and use your photos . we focus on the procedures for digital photographers the &amp; digi@@ plug ; we focus on downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , group@@ ing , securing , ass@@ essing , archiving , optim@@ ising , waiting and ex@@ porting image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes up , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ ec@@ es and exports the content that has a monetary or cultural value .
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is , in accordance with your definition , data that provide information about or a documentation of other data administered by an application or environment .
I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you don &apos;t even need to find a specific photo without inventory management . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you definitely don &apos;t use &amp; digi@@ plug ; . the approach to save the metadata in both a database and image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving on which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide if you want to have other access to your photos , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure that you have to switch to a larger drive some@@ time .
you may be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times at the same location . if you do enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work procedures , constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % Archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? separating file types makes batch processing easier . separate new ones from old files .
the separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
we also recommend the option to store metadata in the Edit page of the metadata in &amp; Edit . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item from the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? to do so &amp; digi@@ plug ; to them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work starts , as you should now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and a rating to any photo . of course , you can select all images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense , as you can focus on the best photos during the further work .
now let &apos;s proceed with keywords , keywords , as you do with other programs , or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded key words , then &amp; digi@@ plug ; automatically build the tree for you or place the images in the right place . sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by dra@@ gging a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ pack ; updated as it tracks the sub @-@ trees .
the diagram shows how different metadata is overl@@ apped . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata consists of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool for catalo@@ gu@@ ing your metadata .
most people don &apos;t want to let anyone see your photos , you want to share them with your friends , family , photographers and agencies .
look at this panorama . from the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you begin to dream , have associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others who look at your photos the title may be more important than the image itself to generate an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you understand .
it is ok if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a cap@@ tion for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as cap@@ tion . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE even exports them to the cap@@ tion and / or the title of the Web @-@ gallery system . so you don &apos;t have to tell the story a second time .
remember the time before GPS ? when you had to go to another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet from Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now drives with speed of light .
the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are inn@@ um@@ erable and will be deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually dup@@ licate your trips by using images with geographical information . &amp; digi@@ plug ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can use with Google Earth . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use copy@@ rights in order to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all changed versions , i.e. also for the works of others .
the following description tells you what information on the installation page of &amp; digi@@ plug ; as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organization can be used . once this value has been saved , it should no longer be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author title : linked to the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s job title . examples of this can be title : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author field , it must be filled in as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations can be listed here , which offers the picture to others . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture here is given here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright @-@ sections , although they do not provide protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify this in the image . for private persons this is only of little interest for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ tization ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
topics : disk failures , disk failure , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , life time , temperature , data size , spread aber@@ ration
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section we discuss problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery firm , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these precau@@ tions have to be handled and you may not buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold @-@ coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . so it &apos;s about selecting the right one .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even if you have just been written . that &apos;s why they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scratches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CD and DVD , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that seems to work miracles in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux , but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs appear to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
slowly burn with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . also read the media with a description , date &amp; author marks and then store in a clean , dark dry and protected place protected from animals . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk makers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer warran@@ ts include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives : disk error study
shortly : dis@@ ks are the longest to operate in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In case of lower temperatures , the error rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of failure . S@@ MA@@ RT noti@@ fies the im@@ min@@ ent failure .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power loss before you have saved the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems .
while most electrical devices do not account much , this is different for devices with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause locked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed Mo@@ ther@@ boards and other defects . thus , protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able thing resulting in a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs some of the energy slots and gro@@ unding the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in strip .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it provides protection against lightning strike and thus protects the connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should also ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers also provide over@@ voltage cont@@ actors which also have a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically supply battery energy when a power failure occurs . this gives you the opportunity to store your data and keep the system down . if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and and compare its security in case of current disturbances with the costs to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can take you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . finally , you should always remember all cables before you drive on holiday .
the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can mount it as a drive on &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Shared storage is another popular offer where you can store any amount of data .
they are , however , very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are limited to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your images available in full resolution online . the professional version will provide you more in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited storage , which should be verified in reality first .
from the point of view of data security , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and for large companies it is included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are vulnerable to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive .
the worst part is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all these disturbances remain un@@ discovered until you one day open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . no one seems to have ever thought about it . no one seems to have ever thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way of data than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of bugs a year .
Z@@ FS by Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk errors at low levels and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leopard on a GP@@ L compatible license . we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms that Z@@ FS uses and is also available for Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of the work@@ station systems . for not@@ ebooks , the proportion of th@@ ef@@ ts is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to less damage than for example theft or re@@ installation . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ F@@ s , and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . a very good English article can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden interruption during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the major causes of data loss .
digital cameras sensors are 1 @-@ 2 lens settings away from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards 10 meg@@ api@@ xel levels . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xel . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ size sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive you get today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anyone responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by data loss every year . so , secure your data after a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aer@@ op@@ lanes : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they normally concern a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or something like that .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as said above , a common cause of data loss despite backup is panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot of two time points : that of the complete backup and that of the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such backup was made . this backup comes next with the exception that it is only scanned and not ongoing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transferring scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security over s@@ sh .
back up important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium .
this procedure lets you have enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should happen manually after you have made a complete review .
themes : metadata , IP@@ TC stored in the image file , associated X@@ MP files , retain original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the internet .
for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider and re @-@ evaluate all that is said today . unfortunately , there is no other way to be considered a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the fewer variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone today . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for future use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the print expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and the area you want to increase the area you want to increase on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of row if necessary
open Source Standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
PNG was designed as an open source standard that should replace GIF . it can save much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . PNG can recommend gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment in hetero@@ geneous platforms . this format we would recommend to you to save your images .
TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format is adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a license @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers already provide D@@ NG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it some@@ time .
this is possibly one of the reasons why in 2001 , Adobe introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource blocking quot ; -@@ Technology of the 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP fits this because it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when you link between the metadata file and the image file and as mentioned above , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compliant online metadata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI working groups , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera editing , you can use it as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a fine editing you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with Edit Edit , then you should add the metadata again . these were possibly cut off from the other programs .
protect the copy@@ righ@@ ted images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only then in web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; in section Add a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your al@@ locate database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , connect these to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is established , a Fer@@ tig In@@ dic@@ ator will appear at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be displayed . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for your view will be displayed for each file , photos , movies , music , etc on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side@@ bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the tab metadata displays the internal metadata such as ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ plug ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is by clicking on the Download button and then downloading the selection of All . this invites all the photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ plug ; . downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were downloaded safely into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired one with the standard selection methods from &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download it Sel@@ ected . download the selected button until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New Download is available . these images have not yet been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ plug ; in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , of course , only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you want to download or download the selected buttons , a dialog box will appear with which you can select the destination album in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Albums tab . then select the destination album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug ; download the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete all . if you want to delete only a few , you need to select them first and then delete the selected delete .
please note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera . the photos will not be moved to the garbage dump of &amp; k@@ de ; so you should check carefully if the photos have been successfully deleted from the camera before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera view@@ finder , you should do so via the camera menu , as this is much faster .
cameras often do not use particularly meaningful names for the photos . the file names are normally used again after the photos are deleted from the camera . this can result in dup@@ licate file names if you upload photos of different recording studios into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time the image was made into the file name .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder per day will be created automatically .
the Options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two affect the data about the author in the section Standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
for example , if you prefer a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % y@@ - % d % H : % M : % S in the editing field . turn on the date &amp; time option . for further adjustments you should read the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ame option , you have the option to change the file names in lower@@ case . or capital letters if you prefer this .
the new file name , that &amp; digi@@ plug ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be stored and automatically used when you open the camera window for the next time .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the Metad@@ ata page , you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually turned on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the Automatic rotation in the bottom area of the window .
when your camera provides information about the date the photo is made available , &amp; digi@@ plug ; this is used to automatically download sub @-@ albums in the target album while downloading . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a data section , you can read which information your camera might have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually turned off , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn on this option . use the Advanced button and select the Date Based Man@@ age option at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files you want to upload . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the picture selection is done , queries &amp; digi@@ plug ; you where the images should be uploaded . a folder sel@@ ector dialog for the camera appears . select the folder you want and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a generic term in this document . this means a position that is indicated in length and width gra@@ ding and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ pack ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as the direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ites and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , over a post @-@ processing of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical mapping ( manual ) and last by manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit . but there are a few working with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must save this data in the g@@ p@@ x format , since this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ mapping module .
there are different programs for and Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with Phi@@ l Harv@@ ey &apos;s Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ als of hair@@ y coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show European maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; try to give you so much control over his work procedures as possible . there are many settings that the behavior of &amp; digi@@ plug ; change . to access these settings , you need to customize the Edit menu . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left .
select action can be set on embedded preview or start image editing . you can set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ plug ; specify when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author title is a syn@@ onym for author : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to indicate the picture that the photo offers . this does not have to be the author , if this is for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as this is the image of others &amp; quot ; an@@ o. quot ; . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the image will be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions save the data to the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ .@@ This metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ code ; imported without being lost .
save image cap@@ tions as embedded lab@@ eling ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures . this allows your cap@@ tions to be read by other image viewers .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse poin@@ ter rests in the main window over a file . depending on the option selected , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ code can be displayed , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . any file in one &amp; digi@@ p ; album folder that has none of these extensions will be ignored .
you can reset the default settings again by pressing the Ref@@ res@@ h button on the right of each category .
the lighting console &apos;s settings can be set to the default values on this page . however , each time you open the luminous table these settings will be turned on if possible . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can get better viewing results .
by default , the image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can disable the toolbar if you use the image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark and light color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing , this View Mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more information .
with the p@@ n@@ g compression you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG uses a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . this means a low and 9 high compression .
with the option to comp@@ ress TIFF files , you can disable the Def@@ l@@ late compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no effect on image quality since the Def@@ l@@ late algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in ordinary JPEG . when this paragraph is written , metadata was not yet supported but was in the planning .
in previous versions of Edit &amp; Edit , image editing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently , it rapidly develops into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the image editing settings .
the default assumption is that all green pixels are the same . if the bright green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light , this difference creates a lat@@ tice pattern in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera will be used . otherwise , if set , the auto colour balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the standard is the spot@@ lights , so the parts of your images that are burned in due to the inability of your camera to catch the spot@@ lights as a passing white . use the setting colors to trigger some unusual results as it shows the pointed lights in various rose oil . la@@ stly , you can try some parts of the missing information from the top @-@ lights to re@@ construct .
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not so fast satur@@ ating like green and red . &amp; nbsp ; and d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the yet un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want .
if you select the option re@@ construct , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ pack ; image processing . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ thing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a demo @-@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; nbsp ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like this . V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . it generates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for color gra@@ ding correction , as it is performed during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to return it . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ plug ; information on how to translate color information from one color space to the other , so that the colors are as exact as possible .
behavior issues when an image is opened in image editing / Color handling module with raw files start .
color Profile folder Set the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ plug ; examine this folder then during startup .
settings of ICC profiles You have here the ability &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be stored . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your pictures are color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain any color t@@ apping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma doesn &apos;t correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color mapping by yourself .
there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate on how your image would be returned from a device . this is very useful before you print picture , because your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this could be manually corrected instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obviously what color profile is intended for . unfortunately not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension provides the style for the finish : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ plug ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these will then be loaded by &amp; digi@@ plug ; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings brief commands .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the slide show settings should be easy to understand . the upper knob adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display .
the camera characteristics show on the left a list of all the currently supported cameras . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic detection which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , turned on and in the image display mode .
at the bottom , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage cameras . this field will only be active if you have a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you will need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / port , on which you mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to display mode and turn on .
check if &amp; digi@@ plug ; automatically detect the camera . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert them here .
with the option Con@@ ver@@ ting dialog for moving &gt; Show pictures in the tr@@ ash bin , you can set the dialog from &amp; Edit ; when you delete a photo in an album , you will find more details when del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly executed by &amp; digi@@ plug ; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you must save the changes using the button change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can also sign &amp; Edit the welcome screen of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; welcome screen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at startup . this speeds up &amp; digi@@ plug the starting process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
setting the start after new photos for@@ cing &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sing ; searching the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ plug ; this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ plug ; if something is deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ plug ; you know if it should delete it from the database .
various color schemes can be edited in &amp; digi@@ p@@ d ; you can customize the main window to suit your taste . you can select these settings under Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs are defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ plug ; create , you will find more information about it in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; includes fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or from the context menu of the Pre@@ view and Sel@@ ection of the Ads / Edi@@ ting item .
image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ pack ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see Set@@ ting Up Image Processing .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , the magni@@ fication factor and the current image size indicate .
a menu bar at the top and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most needed functions .
the editing functions of the image editing change your photos . none of the functions will change the original photo before you have saved file saving or the button Save from the toolbar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you might need to make a copy of your image before changing it . you can save it with file Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rec@@ over menu or using the button Rec@@ over of the image editing button in the toolbar . you will then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last saving .
almost any image processing action can be und@@ one or restored . you can und@@ o the last action by selecting Edit , Rest@@ ore or Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Rec@@ over from the menu .
if you frequently use this , use the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to und@@ o and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to remember .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; by pressing the return or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be und@@ one or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save it .
you can enter the photo in and out in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : automatically select the magni@@ fication factor
view Full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want this , you can change it in the Edit dialog by &amp; Edit . you can view it from the Edit dialog . see the section for setting up the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select the Print Image from the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sets . whole picture pages can be printed out of your choice . you just need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the Album &quot; Export Response Assistant . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice .
the Edit &amp; Edit ; main window has a side bar at the right edge that provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation arrows , even in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five tabs is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are inver@@ ted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented it , use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions will then be saved .
there is a button next to the Apply button . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done when you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the evaluation section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select them and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field Ur@@ gency . the encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword overview shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keyword used previously in this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is a further relief in the input of keywords in a series of images . if you have entered different keywords , they will be saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords in an image are stored in the keyword keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main screen and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not on the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please refer to the keyword filter section .
the Key@@ word Key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , - date , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right @-@ hand side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw and disc@@ ard keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . as a result , a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword .
in the top example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is no keywords , which reduces the amount to three pictures . they were selected using C@@ trl + a , and after that a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created and realize that it should be one or be , you can easily change this by double clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set a Advanced search across all the elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group@@ ing button . the options then look as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? free space is limited to 1 GB and you won &apos;t want to save the images in full resolution there .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ tise ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come with a predictable defl@@ ection from the actually photograph@@ ed or scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
when the theme comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing work@@ flows . additionally , you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed choices to make you get the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other image editions are by email or web where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB is working so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should you use another color space and have to worry about color management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then click Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to c@@ alli@@ pair my monitor if I chose to work only in s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you are working in a s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to k@@ alli@@ br@@ ate your monitor , because s@@ RGB means that your ; on@@ itor appears on s@@ RGB . if you are working as a color space of s@@ RGB , you either need to use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , synchron@@ ize , Automatic comparison and contrast extend from the Edit Automatic correction menu attempt automatically from your colors to make the best . you &apos;ll need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the Leu@@ st@@ stär@@ ling values over the entire image , leaving the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible without changing its color sh@@ ading . this function is often a magic correction for pictures that are dark or balanced .
balance : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ ance factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . this means that almost every brightness area has the same number of pixels . sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in the image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light border shades and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
extend Con@@ trast : this method improves the contrast and luminous intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the highest possible range and a new ji@@ us@@ hing of all values in between . this is only visible with well @-@ balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance from &amp; digi@@ plug ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is slightly restricted since there is a color space of 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can do the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copy@@ righ@@ ted Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they launch it via the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , it is enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target format has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is indicated as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right up , a hist@@ ogram is shown that changes dynamically as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful since , even in well lit pictures , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadows adjustment can be improved or di@@ mm@@ ed down the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . click on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result shown in the white balance . this will be displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Load buttons do exactly that . any setting of the white balance you set can save you into a text file and load them later .
the Pre@@ ferences button will reset all filter values to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will make a different photo than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image here . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this encoding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed description for using color profiles can be used to consult the Colour Management chapter .
another important tool can be found in the menu under Color Key Cor@@ rection . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously so that you can use them for several photos at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and you will always need the same correction . in the manual for ton@@ ing correction you will find more information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the gra@@ dation tool that you can find under color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; mold color effects provide you with four color effects , a solar active effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ister filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that was created by replacing a partially developed print with a short flash beam and then in@@ vert the development of the image . the colored , dark@@ er areas protected the sensitive phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . this had the effect that the lighter areas dark@@ er and the colors through the second lighting were inver@@ ted . this tool allows you to fine tune this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar process . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . finally , a further increase produces a negative image that is not produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the Solar@@ isation Eff@@ ect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and processed the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , it em@@ belli@@ sh@@ es many photos .
the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for natur@@ alistic photographers . Vel@@ via &apos;s strongly saturated colors are also a few photographers , especially those who have little landscapes .
the Ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the Level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repeat the strength of the ne@@ on light . for large images , the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photos . you can try to experiment the various color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors .
if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the reverse problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple den@@ ial / contrast / g@@ amma the tool is located for improving exposure . even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated , you only need the area of the sli@@ der for the purpose purpose described here . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel , or the selected area . under the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to operate it is to shift the control and make sure that the image changes .
the original and the preview of the image can be viewed on the right side . the preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to set whether the hist@@ ogram is represented by a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear representation is often dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic division is more useful .
three kno@@ bs : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lower for the middle sounds , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color pin@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , medium and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controller that can be used to inter@@ actively alter the output values as in the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a f@@ aded image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatic : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later . for this , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the option Veri@@ fication In@@ dic@@ ator controls all color channels to locate over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only displayed in the preview and there is no effect to see at the final result .
below is an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photograph . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modify Channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel modified by the module :
in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera , the linear mode is usually the most meaningful . for images with large areas of constant color , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you shift a curve section to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with dark@@ er output tones and that the corresponding image pixels become dark@@ er .
on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see . if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly that . any curve that you created can be stored in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
when you create this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadows , middle and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option over exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect to see at the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the Edit &amp; Di@@ d channel mixer ; image editing is a tool for improving the color channels or changing the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of image editing .
the channel selection box lets you select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left pane of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed in comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will appear to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are at the bottom right : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness even if you also use the option mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , because the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the far@@ th@@ . far@@ brau@@ schen is composed of small smoke fake files that don &apos;t appear at the same spot in the color channel . if that &apos;s the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me conversion by reducing the colour first .
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for that purpose . any bl@@ ender setup allows you to save and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option Veri@@ fication In@@ dic@@ ator controls all color channels to locate over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only displayed in the preview and there is no effect to see at the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is activated . the original image can be seen under ( 1 ) and the processed image under ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to reproduce . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , because color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film rolls .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky . thus similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ ge@@ Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . thus similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
Rot@@ ary : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate lun@@ ar light scenes at day@@ time . thus similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ th@@ ora : produces warm light and medium tones as it adds a bit cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of the fate of a print and the re @-@ development in a S@@ epi@@ th@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; applying tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , irrespective of whether it is a color image or not , you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu entry Image texture applying the image processing can be used for this .
relief : shifting this parameter to the right enhances the appearance of the depth and / or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper text effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the digi@@ plug ; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . throughout the image with a colored line , ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white pictures ) , stri@@ k@@ ant@@ ingly surrounds it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative insert an ornamental frame with patterns .
width : is the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the finish decorated with the frame will be greater than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the printing of the images , especially if you have used the tool Accor@@ ding to the aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into a picture at any position . this is also possible in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use@@ . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its features as you need it . the larger the image , the larger the character must be . finally , select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; apply tool template you can put a template over a picture .
the menu Image Tem@@ plates apply in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the template there are no limitations concerning the size and orientation . however , you must take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for the reduction of file size of the template . if you want to add your template the &amp; digi@@ code , simply send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ code ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the base folder in the dialog . select the folder where you copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . the selection of a folder automatically updates the thumb@@ nail of the templates .
below the preview are three buttons with which you can change the zoom factor and position of your image .
enlarge This button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
reduce : this button shr@@ inks the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image lying under the template . to do so , take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adapted automatically to the thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but generates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
blur@@ red mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually it sharp@@ ens not a bit , it works rather psycho@@ visu@@ ell . you can use it to remove atmospheric vap@@ our and it makes a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process can be combined with only minimal differences to one color point . this in turn results in sharp edges a bit blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually require more sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
with JPEG pictures , a camera is often used for internal sharp@@ ness . images in raw format on the other hand must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers use a focus filter already during scanning the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo using the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can use the menu entry to run the Cor@@ rec@@ t Archi@@ pelago .
but you should handle it carefully as the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also enhances the noise . generally , the most useful technique is re@@ focuss@@ ing the tool to shar@@ pen an image . you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen it . use the tool for sof@@ tening with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the Filter Un@@ sharp Mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tested first . an increase in the radius or the amount increases the effect . if you make the blur@@ red mask too strong , noise and the impression of bur@@ rs are created near sharp edges .
the radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should best shar@@ pen pictures in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image that is added to the original . thus the sharp@@ ness of the focus is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference @-@ amount . this allows for a minimum difference to be defined for an edge of the filters . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from shar@@ per and hence beauty errors in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image that ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.@@ 0 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focuses a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted extraction Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to change an image &amp; quot ; re@@ focuss@@ er@@ quot ; in which it revers@@ es the de@@ focus . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ red mask . re@@ focuss@@ ing reaches usually better results than blur@@ red .
in practice , the circular spl@@ itting works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s fold . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source @-@ pix@@ les that are far from the original source pixel . in most cases the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung is affected even very strongly from the distant pixels .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should result in 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very blur@@ red then pay attention to Hei@@ ligen@@ coup@@ ons .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpen@@ ing effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality becomes very bad . a useful value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will even lower the image .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your blur@@ ring is sharp . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the gauge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module is very slow if you select great values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for that purpose . any re@@ focuss@@ ing parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try out all trimm@@ ing , color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before otherwise change the image . the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant arti@@ facts .
when you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; than JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , Un@@ inten@@ tional mas@@ king produces better results than sharp@@ ens . this could be caused by the blur@@ ry mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharp@@ ness .
theore@@ tically , blur@@ red mas@@ king must always produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . practically , the result of the FI@@ R Vienna filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ ring mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focuss@@ ed image :
the original blur@@ red pattern must be corrected . this picture was made with an analogue camera . the un@@ focuss@@ ed result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods for the correction of sharpen@@ ing in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English below this address .
the smooth@@ ness of the pad determines the bl@@ ur of the area that has been dark@@ ened in order to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the color ink allows a modified color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can adjust it here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available default settings are listed below :
if you want to fine tune the filter settings , you can use the tab smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even smooth@@ ness over the image . whereas larger values mainly smooth homogen@@ ous regions and leave details sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should keep details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards .
directional Dep@@ enden@@ cy Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly across all directions while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed only in one direction . if you have a film particle or CCD sounds will produce a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ness above all@@ . p then defines the relative smo@@ othing . therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it gets smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it has to be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : specifies how often the algorithm is passed . usually , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle step width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is chosen small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles generate a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integrated step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never exceed 2 .
using linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the highest quality you get by selecting this option is minimal . it doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to leave it out .
the Save As and Load buttons do exactly that . any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is relatively quick at work . however , it may take a long time to load a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button .
below you can see how image errors are corrected with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is an odd black art@@ ef@@ act caused by a bad film bearing during the voyage . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable picture filters to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts such as dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings dialog can remain with the default settings .
radius monitors the window size from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can blur@@ b the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus smaller errors adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch in front of the filter to detect lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter can no longer obtain image details and noise or lubric@@ ate occurs again .
edges : controlled edge precision for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong it can &apos;t remove the whole noise or noise spi@@ kes can occur . set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark@@ er areas that are typically more strongly depl@@ eted .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of phase j@@ itter . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filtering radius is re@@ acted to variations of lumin@@ ance . when it is raised , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . if it is at its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter can occur at the edges . it can remove noise spi@@ kes and is the recommended method for it .
store under and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all the noise reduction parameters you set can be saved to the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool for sof@@ tening with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo .
the digi@@ tization ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film grain , scratches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that occur in digital , original or retro@@ actively digit@@ alized images . the smo@@ othing takes place along the image contours and thereby preserves the content as it does the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture mapping . the texture mapping is performed with another tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for the restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm he produces some compres@@ sions &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ actor quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save As and Load buttons make exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is relatively quick at work . however , it may take a long time to load a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Stop .
below you can reduce like a photo with uni@@ formity noise reduction .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected one ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures have been reduced to an old ink photograph taken with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by scanner lighting and photo paper . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Hot@@ pixel tool allows for hot@@ pixel photos to be removed with a CCD camera gem , eight . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are copy@@ righ@@ ted by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels &quot; ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ picture sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
upload this file into the dark image wizard . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these will be highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you capture the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the fitting dark image to the image to be corrected . an auto @-@ processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard re@@ members the last dark image and loads it automatically at the next session .
the image area and preview will help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and see the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are moved to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image can be seen under ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ tis@@ ation ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide angle lenses , in particular those in the medium and large photo format , often cannot illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range evenly . instead , &quot; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sh@@ ading ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there .
many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which increases the necessary shutter time in such circumstances that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also use a center filter , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise un@@ sharpen@@ ed effects are caused by movement .
with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s fil@@ ament and colour and film scanner , it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image made without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a center filter to a picture . the algorithm is copy@@ righ@@ ted by John Walker .
with three controls , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three more exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or accidentally a light intensity of 2 . increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree .
fra@@ ming , Con@@ trast , and G@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide you with positive values as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of the exposure of the target image , let the values for luminous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the Color Gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a rec@@ ess and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David H@@ od@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ rical distor@@ tions . color distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second grade treats the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect , but fla@@ un@@ ts at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth grade correc@@ ts the removed ends opposite to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be almost eliminated .
in general : this value controls the thickness of the distortion second degree . negative values can be used to correct tone @-@ shaped distor@@ tions and positive values of cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion part of the image . this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner Par@@ ameters &apos; has the opposite sign of the parameter General .
zoom : this value ren@@ ders the image size new and thus leads to a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive image decreases .
brigh@@ ten : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview will illustrate the distortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start .
the ton@@ n@@ - and cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all trimm@@ ing or size changes . best perform this correction as the first one . if you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a ton @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal guide line . move the mouse cursor in the picture preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important location , such as the se@@ ash@@ ore or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the pitch / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black edges . you can remove them using the trimm@@ ing tool in the Trans@@ form Edit menu from the image editing menu or via the Zoom control of this dialog .
for most pictures , the sound @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some motifs such as shots from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera by hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of a ton @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image can be seen under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method of simul@@ ating inf@@ ra @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible from this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ ra film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can set two parameters to set film bas@@ kets and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the Add Part Film@@ fired option if you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows become white like snow !
since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce the infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs , as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed picture below ( 2 ) to see . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top @-@ lights .
the film gra@@ ding is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool for re@@ producing film grain on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed movies such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver bas@@ ins of the photographic emul@@ sion .
the film gra@@ zing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , road @-@ photographic , gra@@ iny image especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
the controller can calibr@@ ate ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , set to ISO 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film gra@@ ding effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processed the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature images and still lif@@ es are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for large pictures . smooth the smooth@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel wide picture is 1 and G@@ lä@@ tte 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage sketch . the lines that define the outlines in the drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sketch you . this would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controls with a range of values ranging from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the carbon label filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the digi@@ star ; Filter Gra@@ ve shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter Gra@@ ve is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ling landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the depth used is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distor@@ tions . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 , the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Stop .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using bl@@ ur effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Down : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radial blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels around a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
motion blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving z : B : shot from a car or train , camera .
characteristic blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly into the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by means of a random shift of pixels and simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the color basin in the picture and blur@@ ts it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Stop .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm created by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number varies the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the image .
you can hold with the Edit &amp; Edit ; image editing a area free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should stay free . if you start the filter from rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drop filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can put it in the right orientation by mirr@@ oring or rotating . you can find the tools in the menu Trans@@ forming Rot@@ ate or Trans@@ forming mirrors .
infl@@ ating photo is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimum loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into an image when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you recover the missing information or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is to be seen below .
the tool to change the size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to increase a small image with a better quality then try the tool for blowing .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ code ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo blo@@ bubbles was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in tab New Size and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it gets smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it has to be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly to this . each one can be saved as a text file and loaded later .
photo blo@@ bubbles is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Stop .
you can see below an example of photo blo@@ ating by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement for comparison .
the editing of a photo is not only a frequently under@@ estimated operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . to cut a photo you simply have to create the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle as you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . this will give you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by dra@@ gging at the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can be created by simply dra@@ gging it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The C@@ trl button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl + + X ) . use the File Save or File Invent@@ ory entries under the File menu to save the newly edited photo .
in the preview pane , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners using the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be preserved .
in the tool Accor@@ ding to the aspect ratio you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is always assigned .
the tool Accor@@ ding to the aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches , inches or any other physical size . you can for example see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontal or vertical .
at the bottom of the dialog you can use the max. ratio knob to set the area to the maximum possible depending on the selected relation and orientation .
the tool Accor@@ ding to the aspect ratio cuts its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizon@@ tal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the trimm@@ ing tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut picture and not the original image .
the settings of the co@@ hesi@@ on help make it possible to hide help so that you can better put your pictures together . these help are :
harmonious tri@@ angles : harmonious partitions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third gel , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into a similar harmonious tri@@ angles at the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden center : the golden mean is a split of different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is equal to 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden mean . a composition which follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden center provides liqu@@ e@@ fied guides when you put a picture together . these aids are listed below :
the Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third gel , the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s eye along the spiral line and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow along this way .
another rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . these rect@@ angles are used to create the golden spiral . it should give something that the eye is located at the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the golden tri@@ angles are also derived from the gold spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the central points on the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles .
when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect called Dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach otherwise .
the horizontal mirrors and vertical mirr@@ oring options can be used to reflect the harmonious partitions .
with the Color button you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle .
when you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera vertically or horizontally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can repair it with the Edit &amp; Edit , image editing and the tool free rotation .
rotate your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slide again to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right .
for your help the module Free Rotation provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the picture preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a print on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have turned a picture , you will find un@@ desired tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair this is to use the function Trans@@ forming C@@ utting out of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the Automati@@ cally C@@ utting function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after rotation . note however the above warning .
all perspective trans@@ formations are carried out around a fixed point to the so @-@ called point of reference . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
corner at the top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle Right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the picture is slightly s@@ me@@ ared . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments produce a double effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adjusted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the image with trans@@ form@@ er trimm@@ ing from the image processing .
the sh@@ oring tool is used to move part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . for example , horizontal sh@@ ear@@ ing will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not a rotation , the image is distorted into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
turn your picture by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the preview pane .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line is displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sh@@ ading tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture is blur@@ red a bit . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two sh@@ ments producing twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image has un@@ attractive tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with trans@@ formations from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ code ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed .
due to this dependen@@ cy on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all the file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF underneath .
&amp; digi@@ code ; displays only files in formats that know . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of this with a predefined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ plug ; the file in image editing will change . you can change this list of file extensions that &amp; digi@@ code . please refer to the Configuration section for more information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select even the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found on Wikipedia .
image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG on the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also store loss@@ less if specified in the settings .
if you want to know more about the raw image format , you can read very helpful instructions in English under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ plug ; see the Configuration section for more information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ master ; .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; supports downloading raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ pack . with this , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all supported cameras can be viewed at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ com ; :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ plug ; is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in options to display or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ plug ; the &amp; k@@ de ; use settings to play movies to start the program for playback .

K@@ IP@@ I module exports a series of images into a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Google Earth .
if you change steps 4 and 5 , which you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustment with the white balance module .
many tools you need to edit the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ p@@ sed ; contain your description here .
all image processing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , soft marks , noise suppression , re@@ focusing , blur@@ ry , etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applied &amp; quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current image . links from it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ licate . the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
the upper part shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper part shows the original and the lower one to compare the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can turn on to display over and lower exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview . previ@@ ewing in the left part of the dialog will be updated right away .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the ability to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the properties tab displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it and move it . move C@@ trl ; left mouse button to drag a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and using colors .
the pal@@ ettes files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can apply either to the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are located in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot Custom color and last used colors .
in the Load Group dialog , you can select from a list of installed pal@@ ettes or browse the folders by files .
the cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described under the pallet view . here also the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box With the cursor under the button color is enabled , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write has been selected . this mode you can set by selecting the check box over@@ write under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor .
a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the Copy , Cut and Pa@@ ste actions .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; use the following format for clip@@ board data : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a new@@ line character if another color follows . if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , these can be past@@ ed as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit .
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color selection on the left .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are used free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . previously , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; programs that include &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; Project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; at . it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; the graph re@@ counts and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ er ; )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; k@@ ate ; to open or to open the graphs in &amp; k@@ graph@@ er ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component
load large graphs ( currently there are problems starting from around 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to represent more than these knots )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs .
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in a separate sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list contains last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog box .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen@@ shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt keys ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file currently loaded in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; loaded file has been changed from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether to rel@@ o@@ ad the graph or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; can also remember your decision , so you can change your decision later . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item Settings c@@ graph@@ er ; set up ... see also .
if you open a graph file outside of a running &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance , or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it using the setup dialog .
at the start of the program , you can open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how to split the graph to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
if you are using multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page will be adjusted to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled in by the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with a graph@@ ene distributed on several pages without header and with another font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut store page gives you the option to set the behavior when a file has been changed to the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or the program promp@@ ts for each time .
the Open page gives the ability to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ er ; specify when a graph is opened outside of a current session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the current session ) or determine that every time a graph is asked .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked at every start .
the context menu that usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ N window opens up more options :
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z and layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are :
the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for inde@@ xed graph@@ ene . it produces accounts according to the boun@@ ce spring model . it uses the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm , which is equivalent to statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm generates a spring @-@ spring model for un@@ executed graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man pure gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ lat@@ ch for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ ene .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the nodes circle @-@ shaped according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for specific diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is then executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph file as a parameter , and print the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can specify &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
specifies the type of graph ( directed or executed ) and applies the default algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for executed graphs ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
shows the What is the mouse poin@@ ter . with this mouse @-@ cursor click a &amp; GUI ; element to get more help to this item ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source repository &apos;s base folder .

the K@@ IP@@ I module provides tools to read and save new images and save them .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . at the moment , two sources can be used :
scan pictures : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the san@@ e project or another source such as video streams . for this to work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu item , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select here the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears in that you can replace the default duc@@ r@@ he own to select your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image with the button . the estimated file size will be shown in the right , lower corner .
make sure that the window is displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pressed the Scan button you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window for setting the target image appears . here , you can specify the compression and the type of image file . please remember that the BM@@ P type is not compressed and therefore very large files created . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; or create it by saving the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after selecting the Import &gt; screen shot in the menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete work area to read a single window under the mouse .
if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ station . if you have picked up the complete work area , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen@@ shot will wait before it starts . if you have to switch to other work areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog will display options for the target image with the options described above .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . Fli@@ ck@@ r makes it possible to send his photos to people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world , place the photos of your camera phone online and show your photos securely and privately to your friends and family around the world .
the Export to Fli@@ ck@@ r module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of creating a token . it is used for your authentication so it is virtually your identification to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started to allow you to login with Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after the successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r web page . you will be presented the following page after a successful registration .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the module exports to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you are greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current access permissions that indicates the module . for upload , you need write permissions . the module does not currently support other permissions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions .
the button Add Photos should be pressed once you have set all other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . when you press the O@@ k button , you start up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r server .
the Tags field can be filled with a comm@@ a @-@ separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during upload .
with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie options , you can set the permissions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you choose the Change option to change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export is a tool for ex@@ porting your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export now has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I geographic loc@@ alization module provides tools to locate pictures ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and l@@ atitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data , you need a GPS track as XML file in the g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical Loc@@ alization Cor@@ relation . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the above looking dialog appears then . to load a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . this file of course contains data recorded at the same locations as the pictures of your camera .
when the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed that indicates the coordinates in red . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera connection must be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera zone here .
the setting for the maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS @-@ time and the camera level . if the deviation from it is merged , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have track data from one location for images , you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching data . if you know that in reality there is a location in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same location . since the dialog boxes the coordinates from one call to the next you just have to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . to do so , select the region in question and increase si@@ e.@@ Per@@ form this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the card can be changed manually between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a pile of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Photo Gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to allow for the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . the albums are not shown hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ see and the text will appear in the header of the HTML page .
the tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . the option For each picture one page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ Show
the Ri@@ der album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ X@@ HTML , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG image format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images .
with Other color depth , you can change the default color depth , which naturally also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the rider thumb@@ nail allows you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
when the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during creation . the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing pictures .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and to perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for a fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size is rising , because no compression of the color information takes place . this can be found e.g. also with PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Digital Camera Client is a tool for connecting your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor now has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image . the data will be copied after you have pressed the button OK .
this function does not work for all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write in any target format . JPEG is supported in writing . please check out exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ zer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ l and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can add a basic image transfer between the individual images . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . after that , you can create the module via Tools MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images you have selected are then listed in the portfolio under image files . there you can also change sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your schedule , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high , very smooth picture change .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave it black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the m@@ peg output file .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have all adjusted your preferences , you can start generating the movie with the button coding . depending on the speed of your computer you can now go to enjoy a coffee quickly or in all rest and enjoy the slide show if you are back .
if an indication appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the jp@@ eg@@ s and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages using the button Settings right below .
the Print Wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing gi@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct print@@ out .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the raw file to convert and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings for the white balance should be used . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected for you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
as soon as you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the tagged image format , TIFF , keeps all information in your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you intend to process your images often or otherwise use them later , you should not select the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteri@@ or@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG File in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process , you can use Cancel .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing in a single image , which is the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing files . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or enlarge the image . to do this , four types of image change are provided :
propor@@ tionally ( 1 dim . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
propor@@ tionally ( 2 dim . ) : resi@@ zing in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . for example , you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen size .
not Pro@@ por@@ tional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
press preparation : prepare the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred email program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the image window will be shown with the images you selected . click the Add Images button to add more images with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image a preview will be shown on the right .
you can also drag and drop images to the image list to add them to the list of images to be sent .
with the button to remove images , the selected images are removed from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images you can use the OK button to open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you have selected are already attached as attachments .
most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations on the size of e @-@ mails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the email window will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be saved and used every time you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you are using the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments will be added to the images in a text file and added to the email .
the PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in JPEG image format and the original files in JPEG format , then the original copy data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages , in search of errors . however , your email program will automatically start at the end . by closing the button you can close this window .
after starting the Advanced Sli@@ deshow window , a window will appear with questions about how you want to display your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ transitions option in the presentation will use very elegant image transitions with Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the Show File name option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images is displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop . you can then reset it manually with Es@@ c ; Cancel .
the option to select images random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used in the order of the images in the album .
the time distance between the images can be set between the pictures . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should test it before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random@@ ly , each transition between the images sel@@ ects a different effect .
during the slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on .
with this toolbar you can pause and start the presentation , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slideshow .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the desktop .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
as soon as you have your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can browse with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; Browse through them , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , are now available in each group , thus in persons , places and in the group keyword ( s ) .
in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have entered your images and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and , of course , view the current thumb@@ nails .
when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see the picture .
when you select another person you will only see the images on which both persons are to be seen . by using this method you can restrict the number of displayed images from a few thousand images to a few images .
if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view images of your area with thumb@@ nails .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , that is of course also valid for places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture .
to display images next to the names , select the button located on the right of the toolbar . in the appearing context menu you can select which view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can display e.g. icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
however , you must select which image to display for each individual person . to do this , you need to open the image view window ( described in more detail ) and select the image for the respective person in the context menu . here you can customize the image for the respective person . in the View window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and choose which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you access the Find dialog in the main window , you will see a dialog which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can preview this dialog once again .
if you enter a string in the lab@@ eling or description field , the cap@@ tions and descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you would like , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total file , e.g. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images by specific names as you can see in the picture . here we see images on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :

start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . after that , some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out .
if you prefer to print out this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you can see here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10 minutes .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed items Pre@@ view View from the database ( when you select a date , you will see the first image of this date in the preview pane ) and also the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview window .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and dra@@ gging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select a range , you will only preview images of this time in the preview window . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two ways to create HTML websites with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) . the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version , which you can create through the menu file HTML ... .
before HTML pages are created , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more precisely .
first enter the title of the overview and a description that the HTML file should contain later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created that is visible on the overview page .
finally , you can select which information to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed , which are obvious to the viewer as well . for example , that all images are from a party . note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; currently all images are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why not specifically addressed to them .
on the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images . this means those who watch your website and have a monitor supporting the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 will not download any more images that have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 for example .
the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have set . so it can browse your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transfer time . if he wants to get an image larger , he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
best choose a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , you need to select the main folder where all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and added automatically next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if they are really all visible to the viewer . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created will be started . the URL you set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files you created are not yet in the final destination folder , you have to manually copy them there . to ensure the import function , see , correctly you have to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are located .
all three settings are related to the base folders and URLs . this creates a sub@@ folder whose name will be set to the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have spent a lot of time applying the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not do again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a short@@ cut to pictures . the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the pictures together and that file can be passed so independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File Export menu ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , then the images of the URL you have created when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
the following describes the dialog for ex@@ porting images that you can access through the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available :
with the option to copy manually to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally Copy to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are regular zip files . since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you still want this , simply select the Export File option .
the last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size , because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File File menu ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; import the exported database as described in .
the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder to import images to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category people of the file to import ( if you are a domain ) while this category is named in your database . therefore , in the third dialog you will be asked which categories of the file to import are to be imported and which categories they correspond to in your database .
in the fourth step , you can synchron@@ ize the categories of the file to import with the categories of your current database . an example for this can be seen in the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups . if you look for example pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is shown .
in this manual , you will go through the various steps from ( 1 ) to set the information about your images , ( 2 ) searching and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your images . however , it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . at many places in this manual it is talked about pictures , but frequently it also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of its images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a floppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder where your images are stored and uses it automatically at future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so you can start a different folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual the various settings are explained .
on the left you can see six different icons , with which you can access settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which you can access by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
it describes how you can define different properties for each picture , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups , such as objects , animals or albums .
click on the dialog which is used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the Options section , sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up all member groups , i.e. all members of a group at one time in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in .
in the left @-@ hand side of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window you will find a list of the current category and the list of sub @-@ categories in the right .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; divi@@ des its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface .
the modules can be called via the menu module . the modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
since the modules are shared by several applications together , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using these on your own pictures . demo database can be run either via the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu .
the applications that the modules use via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not working . this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications can arrange their images in albums : an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order by albums for some modules , so you can use the features with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view , so all images that show you the picture preview right now .
besides the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry in this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album will do so , so if you have selected people to view it and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select the modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and toolbar at the top . under the toolbar you will see the window with which you have not entered your image database . currently , there are not very many information , since you do not yet have any information about your pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons depicted in the image , etc . you can set each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . if , for example , is shown on all pictures Jes@@ per and all images recorded in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
in view , you will see three lists with a text box where you can define people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images .
the following idea is based on moving the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can , because the names used are moved up , find and classi@@ fy the persons faster .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sorting symbol by date on the list .
if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected images and add these images with notes . in this case simply click on the thumb@@ nails and back buttons that are located at the top right of the picture .
if you have recorded several images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California .
the image shows a browser window that shows the USA as an overlay . to show you that it is an overlay , a special icon is displayed .
in the context menu of the Comment dialog is it possible to add an entry to an existing or new revision or sub@@ category . additionally , you can simply drag an entry to a category and place it there in order to sort it into a sub@@ category of this item . attention , this assumes you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that form the top edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by moving it outside the window area .
if you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button , which gives you the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then select / hide windows . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the images in the browser you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images if you have not set filters . an example for this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the picture viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the preview screen . simply select the respective images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Del@@ ete the Edit menu from the Edit menu . now the window that you can see in the picture will be displayed .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely , images can also be used without you stored on your hard drive . of course you need to have the pictures stored somewhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper corner is truncated are not stored on the hard drive . for example , the thumb@@ nails are available for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can preview these images , however , you can &apos;t view these images with the picture viewer .
as you can see , this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back to . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not support it until now . if you want to avoid h@@ ass@@ le of how to mess up your pictures , please buy a larger hard drive to save all images on it .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you filter the images so that at the end those who want to make you un@@ appro@@ achable and click Ac@@ tual View in the menu Privacy . alternatively , you can also select all pictures that your little sister may see , navigate and lock the menu item Any@@ thing out of the current view .
with this you have defined which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures , so that all images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the pictures displayed again , click on lock .
it is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe . on the one hand , all images on the hard drive and on the other can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection only serves to rep@@ el those who are familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar .
the reason why you manage all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and describe hours for hours with it is natural that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with a picture _ and video viewer . this you can start from preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . of course he shows the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter via the picture , such as who is in the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the info@@ box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and disc@@ ard somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information can be displayed at all . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer .
some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser will display suitable entries to this . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by jumping the buttons on the image high and down . you can jump to the first and last image with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it can load a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can enter the image in and out . to zoom in , you can simply pull a rect@@ angle with the mouse . the plus button zo@@ oms in the middle of the image with the minus key . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the dot button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not shown zo@@ omed . with the Sync button sets the zoom , so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key .
you can rotate the image using the turn functions from the context menu . this does not work for videos . you can make comments to the current image using the menu item Comment from the context menu .
when you look at images it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can view it and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . you will probably prefer to select only the image and see more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to add pictures with features while viewing them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letter . in the picture you will see a picture in which the characters A , B and C are set .
once you have identified features on your images , they are available to you in the browser . so , if you want to print , print or whatever images you have selected , simply add them all at once with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this is described in . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be viewed in the preview view . if you can display categories in the In@@ dre view view , you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the letter for the attribute after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you can get your photo album ; painting on the picture .
the mixture is not stored with the image , but in the database . in the way you can reverse your painted later .
in order to turn off the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; turn on the image from the context menu . to end the painting press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; work , you must have the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully profi@@ cient , but documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; be sure to read and understand .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views are shown in yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an object that is already selected , as all sub@@ projects are already selected with the object .
in order to insert a new object into the object tree , select the location where you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu appears to allow you to choose the correct position :
delete selected objects from the scene using either the Edit menu or the right mouse button context menu .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to take these changes . if you entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with a fault description . then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or reject the changes with Cancel .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
click thumb@@ nail in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the chosen texture . as default the entire texture will be rendered even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check out locally .
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level selected in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window ordering as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it at will . you can also save several window arrangements and easily switch between different orders .
to anchor a window above or below a present view , drag the beginning stream to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view . the new view then is anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views of one another , drag the beginner in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the tabs at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to remove a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the prot@@ ector on the desktop or click the small arrow pointing upwards in the front bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the front bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can fix them in any position .
the current window view can be saved with view window arrangement ... it displays a dialog where you can save the window ordering under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . when this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 does not support .
to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering icon on the Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar or select the menu item View vig@@ nette .
a render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar , or select R@@ ender modes in the View menu ... the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but meaningful is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
in the box size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image section to render into the input fields .
in the Com@@ bin@@ ation field Quality you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection light . a detailed description of render properties can be found in the user manual of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
when a picture is rendered with just one ray per pixel several errors can arise . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are less than a pixel in the representation . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this feature look better .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than a ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . the second method is adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive ; the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is repeatedly spl@@ itted and adapted because recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels will be calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a lat@@ tice of 4 x 5 ( 25 ) will compu@@ te additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel .
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually followed and tested for further sub@@ divisions . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you enable it@@ tering , changed &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays are a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature .
this tab allows you to specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding beams have not hit any object .
opens a new window for viewing the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; select the Import File menu item ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full scope of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste into &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene is rendered . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version . supported are the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object of the points to the grid in the contex@@ tual menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the sphere , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you cross high detailed fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an advanced projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approxim@@ ation to the projections , but requires more time for rendering .
when you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is displayed in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
when you tick the floor , a bottom is rendered under the objects . the floor is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
if you tick the edge smo@@ othing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used to render the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . more precise information about the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender modes section .
on this page you can modify existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in the section window orders , explains how to create and save window arrangements .
the default window arrangement : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
the Exist@@ ing window orders list shows all existing window arrangements . a new arrangement allows you to create with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Remove .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name displays all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created with the Add button and Del@@ ete selected views with the button Remove .
the position of the new window . with new column you create a new column on the right of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with card card you will receive a map card view together with the previous view and floating anch@@ ored the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without any more precise knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you are using a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to render , as a result you get a black image .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black image .
if you have installed everything without errors , you can see the first start of window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing icons of the toolbar . read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you &apos;ll often have to use these menus and symbols , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . mark the scene and then select the menu item Edit Del@@ ete . with this you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create . in particular , you will notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; see further details .
do not change anything at the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points in the view that you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
when you press the Apply button or the Enter key , the wire model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the perspective of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you might , for example , insert a cad@@ re ( insert the final mind bo@@ b@@ bin ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method of solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite layer as a floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also displays the level , al@@ beit at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite layer . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can un@@ fold the entry for the ground if you click on the + in front of the object . in this case , you will see only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to the drill a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment .
in both cases a dialog opens in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( Name = bottom pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pigment only shows a matt black material because you have to re @-@ enter settings for the pigment . now always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the header and the ball in the preview , click on the Apply button and then click on the preview button .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you expected . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
each time , select one color in the object tree and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already be able to execute this step , since you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easy as the floor :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the input key or the button Apply ) , so the ball will float above the floor as you have moved the floor down one unit down .
of course , rendering now gives a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , set a suitable material .
if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the floor , give the ball a pigment as color :
select First sub@@ property and change the name for example in Sphere Pig@@ ment . click on ball Pig@@ ment , then select one color and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finishing properties :
then change the values as in the screen@@ shots below and click Apply or press the Enter key .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already give partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces even if Met@@ alli@@ c : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what options are offered to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ sourcing is a render method to create a two dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model .
if you are ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer shooting hypo@@ the@@ tical beams from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog have an effect .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you also don &apos;t see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you created previously with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved saved changes in the scene .
repeat the recently revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing und@@ o .
stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new order or over@@ write an existing layout .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the appearance , short@@ cuts and default behavior .
opens a dialog to change key short@@ cuts . you can use this option to change default short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can use this option to add and remove tool icons for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
a pump @-@ map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a texture map .
basic objects are simple geometric shapes that can be used as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this base body . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by using an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that can be displayed by clicking on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the Return key .
you can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog box &amp; ball show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can set the way of working &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; in the other two , short instructions for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for each window can be specified .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is activated , load &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; already the next image in the folder while you still have a look at the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slide show .
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; when closing the name of the recently opened folder . at the next launch open &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used in to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background will also be filled with the selected color .
you can set up &amp; ball show ; set up only some of the file types that can display the program as well .
with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
specify whether the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 1 .
change the keyboard short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; shor@@ ts for the display window and short commands for the browser in the index cards .
with this option , you can switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in one window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
reduce the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open .
show the picture in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the digi@@ pack ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the digi@@ pack ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image editing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform corrections and modifications .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means that the user is contributing his part to at least reporting problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ photo ; make it as simple as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains an entry Reports you problems or requests . this displays a dialog with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page to report problems and requests . all required information is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; then we would like to ask you questions to other users of &amp; show@@ foto . however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . guide to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; try to give you so much control over his work procedures as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ foto . to access these settings , you need to set up the show@@ foto . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator has been selected . skill@@ wise , the colors should be in contrast with what you want to view . sub @-@ exposure should show a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side bar at the right edge , providing you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same side@@ bar in the image processing . you can view them by clicking on one of the five tabs :
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes images scan and save images .
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer makes them scan and save images . &amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite ; can open for each image a dialog to save or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support at the SA@@ NE project page by typing the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite command line ; using the command sc@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog to select the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel &amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
in order to scan an image , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
in order to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . he can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the entire preview fits into the window .
when the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if before saving a preview is selected in the settings , then the image will be displayed in a preview window as seen below . when saving is pressed the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en will lead to a demoli@@ tion and you will return to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the kind as &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; images stored . dialog to Save for each image opens the dialog before each scanned image . if &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; this will automatically save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a file name .
this setting defines where the images are saved with the option Save without asking a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as the default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this by clicking the button ...
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the images automatically to be stored and is the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored image will get a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can customize the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t will be used .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE @-@ Help with the &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ Manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE About dialog for &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; output .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other programs keyboard short@@ cuts . below you will find a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global short@@ cut keys can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and selecting global short@@ cuts . selecting with the right mouse button in the player window and set short commands ... select .
you may set up any existing multimedia buttons in such a way that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; shor@@ ts will make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists browsers and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de command line options ; in addition , Amar@@ ok also has some command line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script to see if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog so that the user knows why a script does not run .
begin with require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error 0 = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and ste@@ er Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be included in every K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . this usually uses the function ex@@ ec ( ) . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure The script to show the setup dialog . to store and store the setup data , each script needs to take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok will set the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change signals that a new piece is being played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; use D@@ CO@@ P functions to query further information about the new piece ( for example , the metadata or the piece length ) .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume Sign@@ alizes a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ization : Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le Device Sets the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le can be used to add the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user termin@@ ates a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M signal to the script . this signal should be processed to do e. g. saving data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user and z@@ b have downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name , such as mein@@ skri@@ p@@ t.@@ cat@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 , so that the user can clearly see the archive as the Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the er@@ asing cat@@ amar@@ an script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the other modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to preserve the file permissions :
if your script package is ready , you can re@@ charge it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and app@@ end the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , rather than having to work through endless menus . you may also search for a very specific title for thousands of items in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search , you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists but can never decide what you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is the right one for you . and if you still find it hard , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right thing to re@@ discover your music !
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not have any trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
certain dependen@@ cies need to be met for some of the compile options so that they can be used . details can be found in the System Requirements section .
activates Deb@@ ug@@ ging Symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards for setting up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
to display player windows , the player window will be added to the playlist in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed ( Ju@@ K ) .
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ b@@ able . the option turns on the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
atmospheric design : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ b@@ able . this modi@@ fies the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer .
storing voice files in music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ b@@ able . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the &amp; Amar@@ ok settings folder ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok will be launched when a browser is required .
other browsers are using : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
save the playlist at the end of the playlist , automatically saves the current playlist by moving &amp; Amar@@ ok ; check this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when moving .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok will use relative paths to the music files starting from the location of the playlist . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files will be stored .
keep up @-@ to @-@ date pieces when changing the play that causes the playlist to open / un@@ roll to keep the current piece in the visible window area .
when changing parts to the context browser , it automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is all@@ u@@ ded .
in the App@@ ear@@ ance section , you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the fonts section you can set the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by using proprietary fonts the otherwise gray displayed section is enabled . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows and context browsers . click Select ... so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the Sel@@ ection of Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . to do so , use the color sel@@ ector activated for foreground and background color .
re@@ play at startup causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , the play automatically continues with the piece at the place with which it was stopped at the last stop .
setting up the on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is labeled , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
use your own colors to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the colour surfaces opens the dialog for selecting colors . if your own colors are not activated , the default colors will be used .
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below is a list of available space holders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can specify which screen to display the O@@ SD in a multi @-@ monitor environment .
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector . some drivers still activate more settings in this card card .
the collection card collection is used to set up all the settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
here you can select the folder that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders .
recur@@ sively browse sub@@ folders : this means that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the selected and their sub@@ folders will search for music .
monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok to monitor the selected folders to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . besides , an incre@@ mental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import Play@@ lists : causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; adding all found play@@ lists to your collection files ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the playlist browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the Com@@ bin@@ ation field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , another device is needed in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section will be used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok . on Calcul@@ ator : will enter the machine on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . afterwards , the network port is entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
username : and password : to enter the data required to connect to the database .
the debit card last@@ .@@ f@@ m establishes the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and if necessary create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and so update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transfer the names of played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
access similar performers : after activating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok will get a list of similar performers to the played piece . note : you can view the list in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and no further K@@ DE packages . so you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minim@@ ally .
some features such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager will keep the relevant standards from fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , for example , but flu@@ x@@ box will help for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can locate the file by looking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and let the collection be recre@@ ated .
most of the time , this is due to the fact that tag@@ li@@ b falls from this file when reading the met@@ a @-@ information . please report these errors to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . the support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is somewhat mat@@ ured .
make sure that all libraries from &amp; Amar@@ ok were compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok , compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to cras@@ hes while editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable autom@@ . switch off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use at least one value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the email will automatically open for a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ Infos , but do not mark it as Uni@@ code . the following per@@ l script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the file $ AR@@ GV ( 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the Status bar ( Rand@@ om Mode / Rep@@ eti@@ tion / Dynamic Play@@ list ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the icon effects will be removed . note that in some cases , one has to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows their effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ system@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , please check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
most of the installation problems are easiest due to the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help from other users or developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the # Amar@@ ok channel .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please insert only one error , if you have something about fixing a bug in Amar@@ ok yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the start of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amar@@ ok &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a blank playlist appears . how do music pieces come into it ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start sub@@ window was converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under Tools &apos;s Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column . click anywhere in the new evaluation column to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From Play@@ list Remove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with your mouse into the playlist and drop it there , just like you would do it with other files . it &apos;s as simple as that : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , right next to the Add button , the Play@@ list button can be saved . click on it .
probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is missing . install the package x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ ell@@ audio@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! yes , this really is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses an approach independent from the back@@ end , therefore the actual question must be What media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support almost every imagin@@ able audio format .
it may ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 decoder will be supplied ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , Enter key
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you are using the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously generate audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you in the search for the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to provide a different sink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
that does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . you can not simply send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would just want a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
either use the G@@ Stre@@ amer Driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next item of the FAQ ! ) . make sure the wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause distorted playback . read this error report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help you well .
either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or just install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been heavily optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less dre@@ d@@ les react the visu@@ ali@@ zations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cras@@ hes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you will need to register all the components . run the log tabs to record all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download the m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run the m@@ peg file , once as system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with the @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again .
if you have a complete list of suggestions / requests , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . in addition , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run this command with the alarm command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before going to bed , then you are awak@@ ened by the soft sounds of music that you have stopped before going to bed .
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles if you are on another computer ?
if there is a working SSH environment , you can proceed as follows . this command will give you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace the IP address with your IP and your user name with your user name . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ ali@@ zations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size .
the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button puts a piece in the click sequence into the queue . pressing the Enter key after searching in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky features , but how does the icon in the system section of the control bar look like ?
click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers you want to display .
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is located on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and there are many error messages appearing on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click Play Audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading change into the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , you will instead take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , and &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ;
basically this adju@@ sts the previous rating with a decreasing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result .
you can add the rating for a piece by clicking on a column heading in the playlist window . then you can change the rating of a piece just like all other attributes , namely by clicking the right mouse button on the piece and editing : select or Edit F2 . you can also edit the rating in the Metad@@ ata dialog .
the developers don &apos;t want you to tell you when you want to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a specified release schedule that is not compatible with the short @-@ term set of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon when playing animated in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Settings Tool@@ bars ... and select the changes you want .
download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... App@@ ear@@ ance context browser design , click on New Design Inst@@ all ....
the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid any difficulties it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or &apos;s navigation range allows you to monitor and monitor &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing in Kon@@ quer@@ or . start kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click the button Settings ( top ) and select the Amar@@ ok pop @-@ down menu .
audio c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free of charge and you only need a free username and a password . audio c@@ rob@@ bler will be fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of cras@@ hes and therefore also caused a lot of bug reports .
probably , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to re@@ configure and install Amar@@ ok .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; newly installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
you probably need to install a distribution that will install the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , you will need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you will need to re@@ compile and install Linux .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ shr@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : don &apos;t use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer fa@@ ad is installed .

you get the error of There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and run it as System Administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how to use the second sound card with Amar@@ ok ?
set up the Amar@@ ok settings ... add the audio output to the device . typical is , for example , h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 &lt; type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; c@@ tl@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 } c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter us@@ b @-@ audio in the setup dialog of x@@ ine and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the tick on sound card support m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not supported any further . you may , of course , like to take this problem yourself into your hand ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed supervis@@ or for Arts : )
listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard that will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok . if you want to update your collection later , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this Quick Start Guide will help you . with their help you will have installed &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very simple . drag entries from the collection browser to the playlist . the small text field for filtering the collection facilitates you searching for certain pieces . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save it by saving play@@ lists at the click of a button . you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the option to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . with a right click on a playlist , you will get different ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , please select Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and then press the play button .
the audio CD function uses the protocol audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning feature is also available in the playlist . simply click with the right mouse button on an entry and follow the burning menu . you have here various possibilities for burning a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed that make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more enjoyable .
if you install these packages through a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player , also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . additionally , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all others .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window there is a scroll bar displaying the currently running piece or the current stream . directly below is the area , the game time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . a click on this area changes the display of the currently expi@@ red play time for the remaining play time of the piece .
the Player window also includes a selection of audio analy@@ zers , even under the balance display . you can switch by the available Analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will be displayed in an independent , magni@@ fiable window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons also feature the PL and E@@ Q buttons . the PL button activates or de@@ activates the Play@@ list window while the E@@ Q button is used to set up E@@ quali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of playback buttons , the volume control and the play position sli@@ der . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the play position or volume . playback buttons allow you to start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own preferences .
to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the Main Menu or click the E@@ Q button in the Player window . once you mark the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok playlist ; is the most widely developed playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that don &apos;t exist in any other player . but don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the abundance of features , they &apos;re all easy to use .
the playlist window can be split into two main areas , on the left is the navigation . in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right there is the playlist itself .
the context browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpreter . these three sub@@ windows will later be explained in detail .
if you have previously used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may notice that the sub@@ window has dropped off . the information displayed there has now been distributed in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . additionally , the information can be viewed in the Statistics window ( Extras statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to em@@ ulate the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find more information about the current piece . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to display cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ n@@ g are supported . the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded Parts , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on any of these pieces , it will be played instantly .
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this interpreter . this section displays the top five highest rated pieces of the current performer .
you can set which information to display in the music sub@@ window . to do so , right click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all tracks in the individual fields to start playback right away . you can also right @-@ click on it and then select one of the options for adding the play or album to the playlist right from the context menu .
in the sub@@ window text the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using the scripts themselves . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , &amp; Amar@@ ok will try to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is yet running , you can choose which one to start .
the Edit button enables you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Find button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Artist - only groups the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres will be dis@@ regarded .
group@@ ing Artist / Album - First the pieces will be sorted by interpreter and among them will be another distribution according to the respective album . if you want to see compil@@ ations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under various performers .
group@@ ing Artist / Year - Album - S@@ ort by interpreter and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest ones first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is used .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically among each other . the artist will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / artist - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them by artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album under the artist .
with the help of the remaining buttons you can customize and combine group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re@@ app@@ end your collection as soon as you change something on the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while .
a search filter is located directly under the toolbar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . instructions for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter you find a selection box , with which you can filter the last added pieces to your collection . you can choose different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours up to one year . furthermore , you can also select your complete collection , which will enable the filter to be switched off practically .
clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser will give you the following options .
load - This will insert the current playlist and insert the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
app@@ end to Play@@ list - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry you will get the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will make you play next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you are asked for a name under which the list is to be stored .
transfer the pieces to the media player to the media player . for more details , see the Media Player browser section for more details .
burn all pieces of this interpreter / Burn to CD - This means that the selected pieces will be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed .
edit Metad@@ ata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) Move files to the garbage bin ... - open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm it , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears in various performers .
pick up a compilation - change a record marked as a compilation album back into a normal album . after that the album will no longer be shown under various performers , but again under the corresponding interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser is easy to handle with lots of play@@ lists , including smart play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists are also possible . click Add smart playlist to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window Media Player is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using your portable media player ( eg iPod ) . in order to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok , for example , it must be mounted in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by interpreter in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired tracks from the playlist and drop them onto the list Artist . if you &apos;re done , click Apply . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . if the transmission is complete , exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and release the drive connection for your iPod .
under the toolbar you find a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar where you can fetch music from a given URL . for example , if you type tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press Enter key , you can access music in the file musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the app@@ ending of files can be difficult by simply dropping the Shift key . in this case , the holding down of the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply dra@@ gging the entries with the mouse to the desired location and dropping . over the playlist is a text field in which you can enter a filter . once you enter letters , just press the pieces that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the reset button until the text box is empty again .
when you enter del@@ im@@ ited search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok will search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one in two , the search will find all the entries containing one , two and three .
when you enter the OR , search for entries containing either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example will find all the pieces containing one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , please en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that Mike Old@@ field contain , but not according to entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a certain search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a certain search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something is looking for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variants as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this is looking for all the pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field OR a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath .
you can set the order sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ trl key , and then clicking with the right mouse button in the desired sequence on the entries . the entries will then be marked with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist .
next , the buttons will follow und@@ o and restore . this allows you to und@@ o or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the toolbar there is a unique , exten@@ dable Analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you get in the player window via the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more buttons available for the toolbar , for example , playback control and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on menu and selecting tool@@ bars .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play time of all the pieces . in addition , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval , a sli@@ der for the playback position and the playing time of the current piece is displayed . the status for random mode and retri@@ eval can be easily changed by double clicking the corresponding display area with the mouse .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar option in the general settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist .
click on this entry to open the Visu@@ alization plug @-@ in window . there you can select the visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry you can find a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can launch it by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left .
from the View menu you can choose what to display in the cover administration . choose from :
the queue management received your big move into &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , the playlist will appear a number next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the plays will play : 1 will play first , 2 as second , and so on .
when you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are pre @-@ specified ( the details for setting up these later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds other random pieces while playing .
adds pieces based on load .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you do not need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
double click on the playlist you want , drag it to the playlist window or right @-@ click on it and then select Load . this way , your current playlist is replaced by the new . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix immediately fill your playlist and you can add playback directly . the Play@@ list Recommen@@ ded pieces will be added to your collection at least once . the recommended pieces will be added at the next piece change , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point . the dynamic mode can also be disabled via the same menu entry .
the New button fills the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit the playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . as a result , the dialog opens to edit the settings of the playlist .
enter any name for the playlist here , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continuously grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will not listen to dup@@ lic@@ ates in this playlist . if the setting is active , the played pieces will be removed while resp@@ ecting the settings .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces were recently played .
this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will continuously grow , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right are already described in the previous section . on the left of the dialog you can select already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random plays from each of the play@@ lists you have cli@@ cked .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on Set@@ ting .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts using a script . it will open a selection dialog , in which a script package for installation can be selected . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you do not want to use a script longer , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to be deleted and then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information to write your own scripts , please refer to the section Writ@@ ing Script .
the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ in is used to activate the available visu@@ ali@@ zations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this quick guide will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps , you need to create an audio CD . to understand the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats then remember that when encoding to MP3 you will receive a worse quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created by a los@@ sy format .
in this dialog box you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has finished the burning process .
this quick guide will show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps , you must have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , Copy CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; settings , please press the Start button . you now see a dialog box that looks like this :
in this dialog box you can track the progress of the copy process . once the original image is read into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium where the data is to be burned .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; Burn the image file . you have to wait until the overall progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; Burn the image file . you have to wait until the overall progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T Designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the Wid@@ get modules . to fix this problem , start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / k@@ de@@ 3 / plug@@ ins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS by your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org . there you will receive the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback there , fall back on community assistance from the forums and get news .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you will need at least one k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in one run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the features that also contains &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; therefore , choose &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatic &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality with burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the Internet , such programs are generally referred to as ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding technology and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and encoder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well @-@ developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ MPEG , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : additional libraries for the processing of various audio formats . with FF@@ MPEG , for example , it is possible to dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : an auxiliary program that can convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ x Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful e.g. for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without Norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the im@@ perfect effect that the music pieces play differently lou@@ dly .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to be able to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . clicking on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
saves the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed by which you can choose folders and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call file saving for each project file .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not saved yet , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
closes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each un@@ saved project , what should happen , just as if you were called for each project file C@@ lose .
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project , you will be asked what to do with it , as if you had called file C@@ lose .
when you access this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . it has the same effect as if you drag the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button Burn , which causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . burning dialogue can only be opened when the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described by what is ? -@@ help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you create files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data from the previous session will always be included , even if this feature is not used .
this function only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
this opens the CD @-@ Cop@@ ying dialog . this also allows you to copy a CD onto another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a CD which you can then burn later on . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this opens the DVD @-@ Cop@@ ying dialog . this also allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without project file . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a DVD instead of the normal copying process . also , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . converting / resi@@ zing a DVD with the help of copy dialog will also have to be large enough to capture the entire ( video ) data of the source medi@@ ums in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW drive .
opens the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , so the contents will be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
burning a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , you will need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously used DVD video can be converted . this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used stand@@ alone . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the inserted media . this information is displayed in the content view and contains properties of the medium , such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of toolbar of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is enabled , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , its contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the media .
the content view allows you to select and drag files to the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive has been selected in the folder view with a corresponding CD / DVD .
the header bar is a nar@@ rower section that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header bar does not have a real function , it looks nice and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog window to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key signature to the bottom .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; Setup Wizard . this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be done . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and fine @-@ tuning the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled , for example , via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , so your taste and the type of your task are crucial to which of the programs you give the preference .
in this chapter we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions common to all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other features for creating new projects .
void copy@@ C@@ d ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void copy@@ rights ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method one gets a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , a project can be created using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( K@@ URL : : list ur@@ ls , Q@@ string parent ) void conf@@ am@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volume id ( Q@@ string id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ x CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der review d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT @-@ add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ receipt / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ t@@ xt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio creator ; is an audio CD ; it is easy to read audio CD ; s can easily be read and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are also possible depending on encoder installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in wa@@ v files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that en@@ code these wa@@ v files ( these encoder packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ ders may be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP3 or O@@ GG format or in other formats as the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , the reading of the &amp; CD ; , will be used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders need to be installed . all these programs are usually already available for any Linux distri@@ butions . however , only the enco@@ ders need to be installed which are needed . if for example FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which encoding / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer sets a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ tagged creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out audio data from the &amp; CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device does not handle the protection , it is not possible to avoid a protected audio CD ; avoid buying copy protected audio CD ; s !
while setting @-@ up only needs to be done once ( but the setup dialog can be inv@@ oked as often as a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD will be explained . this will ( hopefully ) lead to an understanding of the slim approach of the user interface you will often stum@@ ble across at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ ders are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; retrieve information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or work completely without network , with everything recorded manually .
this is just a short list of commands from the main window . on the step by step example you can find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tabs for configur@@ ing the program .
start the CD@@ DB request of CD data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the internet first must be established . )
start reading and - if a encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup index - the encoding .
a sub @-@ menu opens with a list of available enco@@ ders , so selecting with another encoder can be read as the default . it must be noted that previously the encoder settings in the encoding settings tab was configured in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already selected file is selected for encoding rather than a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as Prot@@ ocols , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for Program@@ mer events ( such as read@@ out the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as En@@ co@@ der , for setting up the encoder ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter disc@@ usses sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression rates and helps you choose the right enco@@ ders .
if no audio information is lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . in addition to FLA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acousti@@ cal model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over mp3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit rate , the differences become less important since both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license issues
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG recording devices is available .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music scores , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate around 5.5 . requires 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex tracks of a track . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 kb@@ ps for all tracks of a song . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and aut@@ oph@@ istic@@ s.@@ But not good enough for HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or collected by the program automatically from fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . they can be passed / needed with &amp; k@@ tagged creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the coding explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add titles to the keyword ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t by l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ video@@ js ; added . the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; co @-@ stimul@@ ators ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / write the audio CDs , so that everyone else can download the information instead of themselves into the computer . it must be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( editor &apos;s note : this is meant by the author ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from getting information from the CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained anyway on a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ video@@ creator ; actively selecting an address box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b may be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address as the used in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears that the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( this can only be known to the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ tagged creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally adjacent mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online call from &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only updates to the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is being used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution , if this has not happened yet .
to save the read wa@@ v files , the enco@@ ders and thus the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening are predefined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ n@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting the encoder . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab yourself .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used . this is also required for pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer are in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a encoder , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg . console ) . you have to replace &apos; l@@ ame &apos; by the name of the installed encoder .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and reading rights on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ n@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check the shell of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are somehow still unsure about what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want .
in this example we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and use our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine since it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write access to it ( eg by trying to copy something inside with the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; something which is probably done only once , and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each output &amp; CD ;
here we determine the enco@@ ders to use for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program to download the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the CD ; data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them for each read of a &amp; CD ; change if the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab can help and an attempt with the entries of the device desig@@ nations for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the tab General Settings . here is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is loaded / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only in case of incomplete information , select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that you will be informed when data on creating keywords ( tags ) is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b calcul@@ ator .
note : the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server while reading the &amp; CD ; it must be connected to the internet to access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry is found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory name / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory and fil@@ en@@ ame will be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , disable the selection boxes and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , this is over 6@@ 20 MB big , consider this twice if this is worth it . to fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection boxes must be selected , at least the first . mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data is to get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server nearby . on this path , the load is distributed between the hosts , but this setting will work first .
both work equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls en@@ code the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , perhaps there is more luck with the protocol 80 as the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example we do not want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice .
simply take the settings from the screen shot . ( make sure the / tmp folder exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously interpreted pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore simply try yourself .
CD ; check out the last piece : check it to check the &amp; CD ; check it out at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must specify the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . this can be useful if only space on another drive is present . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances , something must be sc@@ rolled to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression ratio is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in the event of a later change in tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of WAV files to be enco@@ ded simultaneously : in a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one WAV file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; this configuration is used as the default for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have clever@@ ly chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section we describe how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; we will create and set up MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , is set up in the previous section . first , a connection to the internet is built , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each output &amp; CD ; repeat .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from the data collected for a CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually enter data instead of fet@@ ching it from the internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; can be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , look for the Help section in the Questions and Ans@@ wers section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the CD has been successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album will be shown .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key to your &amp; CD ; a window appears , and you can select the database entry that matches your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button on the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you will need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 2 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the &apos; Album &apos; entry field .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the &apos; Current title &apos; input field unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the comment field below may be individually m@@ apped for each individual comment , the album &apos;s commentary box is used for comments that are common to all tracks of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of data from fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the screen@@ shot below . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for comment field . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have set unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audio creator .
you can change tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders and file formats . see Help with the encoder to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously agrees with the style of the read @-@ out CD ; in this example this is not important since we do not provide the &amp; CD data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and album will be shown above the parts list .
note that it has a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line turns off the selection of the piece . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the button All items on the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at one time .
was started by clicking on the button sel@@ ector selecting the selection process , then this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what runs out .
click on the tab button to switch to the order pane . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to check the jobs . the first piece is read just on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
you will see this error message if you try to work with a encoder you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we entered here in the example . did you check if you have write access to the temporary files and destination folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this allows reading and encoding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code . for low @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear . the used computer with an AM@@ D@@ 64 appears to have no problem at simultaneous reading and encoding ( however , two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the top left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio creator , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ video@@ creator ; nowadays , CVS is maintained as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . however , if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions already include a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ video@@ js ; install the k@@ de@@ multimedia package from your distribution . if you are reading this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is aimed at people comp@@ iling from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs once it runs , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hi , still reading ? even if only the help menu cli@@ cked after the first start of the program without any indication of how it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is considered the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ tagged creator . if you want to add something useful or change it , let it do . at least only after making contact with the author . and if you are reading this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion .
strange , if you &apos;ve managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er from &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , it also has real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some features that other and UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs on &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a Sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the procedure used .
session support . if you want to quit while playing a song , k@@ mid will start again next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesi@@ zers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button on the toolbar , select the Play from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will automatically start once you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces , it will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play one piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and running with the knob .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows left and right of the speed display and change the playback speed . to restore the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a play is played , a pressure on the spac@@ eb@@ ar acts like pressing the button pause or selecting the menu item pause in the menu item , so interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be saved in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use song text and others both . some pieces have no lyrics at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can specify which events should be displayed and even better : the event type will be automatically determined using a song , so you don &apos;t have to manually set the kar@@ aoke text . however , you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other way .
in case you want to set an event type , select the entries text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summari@@ ze , which will be played back in turn . in this section you will see how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find it in the menu item under the heading Organ@@ ize .... Click on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can set each one in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . remember this if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button Add a song . it appears in turn , the file dialog with which you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
when automatically adding to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the row from the sub@@ menu of the player sequence of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the Next song button , select the next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right .
to jump back a song , select the item predic@@ tion piece , the item predic@@ tion piece from the menu item or press the arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but it does not matter as it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesi@@ zers that are not general MIDI capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano , in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type , and thus always lets a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM instruments and so on ) .
unfortunately there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you need to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI Map is a text file that stores all the necessary settings for playing a piece .
each section may appear only once , except the Key@@ map section , which may appear so often as desired . but the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different Text@@ ID ( see below ) .
def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ... EN@@ D
you see Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not general MIDI compatible .
in this section you will see how General MIDI cartridges are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the Equ@@ al sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM @-@ patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave blank lines for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all sounds that need this instrument to play on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun .
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is meant with the term drum patch of the patch , where each sound represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where sound means the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards have it ) .
the Key@@ map section is used to specify how tones are displayed on a specific channel or instrument .
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important as well as its presence . so you need to create 128 items .
you can define multiple Key@@ boards for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Key@@ boards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are used above all to make sounds on the percussion channel . see for example the provided &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Key@@ boards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this section can be used to map out some channels to others . for example , if you want to swa@@ p the first and second channel , do this in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key map with the name Name for this channel will be defined . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events that try to change the patch on this channel will be ignored . in this case , patch x will always be used .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the percussion channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der event with the value n , this is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM pre@@ tends that a keyboard , which receives a pitch bench@@ marking event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a note higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two notes up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . this can be found in the Settings menu , point MIDI Settings .
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards see which sounds are played straight .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a drop @-@ down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button no longer lights up green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has two different views ( up to now ) to display the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the item Channel view : settings
the speed LCD indicates the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , etc ; . this allows the same MIDI file to perform very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you get a similar sound quality . with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , speed , etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid . that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example , by k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all the files individually .
agree , so support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag and drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
first , activate Automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the standard speed , double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Desktop with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or tack@@ ed ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) or if I want to play a file , just change into the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; change the window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
if you only want to quickly listen to a file without adding it to a collection , turn the setting Automatic addition to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . opening files
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . First you just want to play the first file . so set the setting Automatic addition to the collection and open A.@@ Ther@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid , and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to write on &amp; k@@ mid .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.com Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much time for my hob@@ bies but I &apos;m trying to take a bit of time . as hob@@ bies I have programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or if you just want to make me happy , send me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
they make me really excited when you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will list under Friends of &amp; k@@ mid . before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me as I may have the file .
I &apos;ve written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and won &apos;t get money from anyone . I want to emphasize that I only keep programming because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch at AW@@ E cards was too high .
my thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ IS support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Marc Di@@ ef@@ en@@ bruch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error notification or even a suppor@@ tive email .
and of course I would like to thank all these excellent musicians on the net , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on his homepage , which is located at ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and view images . you will also find links to other kar@@ aoke songs , etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you do not have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course not hear music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; S@@ ME ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ on@@ o and FF@@ MPEG . the program is used to play video files from M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called do@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that is displayed only when information is returned .
it is possible to save the favorite links under the Book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Continu@@ ous Play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional level of hierarch@@ ies . if you have an entry , your group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and the playback begins with the associated entry .
the categories &apos; current play &apos; , TV and continuous playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do that if &amp; S@@ ME ; not running . the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / KM@@ Viewer / / directory can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category , click on it from the View menu and next edit mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you need to select play@@ lists from the menu and select either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when editing mode leaves or another group is selected without adjusting the playlist .
as a result of the author &apos;s convenience , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during startup and exit can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and change &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; S@@ ME ; will keep the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ player / verb@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Viewer / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml ; the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically ended by opening another source . this would be annoying at the end @-@ animation however , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; S@@ ME ; here the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the toolbar of S@@ MB . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; S@@ ME ; everything has to be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , like setting up the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within and S@@ MEs ; it can even add the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
for the &amp; S@@ ME ; &apos; flash &apos; to play in HTML pages , the &amp; S@@ ME needs to be specified as a service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file As@@ sign@@ ments of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; S@@ ME ; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . the started process is called pop player . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is inside &amp; S@@ MB ; ( View , console , or console from context menu to check ) .
to ensure that a given back@@ end is always taken for a specific mim@@ e type ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by manual modification of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; S@@ ME ; can be played by TV cards , either by M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be st@@ owed , the device to use must be configured and the TV channels . for this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the KM@@ player , the dialog appears in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the encoding must be found ( e.g. it &apos;s PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name probably contains a dv@@ b in it .
since V@@ DR support for S@@ MEs can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( presumably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux expansion must be functional for the X server . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
internally , S@@ MEs are used for different names for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ resource , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ d source . when enabled , they start playing the playlist .
is there any way I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to be executed as user root after the device is inserted . it is absolutely certain to make sure / dev / c@@ drom shows on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts up slowly , why do I have to check my CPU for performance each time ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support , and is needed to compile &amp; manage .
L@@ ate@@ x ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be applied to the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD should be used ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project includes some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; -@@ website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users do not have to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the box ; -@@ website .
if you have questions about the compilation of &amp; Ki@@ le ; on or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed at the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the latex ; desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides the ability to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and customized access to all &amp; latex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; latex ; reference and the powerful project management have to be called .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to learn its possibilities the manual should be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; begin .
for natural latex ; is the right pron@@ unciation : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , a lay@@ man ( in@@ lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while only a good overview of natural latex is given , it is not the ultimate book to do so . to be properly profi@@ cient , good books such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 should be used .
just like other mark@@ up languages includes &amp; latex ; an introduction with which the general features like paper format , page number@@ ing and text size can be specified as well as a body with the text . the introduction includes at least the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the quick @-@ entry assistant at &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an useful feature for fast creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; The selection of the wizard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) provides some options for the creation of the document . it can also be made some settings related to the document .
document classes : this defines the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
encoding : the encoding of the system is set . the encoding of the system should be used . modern systems increasingly use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for proper processing of the &amp; latex ; documents ) .
this list contains the usually used auxiliary packages for and latex ; for the integration , they have to be selected only in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used in the preparation of German texts .
new users don &apos;t have to worry . it &apos;s just a brief description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you see larger areas of a gray text on the screen , it is quite likely that any mathematical environment is not closed . however , it will be spar@@ ed by the modest appearance of the output file . however , you will save time and money by high@@ lighting .
with the automatic execution of the environment , a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for the input of the text ) and the corresponding line for setting the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu settings box ; set up La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of a mouse .
when creating your own and latex files , the recovery search can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; ger@@ many @-@ dependent file ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ inter@@ dependent File ) &#93; is created , jumps &amp; box ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the latex ; -@@ source .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the output types of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; there are many tools to view , convert and print out DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the back search , the elements of the DVI ; file are selected to the editor and as soon as an element is cli@@ cked in the DVI ; file , the corresponding section is ski@@ pped in the latex ; the source code is cli@@ cked to the corresponding point in the DVI ; viewer .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document the work is simplified with others .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
quick build : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are no source code errors ) .
video surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file will be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick build . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when viewing the Edit toolbar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection boxes were developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for fast structure of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available and latex commands for sub@@ division are :
the selection field Additional is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , foot@@ notes or references . the available options are :
name : this command creates a description for a section , an image , or a different element .
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( selection of a selection field possible ) .
when using quote , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files corresponding editors are necessary . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ von@@ e is used for the definition of the font . the fonts can be specified for the main text , the notes etc . , the following fonts are available :
when calling &amp; ki@@ le ; two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from the ground up by hand .
the brackets following the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the fonts . if the fonts are not specified at the beginning , this can also happen in the text .
once the above source code sample has been entered , the &amp; latex needs to be compiled . the simplest way to do this is to use the menu build or the button &apos;s quick build .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically triggers the storage .
if the compilation of the document fails , the logging must be checked after the errors . when using quick build , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is different from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } may be attributed to the approxim@@ ation of the fonts within the environment .
the changes will only be maintained within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } . there is no limit ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fonts , bold prints , passive printing , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is valid for the startup printing and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be displayed itali@@ ci@@ d with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; latex ; mark@@ up language was presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
once a bit of text was entered in the wizard , some adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . for this , a quote , a few places in bold and cur@@ sive printing and a poem can be used to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , it can be returned to the editor by using the editor &apos;s View or C@@ trl E ( on the internal viewer ) .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try it and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ inter@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI , the same steps are necessary as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed by file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file is created from the &amp; latex ; source text , the conversion into changed other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar .
the search warrant permits direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a suitable setting for all &amp; latex ; bin@@ dings . for this , only Modern is set up under Settings Box ... Tools Building should be selected .
in order to execute the search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source text and then cli@@ cked on for preference . the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI ; viewer takes place then .
using this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; latex ; document from &amp; Ki@@ le ; be opened and j@@ umped to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set up as text editor ( Set@@ ting the ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if the use of quick build @-@ up of the &amp; DVI ; the viewer does not open , an error can be present . if an error is present , this will be summari@@ zed in the logging file or in the message window .
the logging file stores the source of error in the source . in the editor you can then use La@@ Te@@ X errors and La@@ Te@@ X errors for spr@@ Ã ¼ n@@ ge between the errors . the logging file always specifies the line in which the error appears . to view the faulty line , the error in the logging must be cli@@ cked and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the defective row .
once you cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window appears to select the template you want to use for the document . the default options are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or used by the wizard to quickly create a new document . more information can be found in the section .
common User of &amp; latex ; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; Ki@@ le ; templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file needs to be opened or a new file created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by dra@@ gging an existing document and selecting file template from document ... creating .
when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings Box ... Settings can be set .
when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering into document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ &#93; { items } .
the simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be taken :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard one .
a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files created . a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and searched through the steps described below .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; cate ; can be made in the menu directly from &amp; Ki@@ le ; out .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to experience its possibilities the manual should be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; begin .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference , which can be called through the menu help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; they can be used as well as their syntax .
double click with a twisted C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that by clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ skip only \ \ par will be selected .
when dra@@ gging the text with left mouse button , the selected text will be copied automatically to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with the right Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search and highlight the most different kinds of source texts . for example , the latex commands differ from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color .
many assistants can add additional jumping marks . this is a unique type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu items Edit Favor@@ ites or the respective keys allow the jump to the next or last jump mark . this is also highlighted with this jump mark , so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a character .
editing is probably one of the key aspects when using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already excellent features have been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; source text is added ; special commands for their selection . under Edit drop@@ outs , the following commands for text selection are included :
select a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning does not include a text with persistent lines ( as in other text editors ) . this extended meaning includes tables , and latex commands , and all other lines of the source text . the only prev@@ entative action in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is that the paragra@@ phs are separated by two empty lines .
select the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also ex@@ its &amp; latex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands with a return line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , of course , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ate ; offers the key C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides with its own commands for faster possibility . under Edit delete , the following commands are included for the deletion of the text :
del@@ etes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is included in the description of the selected paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for more commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with natural latex ; .
this command jumps to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command jumps to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command for the surrounding area .
if the cursor is located before or inside the \ \ begin { environment } command , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview can be lost quickly . this command will close the last modified environment , so that the ne@@ sted ambient structure will not be destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups specified by bra@@ ces { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that match those from editing environment .
this command jumps to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
this command jumps to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly clasp clasp .
if the cursor is in front of or behind the cur@@ ly clip of a &amp; tex ; group # is j@@ umped to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of ne@@ sted group@@ ed par@@ enth@@ eses , the overview can be lost quickly . this command will close the last modified group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple application marks are used as man@@ ners . for the beneficial implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &apos; is used for two simple application marks . also for ending the request the sign &apos; is used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and for two conclu@@ sive quote characters for &amp; latex ; one .
this automatic entry of double quote characters can be set up under Settings Box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
you can also use foreign @-@ specific settings ( e.g. German or French ) and German or French reference marks . there are also many other languages available .
when pressing Shift ; Enter key &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break but also the command \ \ item .
within a table environment close &amp; box ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a close line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added under Settings Box ; set up La@@ Te@@ X .
some users want to sort the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby arrange all the E@@ t character ( amp ; ) among each other . when pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; looks &amp; ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the adjacent line . although this tab@@ l@@ ator is not the added one , add &amp; box ; some space for the columns position of the current tab@@ l@@ ature .
although &amp; k@@ ate ; already offering good source code completion , this has been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; latex ; ) even extended . three of them work as needed and the other two are for automatic processing . all these modes can be set up for different modes of operation under Settings Box ... fully termin@@ ated .
at the beginning a new environment will begin with the command \ \ begin { environment } &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back key , the last letter of the input will be removed and , understand@@ ably , the complete list will be gr@@ ati@@ fied . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed by selecting a command . alternatively , von &amp; Ki@@ le ; also jump marks can be inserted , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by means of the Edit but@@ t tag and the desired parameters can then be added .
under Settings Box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete Settings can be made to these lists . it can be used to select different W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ st lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; commands as well as stor@@ ages of general language use .
the command mode is not necessary for the execution of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call to complete destruction mode will result in a large list with environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for completing the environments .
when calling the full @-@ service mode over the menu , complete surroundings or the key @-@ root Alt + Shift key , the command is automatically inserted in the environment and it appears to \ \ begin { . after that , the environment can be continued in a very simple way and by pressing the input button .
after this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; detects that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added .
under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete Settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of the processing mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; support user @-@ defined lists of he@@ aters , which are immediately replaced by longer strings . lists can be set up under Settings Box ... file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is typ@@ ed and the word processing mode is initiated through the menu or the single C@@ trl + Alt key , the letter L will be replaced by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large stor@@ ages are not helpful for automatic complete failure . however , it was noted that many words are written more than once in a document . this provides &amp; Ki@@ le ; the complete charge for all already written words .
this mode can be set up in the Settings box ... le block complete . here also the threshold value for displaying the complete defense can be set .
the complete destruction files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / chest / complete / mode / file / mode / the Pers@@ Start folder . mode stands for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( re@@ br@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the dialog graphics are designed to create graphics as easy as possible . to supervis@@ e the basics of graphic formats , the sections should be followed and followed .
PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is applied , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
in order to examine the results of the work , you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the Men@@ Ã ¼ s compilation , compilation , conversion and creation view .
for comp@@ iling the source text for the viewer as well as the ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion , the key root Alt ; 2 can be used . after that , the DVI ; file can be viewed in the standard viewer using the old ; 3 , the DVI ; the file is converted to a PS file and can be viewed by the old ; 5 the PS file .
when using the quick build instruction a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will be opened every time .

the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . this will immediately benefit the plug @-@ in system and do not need to wait until someone builds the t@@ opped in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start using the Edit menu Edit menu . this opens the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage and add all contained plug@@ ins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a storage location is used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
many people often work on a project in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears fat after you are : text .
nick@@ names and attitudes of one &apos;s own identity are important in terms of news and ann@@ ot@@ ations . see for further information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another benefit by cap@@ turing the members of the team : it can be an event for information to team leaders when something is happening . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something is happening in the project . an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone was working on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that launches a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project , etc ;
on the site event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the receiver list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub@@ project leader . see how such leaders are set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
enter comments is simple . you can either select the note entry from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the specified nick@@ name of the team member , role plays a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Sub@@ project leader In the area and sub@@ project managers should be given the appropriate area or sub@@ project names , as shown in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the comment invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages supported by D@@ TD @-@ agnos@@ tic and web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in .
the settings can be set up using Settings Qu@@ anta ... This dialog extends over several pages that are treated one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion may be changed with it . the entries are :
large / lower@@ case of tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal size / lower@@ case means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag XML files .
large / lower@@ case of attributes : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal size / lower@@ case means the attributes are inserted as described in the tag XML files .
automatically include tags : when checked , it will be added for tags for which the closing tag is optional .
do not automatically include tags : as above for all other tags except for the simple tags .
automatically update start and finish day : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic sub@@ stitution of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding encoding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : types of mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for det@@ ecting various types of files . by pressing the Standard button , the def@@ aults can be restored .
default character encoding : encoding of newly created or in other ways than opening open opened files ( where encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting is removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . however , this setting is removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates backup copies periodic@@ ally so that in case of a power failure or crash , the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . also for un@@ saved documents , a backup is created regularly , according to the set time .
preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view ( or documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
reset the default window settings to the default during the next start is useful when the user interface is passed through modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and clicking / dropping views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameter .
the warning message range is used to control the display of warnings by checking out no more inquiries .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it may define the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source view in shared mode . see the different modes , see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree representing the representation of par@@ ser nodes in the document can be set in detail .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the structure tree settings the visibility of nodes in the tree can be adjusted , the update frequency of the tree during editing and how deep in a change of the structure tree is to be opened . empty nodes are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
the area to specify abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of template ) that will be deployed when editing to larger text . abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there may be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are K@@ part applications from third page , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ part @-@ enabled application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin when starting , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load the component in &quot; read @-@ only &quot; mode : check if the plugin refuses to load . only @-@ Read @-@ Parts usually refuse to load if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct , then save the application even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , debu@@ gging has been completely re@@ designed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) debu@@ gger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G debu@@ gger . instead , a debu@@ gger plugin concept has been implemented that allows different implem@@ entations via plug@@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , which includes support for the use of &amp; gu@@ ise ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
the use of the debu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable debu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin selection box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a debu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the debu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported features of the debu@@ gger , anything or part of the following functionality is available .
this action makes the connection to the debu@@ gger if necessary , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bug requests . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debu@@ gger , so normally you don &apos;t have to pay attention to it .
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ ging session Star@@ ts the session . closes the connection to the debu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the debu@@ gger output .
instruc@@ ts the debu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens , while the script is stopped , execution will continue . if a debu@@ gger is started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the debu@@ gger to begin exec@@ uting the script without sending information to the monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens , while a script is stopped , execution starts . if a debu@@ gger is given , the execution starts once a request is made .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger exec@@ utes the next statement in the script without going into the functions or include .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger exec@@ utes the next statement in the script , with it being corrected in functions and include .
instruc@@ ts the debu@@ gger to skip the statement and go to the next as if there were not the current .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered that is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .

&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and &amp; CSS ; s . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag Fol@@ ders are handy , symbol @-@ oriented bars of image buttons ( above the editing pane ) , inser@@ ting text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details of conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
tag XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day it displays the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool lists allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without the risk of writing errors .
tag folder are nothing but folders . they contain only the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder bear the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the tag XML elements and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but nothing else than one element .
the type of tag is a script function . when used , &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the method method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of attribute . additionally , it contains additional tags describing how to display this attribute , etc ; This is a merely element type element .
returns the source code used to fill in the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that mer@@ ges the elements of a list together . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
specify the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the item is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each column ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
returns a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a single element type .
returns a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and need to be ne@@ at@@ ly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces don &apos;t influence anything , but look for &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is the top in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to start windows and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not currently available . currently , the check is only performed when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
below is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; loading function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this tag XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via D@@ TD &apos;s Edit D@@ TD settings . with this , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = User 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD specification . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name will be used as nick@@ name .
an action can be created with settings actions ... can be created . click New action leading to the same dialog :
the keyboard short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the Custom button , a key short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer the current short@@ cut is removable .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the model@@ ed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can start external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to use the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even are the Quick Start dialog or the different See in ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , try &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the script at : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text unique is added to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the input field input can be determined which is to be sent to the default input . options are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written on the standard output ; error messages , to the standard error output . it can be specified what to do with the text written on the standard output by setting the output field output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group . in given case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the brand .
once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings to set up actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan to use it , enable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit Tag &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialog if available so that input is possible when using the action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the menu , Graphics Other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edi@@ ting Size other .
please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green it is usually displayed as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least indicate a message to the user that clicking on this symbol will be inserted ; -@@ day in the current document will be inserted .
after creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action . this is done via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags , as there are which ones , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the toolbar , or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separ@@ ators . open the toolbar dialog using Settings Tool@@ bar . make sure that the desired toolbar is selected .
after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the toolbar .
for example , I would like to give you a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my toolbar can believe that the counter@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar has to be tested by using all of the symbols to ensure that everything works .
after new XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust their file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( n ) if a file is opened from the appropriate type .
perhaps the most worth mentioning extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you might be able to check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory if someone has done that for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . we will leave the first part to you , we will handle the second one here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation html files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation section 1 = func@@ .@@ html tag@@ 1 = func@@ .@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ .@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation something like this :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except by reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing , but look for &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Resource files will be replaced .
the content section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file which is used to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is displayed . by selecting the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( context list ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of contex@@ tual elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file doc@@ r@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your doc@@ r@@ c file ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that they are good and worth sharing , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , such as which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . you won &apos;t get rich , but be proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the failed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P pack@@ ets , toolbar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . in different jobs there is an Email menu item that sends D@@ TD D@@ TD @-@ package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool bar tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the script tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions are checked and only made available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication . to make a major contribution we recommend to sign the resources , for which there is a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of resources is ensured , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can choose one . in the dialog new resource , you need to fill out the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
upload can be uploaded from the D@@ TD D@@ TD @-@ package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) from the D@@ TD &apos;s D@@ TD package , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in XML format . there &apos;s the easiest way to convert a D@@ TD into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from D@@ TD Load and Con@@ vert a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description that is to be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! doc@@ type Defini@@ tional line : the string that should appear in ! doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are a few key concepts . in order to understand them and take full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ arise themselves with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool lists , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS , patterns up to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most constra@@ ined size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ powers the joint use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the tree view , the tabs with information and the toolbar . please consult , and for more detailed information about these areas .
you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a contex@@ tual menu with the current document , like closing the current , other or all the tabs , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jumping to a book@@ mark or exec@@ uting CVS commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the Editor area lead to a further context menu concerning the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste / paste ) , edit the text under the mouse @-@ cursor , or open the file if the string is called a file under the mouse cursor .
at the top end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool lists is shown . in the course of the further expansion of the Edi@@ tor@@ f@@ enst@@ ers , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
the use of tool bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert in your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . now you can insert the data for this just added tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog various fields .
the design views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate to the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate it , open it and browse it . in the presentation with tabs are available for files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it displays all files in the project and allows the management of files in the project by right mou@@ sec@@ lick . actions such as Add , Remove , Upload or Del@@ ete the files from the storage medium can be done with the context menu displayed .
another option from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website , etc ; All possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on where they are used . global Tem@@ plates are always available , local templates are only available for the respective user and templates in projects are only usable in the project . more on templates can be found in .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of re@@ integration in Global , Lok@@ al and Project works also here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . via the right mouse button more functions are available , such as the script to start , edit or email it .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking an element the cursor is placed on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element opens a list of commands related to navigation and refres@@ her the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . it can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces with it . the content @-@ oriented entry system allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project specific documentation can be added , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed using the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts that are executed give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool bar is extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command displayed . the chocolate @-@ side of the toolbar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; and if they receive a toolbar in an email , they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . to do this auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 is located in the PAT@@ H in front of your bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor would ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; Develop@@ er community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of why develop what someone else has developed , but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to dramatically speed up the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can be increased almost every task . by the program com@@ man@@ ders , they can expand &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ( read more about it in . )
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and has been rapidly expanded into a mature editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
for more details , go to help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or help k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; currently being developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick @-@ access list of files that you have opened . this list changes each time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest entry being removed .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check the section on templates . if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converts when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there , converted special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ write , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction .
converts the text from the clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; sp@@ elling , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to / off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script releases error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and predefined expression to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of script actions and the debu@@ gger .
extension and Swit@@ ching of the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a click of a mouse .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the cursor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents are group@@ ed in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
Browse the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows you to copy graphics files to your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project .
upload the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; managed by the project . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find the details .
loads a project toolbar . these are kept in project / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : locally or Project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . it only creates the name . actions need to be added by settings actions ... or you will be asked when you want to save the toolbar .
remove a toolbar from the field of view . this will not delete them from the disk . if you have not yet saved the toolbar , you will be asked if you would like to do that .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Team so that the toolbar can be present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as app@@ endi@@ x .
allows tool bar up@@ loading to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
load a &amp; D@@ TD ; that made you or anyone else and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed , without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . if this is global and does not exist in the global K@@ DE directory , the loading will fail .
this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded toolbar . if the default ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current day preferences dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activating or de@@ activating the smart insert of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting by means of tools is denied if this tag contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on them . clicking an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activates it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the current version .
select the type of line identification . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document on the basis of the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes take time or cause un@@ nice graphics . it is recommended that card card mode , which is also the default setting , or sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry will enable the corresponding sub@@ window to be activated .
enables the status bar to be displayed at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window respectively .
the changes in this dialog affect any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .

a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar , or which ones can be added and the sequences can be changed .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; nbsp ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , since the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project , e.g. after completion of the project name . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file will be filled in automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ add@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and tool@@ bars by default . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . in case of server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
do not hook up if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project will be included . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook up .
this option displays all files and folders within the main folder and you can make an exact choice of coup@@ ons .
this displays a list of files in the root folder . you can select the files you want by hook or , by removing the tick , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new Project Wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be changed in the menu with Project Properties menu in the sub@@ window Pro@@ files or using the Shift key ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders is possible ) , which are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or are excluded from the project .
the project view that is loaded when opening the project . it can be read more about project views .
this allows the desired debu@@ gger to be selected . currently only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the debu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button .
in the sub @-@ window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by ha@@ sting one &apos;s own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , event actions can be activated and these actions can be added , altered or deleted . event actions are executed when a certain event occurs , such as backing up a file . see the details .
by default , it opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that has been opened . this behavior can not be affected at this time .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the menu Project or Open Project File Open from the toolbar . the Open Project dialog is displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files will be found . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries Open and Open with ... in the context menu that can be activated with the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
enables removal of the current profile . if only one profile exists , the button is removed to prevent removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten when it comes to Program@@ ming . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ safe password on the disk drive option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many upload profiles can be created and the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog displays :
this is the server name on which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the disk concealed so that it can &apos;t be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can give many views in a project , i.e. by simple exchange of view various files and tool lists can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored , opened or deleted from the Project or Project Tool@@ bar , accessible via Settings Tool@@ bar Project Tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which you have the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to your own way of working .
as mentioned above , tool bar in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best stack@@ able through the toolbar . use and addition differ . adding toolbar boxes will be treated at the bottom of the section Adding tool@@ bars .
the toolbar and the icons on it can be set by either context menu ( right click on the toolbar ) , where other actions such as toolbar can be removed , tool@@ bars can be removed , tool@@ bars can be inserted , which results in the dialog , where it can be specified , which actions should be visible on this or other toolbar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the entries action will additionally be removed and action processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings Tool@@ bar ... and settings can be set .
templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates basically like a common fil@@ esystem with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the limitations you imagine for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . more information about the template tree is available .
documents can be of any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . typically , more specialized documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . one makes a simple framework for the purpose and arran@@ ges the work in a corresponding way to be efficient . some examples may be found in the template tree below global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
this kind of template is useful if not a new document is to be past@@ ed based on a template but the same text area repeatedly in the documents . you can find everything from a comment to a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples are available in the template tree among global templates .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire sites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
create a document structure as you like ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book , etc ; . ) and choose File As template save as a local template ....
once this has happened , you will notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) , the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under Project Tem@@ plates .
select text in your document and click File As template save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply be dra@@ gged along with dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging on the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file into a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as dra@@ gging and dropping or past@@ ing over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
you can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project files and select a site template , enter a name for the template and secure it . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can also be stored as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ fix he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically connect with &amp; PHP ; create , insert or link files with them . in addition , you can keep track of some things while using templates in projects .
the template structure in sub@@ window templates is based on the files laid in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / templates . each folder corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
to set the behavior of a folder in the template list , right click on the folder and select Properties from the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded as soon as par@@ ental attributes are inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the root folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set up , it would basically disable templates in this path unless they are explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text component . if nothing appears , you will probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows pre@@ ordered or illustrated text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and enables by copying of content templates into a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing right mouse button ) over a full command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source text editor available from the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; side and a cursor . then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor , where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that contains &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol indicates the default of &amp; PHP ; source text . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible in both the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor and the cursor in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is activated , this mode is already active , the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke offset the active cursor from one window to the other , while maintaining the position in the document .
the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be adjusted via settings Qu@@ anta .... When choosing V@@ PL , you can choose between synchronization with one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the web page , it is possible to select the document properties . this allows editing of invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used to reduce the manual coding .
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating the appearance of pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons under the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported yet .
it is possible to include an external CSS sty@@ les@@ he@@ et by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the corresponding file .
using the cursor is possible as in a word processor , due to moving with the arrows . under rare circumstances the cursor acts as usual . the marking functions as usual . text can be inserted by inser@@ ting and del@@ eting by return button or remo@@ ver key .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way through the toolbar , as in the source text editor . it must be noted that inser@@ ting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor day , surrounded with text , must be removed any other returning anchor day .
some tool lists such as the table assistant or the Listen Assistant are disabled . they will later work in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for studying style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style template can be trac@@ ed .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , except &amp; k@@ de ; still the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .

on systems with installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can scroll through the arrow keys / down through the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the previously executed commands .
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotation marks can be used to pass composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument , a stop is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I have written .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts during mer@@ ging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see exactly what had changed inside these lines . and there was no indication of where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within one line and changes to white marks . later , many other useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function converted &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost to a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when automatically selecting the correct changes . the merge editor among the differences windows allows you to resolve conflicts and at the same time displays the result to be expected . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you to merge and merge complete folders . this screen shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check Ko@@ de , you will like this feature .
differences in white signs and tabs are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left . ( no more trouble if someone changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different .
if all files have the same name but are located in different folders , then you can simplify the typing work by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der Fol@@ der Fol@@ der Fol@@ der Fol@@ der Fol@@ der Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der Fol@@ der Fol@@ der Fol@@ der Fol@@ der 2
the opening dialog allows for manually typing fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog will remember your selection and show it next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed .
by clicking the Fol@@ der ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , for B and C , however , a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
when mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active for target and can be edited . however , it is not necessary to define immediately a output file . you can do this step later when saving .
the Configuration button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / merge .
sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board to the active comparison window . the comparison then begins immediately . in the opening dialog , you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively large effort . you &apos;d have to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : at the moment , you can remove nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and past@@ ing ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Window C is optional . ) Each Info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest over the line for a while . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , one sees the color which file is different . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files . that &apos;s good to see in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) .
when differences are found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare cases . )
the vertical line dividing the merge column from the text is interrupted at places where the respective source file has no rows . if the line breaks are activated , the line will be dotted with a broken line .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the inscription text : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; when you have edited the result . usually , it already contains text by automatic mer@@ ging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons to find the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , every difference at the same time must also be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the line will be selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also highlight a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group otherwise would not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current pane and on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic mer@@ ging or by manual processing ; then it will be displayed in these lines of text &amp; lt ; No line in the queue ; this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marking you may copy and paste somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : if the options are ignored when selecting the sources or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters .
navigate primarily with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side up , end , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
in the delivery window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the insertion key , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns will synchron@@ ize the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navig@@ ating with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( C@@ trl @-@ down / C@@ trl @-@ above ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ down / C@@ trl @-@ picture backwards ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the marking to the clip@@ board , press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ Pa@@ ste ) . there is also the option selection automatically copied . if this is checked , you will automatically copy the option to the clip@@ board and no manual copying . be careful with this option , because you could over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use carriage return + new@@ line drive \ \ r \ . K@@ NO@@ 3 keeps the line end@@ ings of the source files , therefore you should not use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of the last used files will be saved automatically at the exit and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ NO@@ 3- Set up ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c script . if the selected font does not support this representation , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered more ast@@ ray . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically sets an odd color .
if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted .
if you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
you can select which type of line you prefer to save . default value is the commonly used selection of the operating system used .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 first attempt to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others save only one line feed &apos; \ &apos; . if this option is enabled , the car returns will be made visible , but like a white character . during mer@@ ging this option must be disabled .
in the first part of the analysis , the numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . as a result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
by default , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters .
search inten@@ sely after even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in automatic mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before jumping on to the next un@@ resolved conflict .
automatically dis@@ solves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , use the functions Cho@@ ose A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments .
these options are covered in the chapter to scan folders and execute a merge . for details see documentation on how to compare and merge .
if a file is saved and an older version already exists , the original version will be app@@ ended to suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further f@@ use .
adapt the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart , so that the change becomes active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language there is set globally over the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries .
the code for encoding provides a quick note of what the local encoding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has an informal character for you . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this will affect how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option one can set the coding of the output of pre@@ processor commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting of changes in white notes in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded overview column . but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files . after selection of A &amp; lt ; gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to the normal yet another check column with the required information .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just leave the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arrange the comparison panels side by side or over@@ lap each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then instantly decide to merge the files . merge current file in the merge menu also works if you only compare two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as pres@@ et name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart mer@@ ging , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that exactly matches your requirements . you can use this function e.g. for cutting off disturbing parts or correc@@ ting ind@@ entation .
when reading a file it will be given to this remote command first . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only with the line balance . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that exactly matches your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff @-@ results . however , an external program is needed and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for line interc@@ eption to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ U@@ ps the found text in upper@@ case .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all sequences follow the same pattern $ keyword ( \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you are experim@@ enting with sed , you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ NO@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further pre @-@ processing command for line ab@@ out@@ . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Each character between &apos; &#91; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , so every hit is replaced by nothing .
sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements . example :
instead of sed you can also use something different , e.g. per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p only ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor is retained for the display and for mer@@ ging . subsequent operations only change the data that the line interc@@ essor provides .
note : in rare cases when you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often programmers need to edit a lot of files in one folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge complete folders with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders .
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simulate the merge and show the simul@@ ated changes without actually carrying out ,
... execute selected actions with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the File dialog .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 will be used as a base . if no target folder has been specified , use &amp; diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
when you read the folder , a small message window informs about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that have been compared until then are listed .
when scanning the folders is finished , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left ...
each file and folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can open a folder by double @-@ clicking on the + / - or by double @-@ clicking on the item or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub @-@ directories can be opened and all sub @-@ directories can be opened and / or opened .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the name in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind again .
as shown in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
for identical entries , however , the color is identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered iden@@ tically if their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . for folders , age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is green , then yellow becomes and later , when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the synchron@@ izing mode is active when only two folders and no explicit destination folder are specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that afterwards both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees only B as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file ; copied directly after mer@@ ging &amp; c@@ res@@ 3 ; B after A. )
when two folders are merged and the option New file instead of mer@@ ging ( unsure ) is enabled , then examine &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical . if such errors are not eliminated , the merge of the folders cannot be started .
when mer@@ ging , one file is processed after the other . it displays the status column he@@ ed@@ --@@ if the merge is successful , and other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display other columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , then in the Three @-@ folder mer@@ ging mode C is used as the target , B will be chosen as the target and A and / or B will be used as the target when synchron@@ izing .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that could be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : start / continue directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to just merge the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if by conflic@@ ting file types still invalid mer@@ ging actions exist , a message appears that indicates the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box will appear with the Browse , Sim@@ ulate and Cancel options .
choose Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select start / continue directory merge , or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog will appear . then , execute &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; resume its work with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; hit an error , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list see some error messages that will help you skip the cause of the problem . if you continue mer@@ ging again ( F@@ 7 key ) , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before proceeding with mer@@ ging .
if some entries have been merged , comments &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not execute them again at the later compilation of all entries . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered settled . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( set up menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders don &apos;t have to match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ es files that would also be ignored by CVS . many self @-@ generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder is specific to a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hiding attribute . in other file systems , a preceding point is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
links to files : when the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default .
if the option is enabled , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is enabled , the links will be treated as normal folders and searched for recur@@ sively . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; if the option contains a link to itself would result in an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; cras@@ hes . ) This option is disabled in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of deleted , un@@ solved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than simple binary analysis , and much slower as it is applied to files that do not contain text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the modification date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security . please use caution . this option is disabled in default .
there is no real comparison . the files are considered iden@@ tically when they are equal . this can be useful , for example , if the change date has been lost when copying . please use caution . this option is disabled in default .
activate the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the merge suggestions are selected in such a way that afterwards both folders are identical . the results of mer@@ ging files will also be saved in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging , the copying of the newer file is suggested as action . ( this is considered un@@ safe , as it is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and will receive the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension is already existing , it will also delete the normal merge of individual files , not just the mer@@ ging of entire folders . this option is enabled in default .
normally the folder mer@@ ging view remains visible during the merge of individual files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want this , you can turn off the directory &amp; text window and switch between the main window in the Windows menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory &amp; text window .
you probably prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . however , in the -@@ menu , there is also a corresponding menu entry . you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . as soon as you save the result , the status will be reset and the file will not be merged once you run the folder .
however , this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders to open that are on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . you should note a few things :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contained . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be escaped . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space character &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . there is a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link appears on a file or folder . then a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permissions or modification dates . therefore , the permissions or modification dates devi@@ ate from the original . ( please refer to the Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the Size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP from the context menu .
usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; assuming that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then remove &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view into - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; being executed as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in K@@ part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ NO@@ 2 ( now called Com@@ pare ) are already available . in addition , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can run together like the diff@@ 3 program from the diff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or get it that way .
you have compiled the program from the source and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines and next to each other , this is more often the case .
the editor re@@ members for every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to solve a conflict by simply clicking into the source text and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information .
the effort for this was so far too large . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to process greater amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text , it is suddenly gone ; no sr@@ c has been left , and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
in order to be able to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ DE on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
you will find a list of recent changes under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3 sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to compile and install &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; to compile and install on a system , use the following command in the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists thereof .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Removal ) copies into the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) inserts text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position or replaces the current selection .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ read the update folder after changes to these options . )
there are only entries showing differences . this also causes identical files to be copied to the target folder when mer@@ ging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
when you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a thumb@@ nail of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , quit or shift them . this works both inside a desktop as well as several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running it . the applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , Windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; motion is possible both inside a desktop and on other work surfaces .
the context menu depends where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when clicking on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries p@@ ager . if , however , click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize , maximize , On Desktop and End .
maxim@@ izes the application window to full size of desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work areas .
when this field is enabled , the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are shown in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
tick this field lets the &amp; p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is enabled along with name , the names will be marked with folder numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop .
if this field is checked , the background of each desktop is displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displayed .
when this field is checked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angles with the promp@@ ts of the program windows . icon shows the windows with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the layout of the &amp; p@@ ager ; the main window can be determined : classi@@ cally let &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; appear in a 2x@@ N grid , as is known from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal displays all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal and vertical line , which is very good for display on the side of the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move the windows as icons or with their contents . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and select setting up switch ... allows the dialogue settings to appear .
currently this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . If you do not have any write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator . in this file you need to enter the key win@@ dow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and assign it a value . possible values are :
da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package you need to install the K@@ DE basic packages .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ mag ; to enlarge a part of the screen , as if you read the paper a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag ;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
if you like &amp; k@@ ste ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . below , this window is referred to as the magni@@ fying window . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged portion of the screen and is referred to as the selection box below .
in the default setting , you may enlarge the area around the mouse poin@@ ter as a moving magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you may &amp; k@@ may ; cause a selected area of the screen in the magni@@ fier window ( drop @-@ down mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter setting . please note that this may not be able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default c@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection box to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fier window and keep the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fier window . this is also possible with the arrow keys .
if you additionally use the &amp; Shift ; press the key or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use it , you can move the selection box .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner can be moved .
&amp; k@@ may ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
start or stop the update of the ad . stopping the update results in the needed CPU time against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Low , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection box is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ may ; automatically uses your set short commands for saving files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( using the button again load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , pop@@ up and / etc ; .
k@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use an area of the screen , so as if you would use a magni@@ fying glass to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click once the mouse poin@@ ter stops for a while at the same location . it is intended to help people who suffer from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also be caused by the mere moving of the mouse . suffer from pain that is associated with your computer &apos;s use , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet .
to make it clear again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and triggers a mouse click as soon as you inter@@ rupt the movement .
is the smart move enabled , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . this way you can drag the dra@@ gging with pressed mouse button .
this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
if Intel@@ li@@ gent@@ es is switched on , the shooting time will be active ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time will be set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button wait before it releases the mouse button again if no moving the mouse takes place .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking through mouse shift . if this function is enabled , a slow moving to the right and back creates a double click . this moves will be stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ t@@ xt if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started but can be changed later .
if the sound appears delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; to shor@@ ten the response time , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the General tab . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer that lets you adjust to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started at every start from &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to start a program automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the Apply button , the settings will reset to the state after the last pressing of the user .
the best way to do this is to use the pre@@ adjustments . in particular , the smart move should be turned off . if you have become used to the automatic mou@@ sec@@ lick , you can later remove the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response time of &amp; k@@ de ; with sounds .
first of all , you should be aware of where a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not represent a link will not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore use the mouse to park in such places until you want to use them again .
if your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to remove the mouse ball . as it happens , mouse to mouse varies . it should be clear , however , if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would need to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can scra@@ pe you easily with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the smart move in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer end by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you perform a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : when you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another location .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it . but park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to use a keyboard input . thus , accidental moving of mouse clicks can cause unwanted reactions . secure zones for the mouse cursor are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the toolbar and menus and the front lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t make it to edit text .
the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it &apos;s very likely to copy text , copy it to the clip@@ board , or perform any other action you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice :
do not use the smart move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use . select text instead like this : execute a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and clicking again the mouse button .
use the mouse click to listen . this will be used every time &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button will press a sound like a mouse click . later , you will be able to use the smart move even without the mouse click . but this requires some practice .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window needs to be installed , which should already be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is briefly har@@ med . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and who are causing pain to an@@ tigen .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain amount of time waiting for a pulling process to start before releasing the mouse button . this way , drag and drop can also be performed with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that lets silent users let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list of conversation history sentences that are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text passage book . you can select often used text passages from the text passages without having to type them . of course , the text passages can be processed .
on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) , you define the dictionary for the wor@@ d@@ ge@@ ster . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . additionally , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elling words are added to the word tran@@ scription .
the main window at &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and an exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field on the screen shot ) .
when you have setup k@@ mouth ; properly set up , you can enter the sentences in the input field that you want to hear . each spoken phrase is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select sets that are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the side wor@@ d@@ ging and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
enter the command to call the voice generator in the input field of the Fil@@ e- card speech output . in the selection field below the input field , specify the character encoding using the text to pass on to the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed unchanged as standard input to the voice generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your voice generator . this command can be found in the documentation of your voice generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
with possibility to use kt@@ ts@@ d as voice service &amp; k@@ mouth ; first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings will be ignored on this page . kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the Text passage menu or in the bar for text passages .
the selected text passage is directly spoken with the selection of In the input field . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is entered only into the input field .
with the second selection field closing the editing window for text passage book , you can specify whether the text pass@@ book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
when you select a text passage book , the book will be saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text pass@@ book will not be saved . select Save As , &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book is to be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word tran@@ scription . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box when this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop @-@ down box , you can select the currently used dictionary for word completion .
with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books , or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field .
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of each word is simply determined by counting the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; queries then which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary throughout the time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated key short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
actions like new text passages or books add or delete selected text passages and books you can either reach through the selection in the menu bar , toolbar or through a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt keys .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
the selected text will be copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ iry memory .
the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected sets of the exp@@ iry memory .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding toolbar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the toolbar can be placed directly under the editing window under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left and dra@@ gging , the toolbar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is enabled , a narrow bar will be displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar for text passages is displayed with entries . by default , the bar is placed above the editing window directly under the toolbar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left and dra@@ gging , the toolbar can be moved to another location .
you probably have not entered the command for voice output properly or not completely . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the voice output . ( see settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer for more details . )
the festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ isch are supported . the license allows you to use the festival free of charge and without further restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for the voice output setting , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without further restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ et folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following commands :
for the third example , the option must be enabled as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es to a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to de@@ compose the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be app@@ ended . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / ji@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into one line . the option to send data as the default input must be enabled .
the voice output da@@ emon from &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the voice generator settings are only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use the option kt@@ ts@@ d as voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
for setting , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears at &amp; k@@ mouth settings dialog , when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use it successfully , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but this depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with which people who cannot speak can print text by the computer . there is a list of already spoken sentences , which the user can re@@ generate again and again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer is included . a voice syn@@ thesizer has to be installed on the computer .

&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system from &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows any application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmers are ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS abilities .
read texts ( or parts of it ) in the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; even if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications .
speech output is done using the speech speech software program , which uses various background programs such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
enables the creation of language editions on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; help program .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Met@@ a Language ( SM@@ ML ) .

in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database from &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can subscribe to the list via ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / Mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ dump .
before you can use it , you need to install and configure the program speech dispens@@ er .
on the first launch of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the General tab is displayed . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thesi@@ zers offer different languages and voices , as well as various male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple variations for a syn@@ thesizer . an arranged combination of language , syn@@ thesizer , voice , sex , volume and speed should be set up as a speaker .
several speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer lengths for the same printer .
if you click on the tab card speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card card speaker is displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet .
all already configured speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not provide a speaker .
with a click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
select a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boy and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
click here to see the new Spe@@ aker on the Map Guide . to change the settings of this Spe@@ aker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost using . go back to the card general and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to start the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click the jobs tab to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the language delivery system from &amp; k@@ de ; then click the General tab in the General tab to open this tab . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to activate the kt@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the tab card will be displayed and you can create text orders and read it . see . remove the marker , K@@ TT@@ SD will be stopped and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is termin@@ ated , &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue if the box is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears when reading automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears once the pre @-@ reading is completed .
with buttons in this row you can launch , cancel , pause and resume text orders .
with buttons in this row you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board , or open a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be applied to all pages .
the card card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and check the voice output box ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text that is to be read , and select Text from the main menu . after a short time the voice output should begin .
it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ tension@@ ers and other invisible marks are also read .
in &amp; k@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the displayed text . first check , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text that is to be read , and select Text from the main menu .
this also works if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , like &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ No@@ tify is the mess@@ aging system from &amp; k@@ de ; it noti@@ fies you about the events you set up . you can read the text of these messages also by &amp; kt@@ ts ; read more .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program from &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . you can set up &amp; conversation ; for example , set up that you will be notified when a message occurs in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
if a Spo@@ tify is supported , a menu entry will appear in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ No@@ tify vary depending on the application .
string replacement filters provide a good way in &amp; kt@@ ts ; wrong acc@@ ented or incorrect pron@@ ounc@@ ing messages . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is included in the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . you remove the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by e @-@ mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as this can be assumed in most cases as presum@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced features of kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in filters , text is processed before being sent to speech @-@ schedul@@ ers . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation in order to replace incorrect spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain defici@@ encies of voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand how filters work , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other applications and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the continued orders will be continued .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after issuing the warning .
News have the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a web page , you can welcome with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also messages .
the rest are simple text orders . every order you connect from the card card orders is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any special ur@@ gency .
all four order types are executed in queu@@ es except for the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just read such a file , this output is stopped and stopped .
first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there can be even further types of filters .
string replac@@ ements replace parts of a text with other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will allow the creation of chat emo@@ ti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for re@@ format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use a X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . included in the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ S@@ LT files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ML .
with subscri@@ ber selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , if you have set a female voice on the card speaker phone , you can read text from K@@ DE news about it . read more about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter specifies that its rules do not apply , it will pass the text unchanged to the next filter .
when a text assignment , message , warning or a &amp; c@@ de ; -@@ notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters created on the bottom . processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the established regular filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the subsequent setup di@@ alogs will be shown below .
for setting string replacement filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can select this name arbitr@@ arily , it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ ase . the list is processed in the order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save the current list or delete it . upload a list from a file , the entries are app@@ ended from the file to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is only applied when the speaker speaks for the text application one of the languages listed here . click the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages when you click the &amp; C@@ trl key to hold down .
if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID of running programs will be provided with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; you have to om@@ it the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID will copy @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter copies .
the string replacement filter is applied to the text only if all the conditions apply with an entry in the Di@@ esen Filter box if they match . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the ann@@ ot@@ ation filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . so the words must be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual , you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions have been installed , you can call it in the di@@ alo@@ gues add or edit as help for setting these expressions .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ S@@ LT files from one format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such trans@@ formations . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the auxiliary program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the subscri@@ ber selection filter , you can send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card speaker , or to a speaker with certain characteristics . you can , for example , specify that text should be read by a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; passes a text to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the narr@@ ator properties that specify the program that sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker will be able to over@@ write the selected speaker with the subscri@@ ber selection filter .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the regular expression . it is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions are installed , you can click on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
here you specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected , which best meets the desired requirements . click the button on the right to display the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to save or load your voice settings or delete all settings .
the subscri@@ ber selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer can give their applications T@@ TS abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can be used .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API from &amp; k@@ de ; see the complete documentation for both APIs on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d program via the K@@ Spe@@ ech object .
the text of the text to read and the option is a language code like eg &amp; eg ; s , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , enter
open two &amp; console ; -@@ Windows . first launch kt@@ ts@@ d in one window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned speech syn@@ thesi@@ zers are supporting my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have created the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; re @-@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read .
due to an error in festival 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able does not work at all . you have to do that yourself if you don &apos;t use this voice to read web pages . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation characters appear to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ewing g@@ ossi@@ p is spent . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be remedi@@ ed by a string release filter .

the language syn@@ thesi@@ zers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license you will find in the related documentation or on the websites concerned . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package k@@ de@@ bun@@ tu &amp; kt@@ ts ; from it . &amp; kt@@ ts ; find the source code of k@@ de@@ bun@@ n@@ ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
includes many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page ht@@ t@@ p : / / espe@@ ak@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ wah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibiza .
K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer at the supported languages . also check the website of kt@@ ts ; , for information not yet contained in this manual .
speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &apos;s program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to compile &amp; kt@@ ts ; compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages of k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ pat@@ cher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ bris or downloaded the currently created tar@@ ball , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before using your script , first check that speech syn@@ thesizer works properly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of the script used by speech @-@ schedul@@ ers . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g should be developed in such a way that it is possible to set up speech @-@ pat@@ chers directly and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is broken down into single sentences . the user can return to sentence or paragraph style , repeat , stop or cancel the output .
if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female , it will be used , otherwise the best fitting speaker is chosen . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker sel@@ ects , you will see in .
if you click Add a Spe@@ aker on the Add or Add a Spe@@ aker into the list , or click Edit , the Fil@@ e- card Spe@@ aker facility is displayed . as an example , the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . details of the modules can be found here .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PAT@@ H , you just have to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text that is passed to festival . for voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting is done automatically . generally , Western languages like ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , Eastern languages like Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you can adjust volume , speech velocity and pitch of the syn@@ thesi@@ zed language . if you cannot select some controllers and displays them gray , the selected voice will not let you adjust these settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded when starting K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set is syn@@ thesi@@ zed faster ( with bigger memory usage ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet created a speaker ( or forget to click Apply ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be displayed when the program starts . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is marked and not running , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the pre @-@ reading .
here all orders are performed in the queue , along with the application that has set the job , the current status of the job , the number of sets and the currently processed set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column on the card speaker .
with buttons in this row you can proceed or go back in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) .
with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other tabs ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the audio card audio . see also .
here , only text orders are listed and managed . issues of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information about the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; see .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled or frac@@ t@@ ted without support for the appropriate audio module ; it cannot load the required libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select here the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the unit speed here . 50@@ .00 ; % matches about half and 200@@ .00 ; % about twice normal talk speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to apply the new settings for running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of the AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you have to find out which device works with you . in case of doubt , select Standard .
on this tab , you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text assignment is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other applications and holds these orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the reserved orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that talks messages . if you can read &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can see with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the room .
if a text job is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , it adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special promotions for messages , warnings and the output of screen readers if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ No@@ tify &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click al@@ erts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check this check box to enable &amp; k@@ de read@@ mission ; if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications where a sound is played is by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sends whenever someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .

the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . in addition , brands for controlling the pron@@ unciation of abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following limitations are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the default voice that the festival uses in the edition of SS@@ ML .
if the speed or pitch settings in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ p@@ 2 % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds split text into single phrases . this can start &amp; kt@@ ts ; faster with pre @-@ reading , since only the first set must be syn@@ thesi@@ zed , not the whole text order . this allows you to skip or stop orders on the card card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer doesn &apos;t support this directly .
here you see the set limit detection filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; a set limit detection filter is set up automatically as a default . you can change its settings or add additional set limit detection filters , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker selection by selecting . turn on the selection selection and enter the text to read . switch on the selection of the speakers , change some properties and check the way the speaker is selected . of course , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then you can start faster with pre @-@ reading , since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take very long ,
you can then pause or stop orders on the card card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer doesn &apos;t support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set limit detection filter is set automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set limit recognizable filter text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional phrases and add a tab character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab characters are automatically removed before filtering out of the text ) . note that the standard set @-@ limit detection filter retains the punc@@ tu@@ ation .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal set @-@ limit recognizable filter , you can insert it again by rel@@ o@@ ading the default _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
you can over@@ write the subscri@@ ber settings for the application on the tab card selection . the card card will be displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top of the card speaker ) . in other words : no speaker properties are specified .
use of the most appropriate speaker with all the characteristics of an established speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; select this speaker . otherwise , select the speaker that best matches the originally set characteristics .
select the method to enter the desired language parameters by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the characteristics of the desired speaker . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , don &apos;t enter anything .
mark this check box if the property should take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set multiple markers here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only case you may want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one in the working environment .
to use all properties in the Spe@@ aker section , which is best to delete the following , click on the default comment button and then use the speaker that matches the following .
in this case 0 stands for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( no order number is required , the input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr cras@@ hes when it is started . I compiled debu@@ gging support but I do not get any trac@@ eability .
Stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; it was finished . you probably need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved by this , a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed . you can try updating or un@@ installing G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output over AL@@ SA does not work if I play music with another application at the same time . if I hold a text job , it freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; a message appears which states : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
there is a problem in your system that conflicts with AL@@ SA will occur which prevent simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . please refer to the website of the AL@@ SA @-@ project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I loaded an extra voice for the festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr shows this voice not .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ net / Vo@@ ices . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers .
on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . for this to work , the program must be so@@ x installed and be discover@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thesizer modules such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed itself on the card for subscri@@ ber setup . depending on the selected voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ reads . ( this is because HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) Dis@@ able either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are very brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML form@@ er@@ filter , and set up the speech speed .
I don &apos;t make it that websites are read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival narr@@ ator , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; read the websites with a male voice .
at festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the Tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . in order for the festival to produce no mistakes , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added an own character set filter and now I can proceed in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more batch pre@@ - or reset . on the tab orders will be displayed , the job exists only from one set . what am I doing wrong ?
you are not allowed to filter punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead , use a filter for character limit detection for these characters .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesi@@ zers whose source code is exposed . the quality of the voices is generally good and multiple voices and languages are supported . with many voices you can adjust volume , speech velocity and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you need to install at least one language . help you find the instructions that are delivered with the festival . if you want to let websites read , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions in passing on .
this voice requires 1.@@ 95 beta or new . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone for the voices . select a Cy@@ ri@@ lli@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , look for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you wish to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech language , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ lli@@ c like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; syn@@ thesizer . then the festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full language delivery system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ f@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phone . Festival creates these from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German texts di@@ phone . more information can be found here .
for this process additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed at the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .org ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K menu contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .com ; package was designed to allow the users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .com@@ . create a simple interface for the user :
after the installation , a new module network settings are displayed at &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ .com@@ . ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in the &amp; K@@ Menu ; start .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .org ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured in a functional way , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .com@@ . The device is even indicating and setting the network properties possible .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the Network Set@@ ting option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when the module network settings are started , this module attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be identified , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which best matches the distribution and the rel@@ a@@ as@@ est@@ and . by selecting the setting non @-@ re @-@ issues , the definition can be made permanently . the next start of the network settings will then automatically pres@@ et this selection .
changing the network settings is only possible in the system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , click the button of the system management mode at the lower end of the module . it is required to enter the password .
the entire functionality of the module is available in the system management mode . it is divided into three tabs :
the tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be carried out by the tab &apos;s network interfaces :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up in the list by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button ... in the Device Dialog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advanced Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button shows the dialog with further options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the automatic mode sel@@ ects the TCP / IP settings from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out at the same time with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start . in the selective list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , can be selected .
the TCP / IP configuration can be set with the Select manual without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . the desired TCP / IP address must be specified in the IP address field . in the net@@ mask input field , the sub@@ net mask must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as the characteristics of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switching on an out@@ dated network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on interface ....

if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a host with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will resolve this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution machine part of the name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be sorted in the priority list by selecting an entry and drop down or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list of buttons .
by clicking the Add ... button , a DNS server can be added from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first , you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select an entry and then click Edit .... It displays the Edit dialog .
the list of names known to name specifies host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the list of names known to name contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this still contained in the test is intended to replace version 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the known host and click Add .... Add New Ali@@ as dialog will be shown .
enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known computer has multiple alias names , press the Add button multiple times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a name known to name from the list and select Edit .... The dialog Modi@@ fy Calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of the static hosts .
the settings made in the Network Set@@ ting module are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes , you need to set the following command in a &amp; Con@@ sole ;
the homepage from &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .com@@ . is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the pre@@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; install with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .com@@ . The following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second section all of the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .com@@ . changeable configuration files will be discussed .
this section does not replace any further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC can be conveyed into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently using TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found a wide distribution . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . therefore , this description is currently focusing on the common IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; Work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact point to use a valid IP address or , if available , DH@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a range reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , so any use is possible .
of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , mostly addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the default route is required for IP forwarding .
the net address 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed loop .
this section contains the configuration files specified by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .com@@ . and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed with DSL connections so it won &apos;t be surprised if there &apos;s another content found there in case of active DSL connections .

as with the creation of new variables , changes will only be made when the c@@ ron@@ tab has been saved .
to cut a variable , first select the variable to be removed . then go to Edit .
to copy an environment variable , first select the variable to be copied . then go to Edit copying .
alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the variable and select Copy , or press C@@ trl ; C .
to insert an environment variable , first one has to be cut or copied to the clip@@ board . only then the option Inclu@@ des is available at all . select the variable folder . then go to Edit .
to change a variable , first select the variable to edit . then go to Edit Chan@@ ges .... Altern@@ atively , you can click with the right mouse button on the variable and change ... or you press C@@ trl ; O . then the dialog box appears , in which you can edit the variable as described above .
to delete an environment variable , first select the variable . then go to Edit delete .
to enable or de@@ activate an environment variable , select it and set the state with the Edit Activ@@ ate menu item . with a de@@ activated variable , De@@ activate is displayed .
alternatively , you can also right @-@ click on the variable and select Activ@@ ate . make sure the name and value of the variables are displayed correctly .
if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or changed , you still need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . select the Save File menu item to do so .
alternatively , you can press C@@ trl ; S . changes or additions to tasks or variables will become active only then .
it appears the default node ; -@@ Print dialog . if you select un@@ folds , you will see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog .
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who own advanced permissions .
cr@@ on , for example , vi@@ x@@ ie cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to modify the schedules of the user .
a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from and UNIX to learn time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar that offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective packing . the second purpose was to answer a question my wife asked : how much longer does it take to secure ?
before a tape can be used it must be mounted by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; re@@ trains the tape and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . detects and dat ; the pre @-@ credits on the tape do not , you will be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
recognis@@ es &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ credits , it searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be created anew .
if everything goes smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive is changed to indicate that the tape is mounted . in the Status bar a corresponding message appears . the volume of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; there is a change in the symbol for the tape to detect that the connection for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ;
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can use it to save data . this process does not conform to format@@ ting with &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not conform to format@@ ting , before you can format a tape before being used . floppy @-@ tape drives usually require format@@ ting of the tape , while DA@@ T drives do not require format@@ ting .
after entering the band name and the capacity , the tape continues , with the format of the tape . all data on the tape are lost . after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically mounted and ready for use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured , which can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a security profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup has been started , the Save dialog opens . in this dialog , you can again check the selected files and change the backup settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you have confirmed the settings , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Backup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialog appears . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the time remaining . &quot; &quot; &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
once the scan process has been started , the dialog appears for review . in this dialog , you can review your selection again and change the working folder for the review .
if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears . this dialog displays the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can initiate the restore , you need to mark the files that are to be recovered . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rec@@ over from the menu .
once the recovery process has been started , the Rest@@ ore dialog will appear . in this dialog , you can review your selection again and change the restore folder for restoration .
if you have confirmed the restore settings , the Rest@@ ore dialog will appear . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and time remaining .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file by means of the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index in two ways :
this creates a security profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , it is true that only the files located in it are backed up on the same fil@@ esystem as the folder . folders that are on other file systems can be registered separately under backup files . each entry will be considered by tar independently of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files were not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape device .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; dat ; before the tape is mounted , the command mt load to the drive . for some drives , this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; block the ej@@ ection at the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work for all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , the tape will automatically be ki@@ cked off when releasing &amp; k@@ dat ; the tape will automatically be ki@@ cked off . do not use this option on floppy disks .
if the option is on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; change the hardware @-@ based block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive .
when &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , where the host@@ name is the complete name of the system on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the epoch in which the tape has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which let themselves be administr@@ ated directly with the GNU ; - tar . even other tar -@@ versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a tape . this icon is only active when a tape is mounted .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ logs provides quick access to information about problems encountered on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your system . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; experienced users allow quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; therefore try to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated .
the current version 0.@@ 4.1 contains &amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; a number of useful functions . this includes among others :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the screen@@ shot below , &amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; functions are available , with which the single protocol lines of a log file can easily be filtered and sorted . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after launching , &amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will not be shown to you , and it will open instead of having a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely you will not have permission to read under Linux in the / var / log folder where normal users usually have no permissions to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or after entered strings . add a string to the filter bar . the list of the log lines will now be automatically displayed , so that only log lines will be displayed next to the filter . then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns .
you can of course also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the protocol file system protocol , select the column process , and also enter the name of a process in the filter bar , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color as protocol lines of level indicator . the color display of protocol lines can be switched off setup dialog .
if you want to display only certain processes ( for example in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
you can also activate the Add to New Lines option in the main window context menu to display all new log @-@ lines added .
&amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; allows you to display multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a report from the menu to display .
&amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; has a website dedicated to ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more up @-@ to @-@ date information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ logs .

welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the system V In@@ it is rapidly becoming the standard for the control of the program start when bo@@ oting the system in the Linux world . and this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD In@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without installing a new installation and re@@ format@@ ting . Linux ; the kernel first looks under / etc after an in@@ it file . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service you want to start when you boot up the system or when you switch to another running level . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is started only once . such calls go to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be located in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something with the serial port when bo@@ oting .
the kernel looks in@@ it at different places after the program and starts the first one it finds .
the default running level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see in the initial area a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is 3 . if you want to change this , you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have confused something , then you can repair it by rest@@ art@@ ing the system and doing the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop . you can actually run these scripts manually on the command line like this :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script will be called with the stop stop . if it contains an S , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server running level that only runs ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user running level , that &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program has been created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six running levels to start ( or stop ) at this level .
you can also move scripts between level level@@ s or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . this is done only if they extract an entry from the area of available system services .
note : entries will be moved if you drag them to a new range . in order to simply copy them to a new Run@@ level , you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry previously existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the tr@@ ash bin . be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the various work@@ spaces ( available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry to another Run@@ level , move it to the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired Run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to reject the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ time level@@ n , and now the machine boots up constantly . what can I do ?
enter lin@@ ux single on the LI@@ LO prompt and press the input key to start in the single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default running level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for exec@@ uting under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services in these distri@@ butions are started simplifies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check that all configuration files are available that are required by the system service ( and whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) can be quit easily if their configuration files are not available or mis@@ configured .
the meaning of Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even vary from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that they can be attached to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the custom@@ ization of &amp; k@@ user ;
after you have made changes , you must save it . either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the Save In menu item .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user and the user groups list . for editing , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the User - or Group Charac@@ ter@@ istics dialog .
some flash@@ cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings . only if you have limited space constraints ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card is created where you can set individual settings . additional card cards appear , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Unix .
the card password management will appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Unix .
this card only appears if there is a limited file system ( quot@@ a ) enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with the limitation of space constraints in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected using the field file system with space limitation
the card card groups inform about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group , which the user belongs to , can be found in the Pri@@ mary group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the Group &apos;s Properties dialog contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select that user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate add button on the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user respectively the selected group works an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module you can install the boot manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot of the default operating system , add the default operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more .
