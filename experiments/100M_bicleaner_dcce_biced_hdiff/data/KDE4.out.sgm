<seg id="1">"" "the module" "" "translate website" "" "can be found in the" "" "& konqueror" "" "menu under Extras Web Site. select the source and target language of the translation from the drop-down list." ""</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated at the point of the whole & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is very rudimentary. in the best case babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, translations should not make important decisions without verifying the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated by yourself on the Babelfish page, where you can insert translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package and package; contains different modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some extra features and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making them readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">For more information on how to use & konqueror; and the built-in functions refer to & konqueror manual.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Setting extensions... Open the tab card tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard setup modules from the kde; addons. please note that if you have additional software installed, you may have more modules installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; it contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & konqueror; click Tools Cancel. then you can view the page that has brought & konqueror; crash, or delete the list of crashes if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The panel filter (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras View filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display begins with the root knot of the document, for example: documentItem, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views, in order to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The feature of & FSView is to graphically display nested folder hierarchies with the help of a tree map. tree-Maps indicates the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose area is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the child objects is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView, the size is the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files, even then easily recognized when it is located far down in the folder hierarchy. consequently, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you will be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap representation is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over view color mode can either display depth for easy recognition of the nesting depth or the mapping of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the respective file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display, or whether the area of subordinate rectangles should be used (whereby, therefore, display errors can be determined by constraints on the character of the Treemap). in addition, you can specify the relative position of the label in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">With representation algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be maintained that the area is proportional to the size of the item. with the Treemap in & FSView; this goal is not always complied with. it will draw frames to avoid the nesting of entries. note that less space for the frame is lost when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As division of the area of an entry for the subordinate entries takes place, the implementation is left up. here, it is necessary for the labeling and avoidance of space losses through frame always advantageous to divide the rectangles that are as square as possible. the best methods in this respect are rows, columns or recursive branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry via the menu item View Log in area. instead, a space pattern is drawn into the area of the parent item to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally was & FSView; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget developed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Picture Gallery module can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras Picture Gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you view the Picture Gallery module, a dialog opens which allows you to define the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The option title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option images per line has a slider and a rotation panel to adjust the number of thumbnails of each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">The file name of the image indicates whether the file names are shown in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the checkbox File size of the image, specify whether the file size is displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the image size check box, specify whether the size of the images is displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the dialog Folder you specify where the gallery will be saved and which sub-folders should be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the file selection Save in HTML file, specify where to save the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="32">To include the subfolder check box, you can set a slider or a rotary panel to which level the subfolders will be included.</seg>
<seg id="33">With the check box original pictures, you will be able to copy if the original pictures should be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Use the comment file checkbox to specify a comment file for capturing images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own colour depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; Settings gives you easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & konqueror; -menu under Extras HTML settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the & konqueror; display menu under the navigation pane or with the key shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the navigation pane of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to listen to media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Changing browser detection adds a menu entry in & konqueror, which allows you to change browser and operating system recognition for single domains. this is helpful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser recognition of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser, change browser recognition in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the password in MSIE for pages that reject access with browsers on the basis of mozilla. for example, you need MSIE browser recognition to access the & konqueror and hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not comply with the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identifier of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the default browser detection is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry Setup... you can set the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; module check your & CSS; style sheets and & HTML; documents in accordance with W3C's recommendations and other standards.</seg>
<seg id="47">Check the website of the website in the & konqueror; Check menu under Extras's website. you can make the following tests:</seg>
<seg id="48">With the & HTML; check if your & HTML; document of the syntax of & HTML; corresponds to all found errors are displayed. with this review you can make sure your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Allows you to check your & CSS; style sheets included in a & HTML; - or & XHTML; document. with valid & CSS, your web pages have a uniform appearance regardless of the browser used.</seg>
<seg id="50">Check the links on your site on further lines and erroneous links. recursively all links are checked on the website.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here you specify the addresses of the servers for the verification of your & HTML; documents and & CSS; style sheets.</seg>
<seg id="52">With the module Web-Archivierer for & konqueror; you can save web pages with text and images in .file format.</seg>
<seg id="53">Click on Tools Website with the mouse and a dialog appears to save the displayed web page.</seg>
<seg id="54">The module Web-Archiver is copyright & copy; 2001-2003 Andreas Schlappbach, Antonio Larossa and Malte Starostik dorpbch @ iam.unibe.ch larossa @ kde.org malte @ kde.org</seg>
<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface will be provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digipack; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphot2 library. of course, each medium and any card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digitized; work together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digiplug; includes fast image editing with basic image processing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE image plugin interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digiplug; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion with libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, like & eg; via the camera or the lens to be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also digitized; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. therefore, you should report problems and possibilities for improvement.</seg>
<seg id="60">& nbsp; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains an entry problems or requests.... This opens a dialog with an underlined link. if you use these links, your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system. all required information is already entered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digicode; is a project that is supported by a community. if you are a regular user of & digiplug; if you are a regular user of & digipist; then we would like to ask you questions to other users of & digiplug; and hopefully soon you will be able to answer questions from other users. in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicode; visit homepage to find news about released versions and other information about & digiplug; learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to participate & digitized; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for registering in the developer mailing list by & digimaster;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start digging; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database. you can specify a local, remote or removable folder. simply enter a path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here the datasheet will be saved. this path will remain the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digiplug; will also use as an Albenbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains images as the base folder. & Edit; view each subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed. during the search of the folder you will get a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digiplug; duress recursively the library path in its entirety. you cannot exclude sub-folders except it iste in hidden folder. you can do this by inserting an item in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as base folders, you will notice that the albums in My Albenites do not have photos as icons. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, you can also handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Menu Help.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up and work with raw files is described in the Roh Decodersettings and Roh workflow sections.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface will be provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digipack; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphot2 library. of course, each medium and any card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digitized; work together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera then appears as a disk device. the connection can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digicode; uses the gPhoto2 program to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transfers over the serial port slowly, this connection is now outdated. & digiplug; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphot2 has to be created with libexif support so that the thumbnails of digiKam can be read reliably. if the exif support is not present in libgphot2, you may not see thumbnails or the creation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things on & digiplug; is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE image plugin interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digiplug;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules for all graphic programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as a user can do. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digiplug; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes in & digicode; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop images functions anywhere: you can lay a picture in another part of the tree, over the horizontal dividing line or into another application window. the only restriction is that an image cannot be placed in keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, raw, movies and audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. so the filter on the file name will only work if this ind symbol view is also displayed. which fields are displayed you can configure in the dialog of the Albenites.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlisteg; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos stored by & digipack are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the AlbenProperties or after the date on which the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. choose to scan album Import pictures. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop there. in the then appearing menu you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. you can also move or copy several photos in the same way. simply select all photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, you must click with the right mouse button on the album and edit album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album- Collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can group together under a common name. the collection you set will be used to sort your photos by selecting the collection from the toolbar or selecting albums Up collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the collections for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: used when you sort your albums by date with View albums By date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons eldest, average, new: these set the date to the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. this will first attempt to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last modification of each file in this folder will be used instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first open an album in & digip; open, the first image in the album will be selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, you must click the image with the right mouse button and select Add as album preview. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to place it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be contained in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digiimportantly; support the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list on the bottom left of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window provides you with the main view of your photos. when you select an album, all images are displayed in this album in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of these thumbnails with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you have to wait a bit while the preview images are generated. you can avoid using any preview images in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information for each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview. what information is available can be changed via Edit Controls; set up the albums page and customize the thumbnail area to suit your needs.</seg>
<seg id="99">The preview images have help windows, which appear when you leave the mouse pointer for a moment over a picture. the help displays the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all you need at & digipack. albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these. you can view all the features that come with & digitised; you can choose between viewing the images, slide show or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by either selecting F4 Image Edit... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing... you will find a guide on how to edit your photos. with the image editing, you can view your photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & Edit - the functionality you need is not provided. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub-menu of Open. for this, and how to customize it to your needs, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing, other image processing programs may cause problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digiplug; provides two options for rotation. the easiest is to click with the right mouse button on the preview and select Rotate. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, you can click the preview with the right mouse button and select F2 Rename from the context menu. keep in mind that you maintain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & digip; delete it, it will be moved to the garbage bin of & kde; move F8 image Delete or Del If you prefer to really delete it, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The view & quot; My date slidesks; organizes your photos based on the data. & digicode; uses either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date aperture at the bottom of the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords add a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers, which can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search again.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos that have been tagged with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keyword listeeg; work together so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. so you can also use your keywords in other programs. in addition, the keywords are re-imported when the database is lost once & digitized; the images will be noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking on & quot; My keyword "; or click on an existing keyword and select a new keyword. if you add a new keyword, after clicking on an existing keyword, this keyword will be the keyword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired location in the tree and put it there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can only be one time in the tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting keyword processing in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, you must click the image with the right mouse button and set it in the context menu as an album preview. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to place it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To use the functionality with keywords, you first need to apply your photos with keywords. this can be done in two ways: once you have selected the photos you selected by a keyword, you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword "; alternatively, you can click the preview of the images and select the keyword (s) from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can designate a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way you can set a keyword for each person in a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event at which it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have a photo with keywords, this will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword by using the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select Remove from the Tags menu. the menu only displays the keywords you have assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view displays a timeline-dependent histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved over this histogram. to select a time frame, click on the bottom rectangle of the selection box that displays the time unit. this displays all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. it will appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">If you click here, the filter will be deleted and all the images will be displayed again. if the search has not found anything, then the lamp will be red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this, you can save a simple search box such as the one described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as a search key. after you have saved it, it appears in the list.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are happy with your selection, press the head OK and the search is done. the results are used in the View My search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection once again, you just need to select the corresponding entry from the view My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you select to edit search, the search form will appear again with the search information entered previously. if you select to edit as advanced search, the dialog will appear for the advanced search to change your previous search. here you will find more rules for searching. for more information, see the Advanced Search Tool.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete the Search list from the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">Advanced Search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters that you can search for in certain fields of & digi.s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the AlbenDatabase. all rules are added in line, by operators. an option can be added to this list with search group / search group added or deleted. each option can be associated with others about the logical operations All..., A..., No... or At least...</seg>
<seg id="132">& digitization; characterized by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows images to compare by comparing these signatures. the lesser the difference between two image signatures, the more they match. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop each picture to find a similar one. if you push a picture from somewhere over the icon of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free-hand color sketch: draw a quick sketch and sketch; find the matching pics. here too, a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it and move it. move Ctrl; left mouse button to drag a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below, you can specify a name for your geo filter. this will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a Live Geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digiplug; provides a luminous table in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Add to the luminous table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the light table and its window open. if you are back in & digitized; main window, you can quickly open the light table with L Extras illuminated table.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview panel, you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you want to synchronize the preview from the toolbar and carry a zoo and / or move operations on one of the images, then they will be able to compare the same area of the two images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images. if you navigate from the toolbar, then the two first images will automatically be loaded into the compartments. use the left mouse button at any preview image to see it in the right pane. this makes it easy to work through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal soldering actions also work directly from the lighting console like F4 File Edit....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right side of the main window is available in the light table for both thumbnails. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows. to pivot the visible area of the image, you must click it and hold the & LMB. in the Preview mode both images will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zoom factor works just like in other views. just use the zoom slider below the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom in. this happens in both images when you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital stock management - away from the modem? digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage. each of the photos captures, scans or digital photos leads through a form of digital inventory management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up, find, protect and use your photos. we focus on the procedures for digital photographers the & digiplug; we focus on downloading, renaming, removing, grouping, securing, assessing, archiving, optimising, waiting and exporting image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management takes up, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transforms, confeces and exports the content that has a monetary or cultural value.</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data on data. metadata is, in accordance with your definition, data that provide information about or a documentation of other data administered by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you don't even need to find a specific photo without inventory management. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then you definitely don't use & digiplug;. the approach to save the metadata in both a database and image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving on which you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide if you want to have other access to your photos, whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure that you have to switch to a larger drive sometime.</seg>
<seg id="151">You may be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times at the same location. if you do enough photos, then you will use subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, work procedures, constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% Archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? separating file types makes batch processing easier. separate new ones from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option to store metadata in the Edit page of the metadata in & Edit. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item from the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? to do so & digiplug; to them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, as you should now assign keywords, captions and a rating to any photo. of course, you can select all images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense, as you can focus on the best photos during the further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's proceed with keywords, keywords, as you do with other programs, or continue categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import catalogued images from another source with embedded key words, then & digiplug; automatically build the tree for you or place the images in the right place. sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by dragging a subtree to another. the changed keywords are edited by & digipack; updated as it tracks the sub-trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The diagram shows how different metadata is overlapped. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata consists of many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool for cataloguing your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most people don't want to let anyone see your photos, you want to share them with your friends, family, photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you that this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you begin to dream, have associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who look at your photos the title may be more important than the image itself to generate an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is ok if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a caption for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug; you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as caption. you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time. KDE even exports them to the caption and / or the title of the Web-gallery system. so you don't have to tell the story a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the time before GPS? when you had to go to another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet from Google Earth? well, because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now drives with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of using geolocation are innumerable and will be deeper in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually duplicate your trips by using images with geographical information. & digiplug; can also export kml files that you can use with Google Earth. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the Google Maps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice to use copyrights in order to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, i.e. also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information on the installation page of & digiplug; as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer, for example, the name of a company or organization can be used. once this value has been saved, it should no longer be changed. this field does not support commas or semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title: linked to the author. this field contains the photographer's job title. examples of this can be title: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note to the author field, it must be filled in as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for provider): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here, which offers the picture to others. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group / agency that offers the picture here is given here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright-sections, although they do not provide protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify this in the image. for private persons this is only of little interest for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digitization; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failures, disk failure, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster prevention, life time, temperature, data size, spread aberration</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section we discuss problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery firm, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, these precautions have to be handled and you may not buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold-coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable. so it's about selecting the right one.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if you have just been written. that's why they use a checksum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CD and DVD, there is a convenient program called IsoBuster that seems to work miracles in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux, but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs appear to capture the format war against the HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Slowly burn with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-propriate format. also read the media with a description, date & author marks and then store in a clean, dark dry and protected place protected from animals. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk makers keep your statistics for themselves. their manufacturer warrants include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives: disk error study</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: disks are the longest to operate in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In case of lower temperatures, the error rate increases dramatically. electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of failure. SMART notifies the imminent failure.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power loss before you have saved the files, but these losses can usually be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices do not account much, this is different for devices with computer chips and high speed processors. these can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause locked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed Motherboards and other defects. thus, protect yourself from the unavoidable thing resulting in a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs some of the energy slots and grounding the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in strip.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also make sure that it provides protection against lightning strike and thus protects the connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should also ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected. some manufacturers also provide overvoltage contactors which also have a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically supply battery energy when a power failure occurs. this gives you the opportunity to store your data and keep the system down. if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and and compare its security in case of current disturbances with the costs to avoid this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can take you up to & euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it. finally, you should always remember all cables before you drive on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can mount it as a drive on & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared storage is another popular offer where you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are, however, very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo Community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are limited to photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your images available in full resolution online. the professional version will provide you more in case of Flickr dramatically. for $25 per year you get unlimited storage, which should be verified in reality first.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data security, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and for large companies it is included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are vulnerable to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst part is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you one day open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise. no one seems to have ever thought about it. no one seems to have ever thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way of data than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal filesystems these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of bugs a year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS by Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk errors at low levels and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard on a GPL compatible license. we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux; and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms that ZFS uses and is also available for Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% of the workstation systems. for notebooks, the proportion of thefts is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to less damage than for example theft or reinstallation. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no one has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFs, and XFS to name the most common file systems. a very good English article can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden interruption during surgery is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human errors are the major causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Digital cameras sensors are 1-2 lens settings away from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards 10 megapixel levels. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixel. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixel. for higher resolutions, you need a full-size sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive you get today for 100 & euro; so don't make anyone responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by data loss every year. so, secure your data after a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous as the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a lightning strikes you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget aeroplanes: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous enough for your data. they normally concern a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or something like that.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as said above, a common cause of data loss despite backup is panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot of two time points: that of the complete backup and that of the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. generates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such backup was made. this backup comes next with the exception that it is only scanned and not ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transferring scripts rsync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Back up important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure lets you have enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should happen manually after you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, IPTC stored in the image file, associated XMP files, retain original, memory, scalability, media, reinventing images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., use of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">For valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider and re-evaluate all that is said today. unfortunately, there is no other way to be considered a certain vigilance. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the fewer variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone today. so if you have an old system that is important for reading your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for future use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the print expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability and the area you want to increase the area you want to increase on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and relocate it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new disk was detected by the system, but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb, the new record is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of row if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open Source Standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can read it, you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was designed as an open source standard that should replace GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can recommend gamma- and chromaticity data for improved color assignment in heterogeneous platforms. this format we would recommend to you to save your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format is adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a license-free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers already provide DNG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why in 2001, Adobe introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Image resource blocking quot; -Technology of the 90s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format. XMP fits this because it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when you link between the metadata file and the image file and as mentioned above, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compliant online metadata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modelling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and DCMI working groups, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera editing, you can use it as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine editing you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with Edit Edit, then you should add the metadata again. these were possibly cut off from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the copyrighted images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them only then in web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digitized; in section Add a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your allocate database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use, connect these to the computer, turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is established, a Fertig Indicator will appear at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will be displayed. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for your view will be displayed for each file, photos, movies, music, etc on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the sidebars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab metadata displays the internal metadata such as exif, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as the metadata side bar from the main window of & digiplug; or image editing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is by clicking on the Download button and then downloading the selection of All. this invites all the photos from their camera to a single album in & digiplug;. downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were downloaded safely into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can only select the desired one with the standard selection methods from & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download it Selected. download the selected button until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New Download is available. these images have not yet been downloaded from & digiplug; in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you select this option, of course, only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you want to download or download the selected buttons, a dialog box will appear with which you can select the destination album in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Albums tab. then select the destination album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digiplug; download the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by deleting the Delete all. if you want to delete only a few, you need to select them first and then delete the selected delete.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera. the photos will not be moved to the garbage dump of & kde; so you should check carefully if the photos have been successfully deleted from the camera before you delete them from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera viewfinder, you should do so via the camera menu, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras often do not use particularly meaningful names for the photos. the file names are normally used again after the photos are deleted from the camera. this can result in duplicate file names if you upload photos of different recording studios into the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time the image was made into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for file-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder per day will be created automatically.</seg>
<seg id="263">The Options During the transfer opens three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two affect the data about the author in the section Standard Autoridentity. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you prefer a different date format than the standard format, you can use the prefix photo-% y-% d% H:% M:% S in the editing field. turn on the date & time option. for further adjustments you should read the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera filename option, you have the option to change the file names in lowercase. or capital letters if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, that & digiplug; used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview. your settings for renaming will be stored and automatically used when you open the camera window for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digiplug; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during download. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata page, you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually turned on, and if your camera doesn't deliver this information, & digiplug; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off automatic rotation, use the Advanced button and select the Automatic rotation in the bottom area of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera provides information about the date the photo is made available, & digiplug; this is used to automatically download sub-albums in the target album while downloading. all images with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information. in the Meta data section, you can read which information your camera might have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually turned off, and in this case it stores & digiplug; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn on this option. use the Advanced button and select the Date Based Manage option at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files you want to upload. you can also select more than one file with the default & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the picture selection is done, queries & digiplug; you where the images should be uploaded. a folder selector dialog for the camera appears. select the folder you want and press OK to start uploading. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a generic term in this document. this means a position that is indicated in length and width grading and which can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser that shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digipack; users who want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as the direction, semitrailites and map references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, over a post-processing of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical mapping (manual) and last by manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit. but there are a few working with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save this data in the gpx format, since this is the only format supported by the geo-mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for and Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and the GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with Phil Harvey's ExifTool. it uses the accidentals of hairy coordinates, such as maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show European maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, showing all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digiplug; try to give you so much control over his work procedures as possible. there are many settings that the behavior of & digiplug; change. to access these settings, you need to customize the Edit menu. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be set on embedded preview or start image editing. you can set the default behavior of & digiplug; specify when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written to the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for author: this field should contain the professional name of the photographer. this can be designations such as employed photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to indicate the picture that the photo offers. this does not have to be the author, if this is for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here as this is the image of others & quot; ano. quot;. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group or agency that provides the image will be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions save the data to the corresponding IPTC rims. this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of & digi.This metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in & digicode; imported without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image captions as embedded labeling (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the pictures. this allows your captions to be read by other image viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse pointer rests in the main window over a file. depending on the option selected, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digiplug; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digicode can be displayed, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. any file in one & digip; album folder that has none of these extensions will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings again by pressing the Refresh button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The lighting console's settings can be set to the default values on this page. however, each time you open the luminous table these settings will be turned on if possible. however, some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. if you have one, then you can get better viewing results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can disable the toolbar if you use the image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark and light color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in the image processing, this View Mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-Subsampling it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for more information.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the png compression you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG uses a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression. this means a low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option to compress TIFF files, you can disable the Defllate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no effect on image quality since the Defllate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss-free JPEG 2000 files, you can save loss-free. even if you select the lossy setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in ordinary JPEG. when this paragraph is written, metadata was not yet supported but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of Edit & Edit, image editing was just a picture viewer for photos. currently, it rapidly develops into a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the image editing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default assumption is that all green pixels are the same. if the bright green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light, this difference creates a lattice pattern in the output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option draws the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera will be used. otherwise, if set, the auto colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the spotlights, so the parts of your images that are burned in due to the inability of your camera to catch the spotlights as a passing white. use the setting colors to trigger some unusual results as it shows the pointed lights in various rose oil. lastly, you can try some parts of the missing information from the top-lights to reconstruct.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels are generally not so fast saturating like green and red. & nbsp; and dcraw try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the yet unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option reconstruct, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the & digipack; image processing. to keep the time for the Demosathing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo-icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& nbsp; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks like this. VNG interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. it generates color artefacts on the edges. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for color grading correction, as it is performed during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to return it. there is also LCMS and & digiplug; information on how to translate color information from one color space to the other, so that the colors are as exact as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior issues when an image is opened in image editing / Color handling module with raw files start.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile folder Set the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you save all your profiles. & digiplug; examine this folder then during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have here the ability & quot; default squot; for your profiles to be stored. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your pictures are color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain any color tapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw gamma doesn't correct for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to perform the color mapping by yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft Proof profile that you can emulate on how your image would be returned from a device. this is very useful before you print picture, because your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated. this could be manually corrected instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obviously what color profile is intended for. unfortunately not with the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course, this answer is unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension provides the style for the finish: F for an exact style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by providing this interface, & digiplug; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use, and these will then be loaded by & digiplug; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings brief commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) about KIPI modules, you can get the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The slide show settings should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera characteristics show on the left a list of all the currently supported cameras. on the right-hand side there is a button Automatic detection which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, turned on and in the image display mode.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom, you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) -mass storage cameras. this field will only be active if you have a USB- or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you will need to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / port, on which you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & digiplug; automatically detect the camera. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the main window of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option Converting dialog for moving &gt; Show pictures in the trash bin, you can set the dialog from & Edit; when you delete a photo in an album, you will find more details when deleting a photo and deleting an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly executed by & digiplug; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without any queries. otherwise, you must save the changes using the button change.</seg>

<seg id="337">& digiplug; includes fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and for correction and improvement. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or from the context menu of the Preview and Selection of the Ads / Editing item.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digipack; so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules, see Setting Up Image Processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, the magnification factor and the current image size indicate.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most needed functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image editing change your photos. none of the functions will change the original photo before you have saved file saving or the button Save from the toolbar. note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you might need to make a copy of your image before changing it. you can save it with file Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Recover menu or using the button Recover of the image editing button in the toolbar. you will then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any image processing action can be undone or restored. you can undo the last action by selecting Edit, Restore or Restore by selecting Edit Recover from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, use the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to remember.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; by pressing the return or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer, you will get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be undone or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo in and out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: automatically select the magnification factor</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you come to the normal view in which you use the Esc key. if you do not want this, you can change it in the Edit dialog by & Edit. you can view it from the Edit dialog. see the section for setting up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select the Print Image from the File menu and get the default & kde; Print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sets. whole picture pages can be printed out of your choice. you just need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the Album "Export Response Assistant. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The Edit & Edit; main window has a side bar at the right edge that provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation arrows, even in the image processing. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear again.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied to the EXIF- and IPTC fields so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are inverted. if you want to use the IPTC label field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, the captions will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">There is a button next to the Apply button. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done when you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The evaluation section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field Urgency. the encoding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword overview shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the keyword used previously in this & digitised session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is a further relief in the input of keywords in a series of images. if you have entered different keywords, they will be saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the corresponding check boxes in the tree. all keywords in an image are stored in the keyword keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main screen and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not on the entire selection, if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please refer to the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The Keyword Keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar is used with their album, - date, keyword and search views. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right-hand side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and discard keywords. suppose you have selected several images in the main view. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and put it on the selection. as a result, a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the top example, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is no keywords, which reduces the amount to three pictures. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and after that a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be switched off under Settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and realize that it should be one or be, you can easily change this by double clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which the database is searched. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set a Advanced search across all the elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the grouping button. the options then look as follows:</seg>

<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & digitise; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come with a predictable deflection from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the theme comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflows. additionally, you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed choices to make you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image editions are by email or web where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB is working so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should you use another color space and have to worry about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all the colors we can see, the horseshoe region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms's excellent site and click Info and then click Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to callipair my monitor if I chose to work only in sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in a sRGB colour space or not, you need to kallibrate your monitor, because sRGB means that your; onitor appears on sRGB. if you are working as a color space of sRGB, you either need to use your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, synchronize, Automatic comparison and contrast extend from the Edit Automatic correction menu attempt automatically from your colors to make the best. you'll need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the Leuststärling values over the entire image, leaving the darkest point black and the brightest point as bright as possible without changing its color shading. this function is often a magic correction for pictures that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Balance: this method adjusts the luminance factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. this means that almost every brightness area has the same number of pixels. sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in the image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic adjustment: this method maximizes color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light border shades and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Extend Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminous intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the highest possible range and a new jiushing of all values in between. this is only visible with well-balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance from & digiplug; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly restricted since there is a color space of 8-bit per color. if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can do the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyrighted Pawel T. Jochym. they launch it via the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen. the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, it is enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target format has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is indicated as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right up, a histogram is shown that changes dynamically as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful since, even in well lit pictures, most pixels have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadows adjustment can be improved or dimmed down the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. click on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result shown in the white balance. this will be displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly that. any setting of the white balance you set can save you into a text file and load them later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button will reset all filter values to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will make a different photo than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image here. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this encoding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be performed by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed description for using color profiles can be used to consult the Colour Management chapter.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu under Color Key Correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously so that you can use them for several photos at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and you will always need the same correction. in the manual for toning correction you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the gradation tool that you can find under color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digitised; mold color effects provide you with four color effects, a solar active effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canister filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation was also called Sabatier, an effect that was created by replacing a partially developed print with a short flash beam and then invert the development of the image. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photopaper from the additional light. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors through the second lighting were inverted. this tool allows you to fine tune this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar process. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. finally, a further increase produces a negative image that is not produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the Solarisation Effect. the original image is the (1) and processed the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">The name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for naturalistic photographers. Velvia's strongly saturated colors are also a few photographers, especially those who have little landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the Level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeat the strength of the neon light. for large images, the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photos. you can try to experiment the various color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the reverse problem: a too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple denial / contrast / gamma the tool is located for improving exposure. even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated, you only need the area of the slider for the purpose purpose described here. concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel, or the selected area. under the graph three sliders are clicked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate it is to shift the control and make sure that the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">The original and the preview of the image can be viewed on the right side. the preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it is possible to set whether the histogram is represented by a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera the linear representation is often dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knobs: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lower for the middle sounds, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pintes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, medium and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controller that can be used to interactively alter the output values as in the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a faded image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later. for this, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option Verification Indicator controls all color channels to locate overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only displayed in the preview and there is no effect to see at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photograph. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modify Channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images taken with a digital camera, the linear mode is usually the most meaningful. for images with large areas of constant color, the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you shift a curve section to the right, e.g. the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the corresponding image pixels become darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see. if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly that. any curve that you created can be stored in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When you create this method and the three color pipettes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadows, middle and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option over exposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels are found, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect to see at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The Edit & Did channel mixer; image editing is a tool for improving the color channels or changing the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="443">The channel selection box lets you select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left pane of the window will show you a preview. the original can be viewed in comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line in the histogram will appear to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are at the bottom right: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate luminance, the image will retain the general brightness even if you also use the option monochrome, because the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the farth. farbrauschen is composed of small smoke fake files that don't appear at the same spot in the color channel. if that's the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the colour first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for that purpose. any blender setup allows you to save and then load. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option Verification Indicator controls all color channels to locate overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only displayed in the preview and there is no effect to see at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the option Luminance is activated. the original image can be seen under (1) and the processed image under (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to reproduce. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, because color images can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film rolls.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky. thus similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">OrangeFilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. thus similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotary: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate lunar light scenes at daytime. thus similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepithora: produces warm light and medium tones as it adds a bit cold in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of the fate of a print and the re-development in a Sepithoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With & digiplug; applying tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, irrespective of whether it is a color image or not, you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall. the menu entry Image texture applying the image processing can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shifting this parameter to the right enhances the appearance of the depth and / or three-dimensionality of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and the modified under (2) to see. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the digiplug; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image. throughout the image with a colored line, niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-and-white pictures), strikantingly surrounds it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative insert an ornamental frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: is the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The finish decorated with the frame will be greater than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for the printing of the images, especially if you have used the tool According to the aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple a formatted text into a picture at any position. this is also possible in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its features as you need it. the larger the image, the larger the character must be. finally, select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." after the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With & digiplug; apply tool template you can put a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu Image Templates apply in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations concerning the size and orientation. however, you must take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) for the reduction of file size of the template. if you want to add your template the & digicode, simply send an email in English to the & digicode; mailinglist digiplug-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your stencil folder with the base folder in the dialog. select the folder where you copied the stencil files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder. the selection of a folder automatically updates the thumbnail of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview are three buttons with which you can change the zoom factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge This button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Reduce: this button shrinks the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image lying under the template. to do so, take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adapted automatically to the thumbnail size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiplug; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but generates, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurred mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. actually it sharpens not a bit, it works rather psychovisuell. you can use it to remove atmospheric vapour and it makes a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized images require a correction of the sharpness. this is because the digitization process can be combined with only minimal differences to one color point. this in turn results in sharp edges a bit blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">With JPEG pictures, a camera is often used for internal sharpness. images in raw format on the other hand must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a focus filter already during scanning the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo using the sharpening tool. you can use the menu entry to run the Correct Archipelago.</seg>
<seg id="487">But you should handle it carefully as the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also enhances the noise. generally, the most useful technique is refocussing the tool to sharpen an image. you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than to sharpen it. use the tool for softening with the menu entry Correct softeners and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Filter Unsharp Masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tested first. an increase in the radius or the amount increases the effect. if you make the blurred mask too strong, noise and the impression of burrs are created near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should best sharpen pictures in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image that is added to the original. thus the sharpness of the focus is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference-amount. this allows for a minimum difference to be defined for an edge of the filters. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharper and hence beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image that (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiplug; tool refocus refocuses a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted extraction Filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to change an image & quot; refocusserquot; in which it reverses the defocus. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurred mask. refocussing reaches usually better results than blurred.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular splitting works much better than the Gauß's fold. the Gauß's Faltung has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source-pixles that are far from the original source pixel. in most cases the FIR Wiener Inverse of Gauß's Faltung is affected even very strongly from the distant pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should result in 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very blurred then pay attention to Heiligencoupons.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality becomes very bad. a useful value is 0,03. a high value will even lower the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. use this parameter if your blurring is sharp. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular sharpness or the gauge's sharpness. however, note that the module is very slow if you select great values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for that purpose. any refocussing parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try out all trimming, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before otherwise change the image. the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">When you read and compress images, & eg; than JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, Unintentional masking produces better results than sharpens. this could be caused by the blurry masking a larger neighborhood than sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, blurred masking must always produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lineare filter. practically, the result of the FIR Vienna filter is always at least as good as the blurring mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocussed image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original blurred pattern must be corrected. this picture was made with an analogue camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods for the correction of sharpening in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English below this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The smoothness of the pad determines the blur of the area that has been darkened in order to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color ink allows a modified color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to fine tune the filter settings, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothness over the image. whereas larger values mainly smooth homogenous regions and leave details sharp. a value of 0.9 should keep details in such a way that no sharpening is necessary afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional Dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly across all directions while a value close to 1 is smoothed only in one direction. if you have a film particle or CCD sounds will produce a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothness above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it gets smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it has to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is passed. usually, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step width da [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is chosen small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated step width [0,1, 10]: integrated step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never exceed 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Using linear interpolation: the highest quality you get by selecting this option is minimal. it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to leave it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly that. any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is relatively quick at work. however, it may take a long time to load a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors are corrected with small artefacts. the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is an odd black artefact caused by a bad film bearing during the voyage. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected image under (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digitised; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable picture filters to remove stains and other artifacts such as dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings dialog can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius monitors the window size from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can blurb the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller errors adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch in front of the filter to detect luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter can no longer obtain image details and noise or lubricate occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controlled edge precision for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong it can't remove the whole noise or noise spikes can occur. set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas that are typically more strongly depleted.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of phase jitter. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filtering radius is reacted to variations of luminance. when it is raised, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. if it is at its minimum, noise and phase jitter can occur at the edges. it can remove noise spikes and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all the noise reduction parameters you set can be saved to the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use this tool for softening with the menu entry Correct softeners and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The digitization; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film grain, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or retroactively digitalized images. the smoothing takes place along the image contours and thereby preserves the content as it does the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture mapping. the texture mapping is performed with another tool, the image error correction. the algorithm for the restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labs in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm he produces some compressions & quot; Artefactor quot; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save As and Load buttons make exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is relatively quick at work. however, it may take a long time to load a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Stop.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with uniformity noise reduction.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera to an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces. the original image is under (1) and the corrected one (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures have been reduced to an old ink photograph taken with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by scanner lighting and photo paper. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected image under (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiplug; Hotpixel tool allows for hotpixel photos to be removed with a CCD camera gem, eight. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels "; and" quot; bright pixel quot; on a photo with a dark-picture subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Upload this file into the dark image wizard. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these will be highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you capture the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the fitting dark image to the image to be corrected. an auto-processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard remembers the last dark image and loads it automatically at the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview will help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. poor pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and see the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixels. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are moved to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic interface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image can be seen under (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The digitisation; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, in particular those in the medium and large photo format, often cannot illuminate the entire sensor range evenly. instead, "vignetting quot; (shading) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter time in such circumstances that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also use a center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise unsharpened effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of today's filament and colour and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image made without this filter. the tool Vignetting correction applies the transformation with a center filter to a picture. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controls, you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three more exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or accidentally a light intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Framing, Contrast, and Gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide you with positive values as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want finer readjustment of the exposure of the target image, let the values for luminous intensity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the Color Gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction applied to an image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a recess and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digitised; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometrical distortions. color distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second grade treats the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect, but flaunts at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth grade corrects the removed ends opposite to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value controls the thickness of the distortion second degree. negative values can be used to correct tone-shaped distortions and positive values of cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion part of the image. this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'Corner Parameters' has the opposite sign of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value renders the image size new and thus leads to a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighten: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview will illustrate the distortion correction. the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonn- and cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all trimming or size changes. best perform this correction as the first one. if you re-cut a picture and then perform a ton-shaped correction, the effect would be apparent.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal guide line. move the mouse cursor in the picture preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important location, such as the seashore or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the pitch / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black edges. you can remove them using the trimming tool in the Transform Edit menu from the image editing menu or via the Zoom control of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures, the sound-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motifs such as shots from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera by hand, you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of a ton-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image can be seen under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method of simulating infra-red film of the GimpGuru.org website which is accessible from this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfra film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters to set film baskets and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the Add Part Filmfired option if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows become white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce the infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs, as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the processed picture below (2) to see. the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top-lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The film grading is an easy-to-use tool for reproducing film grain on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed movies such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix large silver basins of the photographic emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grazing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, road-photographic, grainy image especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, set to ISO 2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grading effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that processed the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiplug; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. nature images and still lifes are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large pictures. smooth the smoothness or, viewed from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the processing is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel wide picture is 1 and Glätte 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digitized; Filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a cabbage sketch. the lines that define the outlines in the drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients are slowly changing are not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sketch you. this would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a range of values ranging from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controller selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon label filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digistar; Filter Grave shapes your picture in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug; Filter Grave is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, mondarling landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed picture (2). the depth used is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortions. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1, the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Stop.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Down: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center. this simulates the blurring of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurred the image by turning the pixels around a center point. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurring: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blurring: blurred the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving z: B: shot from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Characteristic blurring: blurred the image softly into the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Blurring: blurred the image by means of a random shift of pixels and simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the color basin in the picture and blurts it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Stop.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look. it uses a copyrighted algorithm created by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number varies the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can hold with the Edit & Edit; image editing a area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should stay free. if you start the filter from raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrop filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can put it in the right orientation by mirroring or rotating. you can find the tools in the menu Transforming Rotate or Transforming mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Inflating photo is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into an image when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you recover the missing information or guess? the Cimg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is to be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to change the size uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to increase a small image with a better quality then try the tool for blowing.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spine interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digicode; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo blobubbles was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in tab New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it gets smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it has to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly to this. each one can be saved as a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo blobubbles is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Stop.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo bloating by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard enlargement for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The editing of a photo is not only a frequently underestimated operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. to cut a photo you simply have to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle as you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again, the area of the photos will be cut off. this will give you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging at the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can be created by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The Ctrl button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl + + X). use the File Save or File Inventory entries under the File menu to save the newly edited photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview pane, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners using the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool According to the aspect ratio you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and in the cross-format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool According to the aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches, inches or any other physical size. you can for example see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontal or vertical.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog you can use the max. ratio knob to set the area to the maximum possible depending on the selected relation and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool According to the aspect ratio cuts its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the trimming tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF data, so that the EXIF data will reflect the cut picture and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the cohesion help make it possible to hide help so that you can better put your pictures together. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangles: harmonious partitions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third gel, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into a similar harmonious triangles at the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden mean is a split of different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting divider is equal to 1: 1.618 the golden mean. a composition which follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquefied guides when you put a picture together. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third gel, the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the viewer's eye along the spiral line and creates a symmetrical visual flow along this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should give something that the eye is located at the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are also derived from the gold spiral discussed above. their vertices are the central points on the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect called Dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirrors and vertical mirroring options can be used to reflect the harmonious partitions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the Color button you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it's easy to keep the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can repair it with the Edit & Edit, image editing and the tool free rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slide again to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help the module Free Rotation provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the picture preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a print on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture, you will find undesired triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair this is to use the function Transforming Cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the Automatically Cutting function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after rotation. note however the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are carried out around a fixed point to the so-called point of reference. this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recalculated. on the right of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Corner at the top: displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle Right below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the picture is slightly smeared. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments produce a double effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adjusted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the image with transformer trimming from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shoring tool is used to move part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. for example, horizontal shearing will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. this is not a rotation, the image is distorted into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Turn your picture by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line is displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the shading tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the picture is blurred a bit. for a single shearing this effect is usually negligible, but two shments producing twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After shearing, the image has unattractive triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transformations from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digicode; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digitized.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependency on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all the file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF underneath.</seg>

<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select even the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found on Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally there are better, smoother results than JPEG on the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also store lossless if specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to know more about the raw image format, you can read very helpful instructions in English under Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour. you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from & digiplug; see the Configuration section for more information on how to use modules with & digimaster;.</seg>

<seg id="726">The & kgraphviewer; Project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphviewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphviewer; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; at. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration into & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change of the graph in & kate; the graph recounts and in & kgrapher;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphs in & kate; to open or to open the graphs in & kgrapher; in a & kate; component</seg>

<seg id="731">Further required software: & kgraphviewer; is a & kde; program that presupposes the & graphviz; -tool & dot; for the representation of graphs.</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in a separate subwindow. initially, when you start & kgraphviewer; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the icon file and the (empty) list contains last opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the bottom screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt keys);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming is limited in both directions by the factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>

<seg id="738">You can choose whether to reload the graph or if you want to ignore the change. & kgraphviewer; can also remember your decision, so you can change your decision later. if you want to change your decision later, you can set the menu item Settings cgrapher; set up... see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graph file outside of a running & kgraphviewer; instance, & eg; in the file browser or command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & kgraphviewer; instance, or want to display the graph to be loaded in a subwindow of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but can also change it using the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">At the start of the program, you can open all graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how to split the graph to several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you are using multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page will be adjusted to this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled in by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>

<seg id="749">Here you can choose between different & graphviz and layout algorithms. the entries, as described on the website of & graphviz, are:</seg>
<seg id="750">The algorithm sets the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for indexed graphene. it produces accounts according to the bounce spring model. it uses the Kamada-Kawai algorithm, which is equivalent to statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm generates a spring-spring model for unexecuted graphene. it uses the Fruitman pure gold heuristics, and includes a multi-latch for the treatment of large and clustered graphene.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the nodes circle-shaped according to the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for specific diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is then executed by a shell. the command should accept the graph file as a parameter, and print the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can specify & eg; the & graphviz; algorithms change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Specifies the type of graph (directed or executed) and applies the default algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directed, & neato; for executed graphs).</seg>

<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. at the moment, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan pictures: use the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the sane project or another source such as video streams. for this to work you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu item, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select here the source from which you want to get the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears in that you can replace the default ducrhe own to select your image accordingly. see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image with the button. the estimated file size will be shown in the right, lower corner.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is displayed completely, as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the Scan button you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window for setting the target image appears. here, you can specify the compression and the type of image file. please remember that the BMP type is not compressed and therefore very large files created. you also need to select the folder & # 160; or create it by saving the image.</seg>

Flickr makes it possible to send his photos to people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, place the photos of your camera phone online and show your photos securely and privately to your friends and family around the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Export to Flickr module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you will be guided through the process of creating a token. it is used for your authentication so it is virtually your identification to Flickr. a browser is started to allow you to login with Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration, the module can send photos to Flickr web page. you will be presented the following page after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after you have pressed Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exports to Flickr for the second time, you are greeted with the following dialog, which displays the current access permissions that indicates the module. for upload, you need write permissions. the module does not currently support other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button Add Photos should be pressed once you have set all other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. when you press the Ok button, you start uploading the photos to Flickr server.</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI geographic localization module provides tools to locate pictures geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data, you need a GPS track as XML file in the gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical Localization Correlation. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and go to the menu. the above looking dialog appears then. to load a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. this file of course contains data recorded at the same locations as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed that indicates the coordinates in red. GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera connection must be recalculated with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS-time and the camera level. if the deviation from it is merged, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have track data from one location for images, you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching data. if you know that in reality there is a location in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same location. since the dialog boxes the coordinates from one call to the next you just have to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. to do so, select the region in question and increase sie.Perform this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the card can be changed manually between card mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a pile of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Module Photo Gallery is a tool for exporting a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to allow for the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab selection allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML. the albums are not shown hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the Albensee and the text will appear in the header of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self explanatory. the option For each picture one page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page. if you then click on a picture, a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; KuickShow</seg>
<seg id="825">The Rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIXHTML, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG image format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With Other color depth, you can change the default color depth, which naturally also affects the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider thumbnail allows you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during creation. the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool for viewing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and to perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons. it has been developed for a fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size is rising, because no compression of the color information takes place. this can be found e.g. also with PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI Module Digital Camera Client is a tool for connecting your computer with a digital camera.</seg>

<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the Mjpegl and ImageMagick packages. you can add a basic image transfer between the individual images. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slideshow. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Diaschau. after that, you can create the module via Tools MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected are then listed in the portfolio under image files. there you can also change sorting of the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your schedule, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high, very smooth picture change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should leave it black. you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the mpeg output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have all adjusted your preferences, you can start generating the movie with the button coding. depending on the speed of your computer you can now go to enjoy a coffee quickly or in all rest and enjoy the slide show if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indication appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the jpegs and ImageMagick packages using the button Settings right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The Print Wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing gip. this is e.g. useful to improve or print with the Gimp module for direct printout.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: do not expect dcraw to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file to convert and start the module. the Raw image converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the Preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings for the white balance should be used. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected for you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">As soon as you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The tagged image format, TIFF, keeps all information in your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you intend to process your images often or otherwise use them later, you should not select the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG File in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are safe, e.g. by testing in a single image, which is the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing files. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or enlarge the image. to do this, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportionally (1 dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportionally (2 dim.): resizing in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. for example, you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not Proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Press preparation: prepare the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, border size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred email program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will be shown with the images you selected. click the Add Images button to add more images with a file selection dialog. for the last selected image a preview will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the image list to add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button to remove images, the selected images are removed from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images you can use the OK button to open the new message window of your e-mail client. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. the images you have selected are already attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Most e-mail accounts have limitations on the size of e-mails sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The email window will be used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration will be saved and used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you will need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you are using the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments will be added to the images in a text file and added to the email.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to the lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in JPEG image format and the original files in JPEG format, then the original copy data will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages, in search of errors. however, your email program will automatically start at the end. by closing the button you can close this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the Advanced Slideshow window, a window will appear with questions about how you want to display your slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-transitions option in the presentation will use very elegant image transitions with OpenGL. however, you have to have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The Show File name option ensures that the filename of the images is displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop. you can then reset it manually with Esc; Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option to select images randomly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used in the order of the images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The time distance between the images can be set between the pictures. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should test it before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select. randomly, each transition between the images selects a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can pause and start the presentation, jump to the previous and next image and stop the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">As soon as you have your pictures and videos with annotations, you can browse with & kphotoalbum; Browse through them, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, are now available in each group, thus in persons, places and in the group keyword (s).</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have entered your images and videos with notes. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and, of course, view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">When you select another person you will only see the images on which both persons are to be seen. by using this method you can restrict the number of displayed images from a few thousand images to a few images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, places and other settings, you can view images of your area with thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of their name. you can save with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own thumbnail, that is of course also valid for places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To display images next to the names, select the button located on the right of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu you can select which view you want to use for each category. this has the advantage that you can display e.g. icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must select which image to display for each individual person. to do this, you need to open the image view window (described in more detail) and select the image for the respective person in the context menu. here you can customize the image for the respective person. in the View window, you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and choose which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you access the Find dialog in the main window, you will see a dialog which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can preview this dialog once again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the labeling or description field, the captions and descriptions of the images will be searched for this text. if you would like, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can be either a part of the total file, e.g. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all images by specific names as you can see in the picture. here we see images on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum; if you don't like to read manuals, but rather want to try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo if you start & kphotoalbum; start the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; demo. after that, some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print out this manual, you can find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar you can see here:. as the name suggests, this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays a different unit. you can switch between units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed items Preview View from the database (when you select a date, you will see the first image of this date in the preview pane) and also the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview window.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by holding down the mouse button and dragging the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select a range, you will only preview images of this time in the preview window. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you with two ways to create HTML websites with your images. the one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other is available as module (see). the following part of the user manual is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version, which you can create through the menu file HTML....</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages are created, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and target. in the following, each area is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the overview and a description that the HTML file should contain later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select whether a & kphotoalbum; export file should be created that is visible on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed, which are obvious to the viewer as well. for example, that all images are from a party. note that & kphotoalbum; currently all images are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why not specifically addressed to them.</seg>
<seg id="923">On the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images. this means those who watch your website and have a monitor supporting the maximum resolution 800x600 will not download any more images that have a resolution of 1600x1200 for example.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have set. so it can browse your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transfer time. if he wants to get an image larger, he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best choose a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder where all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and added automatically next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if they are really all visible to the viewer. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created will be started. the URL you set here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files you created are not yet in the final destination folder, you have to manually copy them there. to ensure the import function, see, correctly you have to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder where all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">All three settings are related to the base folders and URLs. this creates a subfolder whose name will be set to the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or anywhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; come together, you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have spent a lot of time applying the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work will not do again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a shortcut to pictures. the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the pictures together and that file can be passed so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the File Export menu... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding pictures are not found, then the images of the URL you have created when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following describes the dialog for exporting images that you can access through the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. there are three choices available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the option to copy manually to the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically Copy to the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are regular zip files. since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you still want this, simply select the Export File option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size, because the .kim file would otherwise be very big. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File File menu... select, & kphotoalbum; import the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then, in which folder to import images to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category people of the file to import (if you are a domain) while this category is named in your database. therefore, in the third dialog you will be asked which categories of the file to import are to be imported and which categories they correspond to in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can synchronize the categories of the file to import with the categories of your current database. an example for this can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups. if you look for example pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is shown.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the various steps from (1) to set the information about your images, (2) searching and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program to manage your images. however, it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos. at many places in this manual it is talked about pictures, but frequently it also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the topmost folder of its images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; remembers the folder where your images are stored and uses it automatically at future starts. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum; so you can start a different folder tree with pictures, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the option -c. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry settings kphotoalbum; set up... go to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual the various settings are explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different icons, with which you can access settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting a detailed help is available, which you can access by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each picture, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups, such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">Click on the dialog which is used to edit already existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the Options section, subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog, you can set up all member groups, i.e. all members of a group at one time in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the left-hand side of the window you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window you will find a list of the current category and the list of sub-categories in the right.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; divides its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this modular system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the menu module. the modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are shared by several applications together, it may be that the modules with & kphotoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using these on your own pictures. demo database can be run either via the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use via KIPI are very different, so it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; not working. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications can arrange their images in albums: an album is simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates the order by albums for some modules, so you can use the features with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view, so all images that show you the picture preview right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the current album, & kphotoalbum; the modules also have a list of albums. here goes & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the content of a category, for example all persons, then each entry in this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category people, & kphotoalbum will do so, so if you have selected people to view it and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the setup dialog and select the modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top. under the toolbar you will see the window with which you have not entered your image database. currently, there are not very many information, since you do not yet have any information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see any picture with annotations. this includes information about the persons depicted in the image, etc. you can set each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time. if, for example, is shown on all pictures Jesper and all images recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view, you will see three lists with a text box where you can define people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons, you can, because the names used are moved up, find and classify the persons faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the sorting symbol by date on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected annotations for each image individually, you may want to edit all selected images and add these images with notes. in this case simply click on the thumbnails and back buttons that are located at the top right of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded several images, e.g. with the same person, it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Several entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States. San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">The image shows a browser window that shows the USA as an overlay. to show you that it is an overlay, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the Comment dialog is it possible to add an entry to an existing or new revision or subcategory. additionally, you can simply drag an entry to a category and place it there in order to sort it into a subcategory of this item. attention, this assumes you just sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that form the top edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by moving it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options button, which gives you the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then select / hide windows. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the images in the browser you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all images if you have not set filters. an example for this can be seen here. you can configure the size of thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will be displayed in the picture viewer. if you don't have a window with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the preview screen. simply select the respective images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Delete the Edit menu from the Edit menu. now the window that you can see in the picture will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphotoalbum; namely, images can also be used without you stored on your hard drive. of course you need to have the pictures stored somewhere, so & kphotoalbum; you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is truncated are not stored on the hard drive. for example, the thumbnails are available for the pictures 5-9, so that & kphotoalbum; you can preview these images, however, you can't view these images with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back to. & kphotoalbum; do not support it until now. if you want to avoid hassle of how to mess up your pictures, please buy a larger hard drive to save all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, you filter the images so that at the end those who want to make you unapproachable and click Actual View in the menu Privacy. alternatively, you can also select all pictures that your little sister may see, navigate and lock the menu item Anything out of the current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you have defined which images should be hidden in the case of the case. if you give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry pictures, so that all images you have locked will be hidden. if you want to get the pictures displayed again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe. on the one hand, all images on the hard drive and on the other can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection only serves to repel those who are familiar with & kphotoalbum; not very familiar.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you manage all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and describe hours for hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason, & kphotoalbum; with a picture _ and video viewer. this you can start from preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. of course he shows the picture, but additional all the information you have to enter via the picture, such as who is in the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the infobox on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and discard somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information can be displayed at all. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the infobox are underlined. if you click here, the browser will display suitable entries to this. so if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by jumping the buttons on the image high and down. you can jump to the first and last image with pos1 and end. these functions are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it can load a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; it is possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the entire space on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can enter the image in and out. to zoom in, you can simply pull a rectangle with the mouse. the plus button zooms in the middle of the image with the minus key. shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the dot button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not shown zoomed. with the Sync button sets the zoom, so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">You can rotate the image using the turn functions from the context menu. this does not work for videos. you can make comments to the current image using the menu item Comment from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you look at images it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture. at the moment you can view it and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. you will probably prefer to select only the image and see more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the images developed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to add pictures with features while viewing them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letter. in the picture you will see a picture in which the characters A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have identified features on your images, they are available to you in the browser. so, if you want to print, print or whatever images you have selected, simply add them all at once with annotations. this is described in. after that, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be viewed in the preview view. if you can display categories in the Indre view view, you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the letter for the attribute after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you can get your photo album; painting on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not stored with the image, but in the database. in the way you can reverse your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to turn off the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; turn on the image from the context menu. to end the painting press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; work, you must have the application of the program & Povray; not fully proficient, but documentation to & Povray; be sure to read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views are shown in yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the object of an object that is already selected, as all subprojects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">In order to insert a new object into the object tree, select the location where you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu appears to allow you to choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Delete selected objects from the scene using either the Edit menu or the right mouse button context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to take these changes. if you entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with a fault description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or reject the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Click thumbnail in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the chosen texture. as default the entire texture will be rendered even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), check out locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen shot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the parent object or as absolute value. objects are only displayed when selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window ordering as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it at will. you can also save several window arrangements and easily switch between different orders.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a present view, drag the beginning stream to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view. the new view then is anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views of one another, drag the beginner in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the tabs at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to remove a view from the anchoring, drag the protector on the desktop or click the small arrow pointing upwards in the front bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the front bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views into the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can fix them in any position.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with view window arrangement... it displays a dialog where you can save the window ordering under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. when this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 current. this version is in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 does not support.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the Rendering icon on the Rendering icon in the toolbar or select the menu item View vignette.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar, or select Render modes in the View menu... the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but meaningful is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the box size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you only want to render a small area of the image, select the check box subsection and enter the image section to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the Combination field Quality you can select the properties that & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection light. a detailed description of render properties can be found in the user manual of & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">When a picture is rendered with just one ray per pixel several errors can arise. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are less than a pixel in the representation. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this feature look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects Povray; more than a ray per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. the second method is adaptive, non-recursive; the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is repeatedly splitted and adapted because recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels will be calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a lattice of 4 x 5 (25) will compute additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually followed and tested for further subdivisions. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. if you enable ittering, changed & Povray; the rays are a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection is calculated. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">This tab allows you to specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding beams have not hit any object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for viewing the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly finished, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; select the Import File menu item... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supported & kpovmodeler; not yet the full scope of & Povray; if error messages or warnings occur when importing, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source text between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object to the open text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste into & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can add source for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene is rendered. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click help in the property view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. set the path to your document and the version. supported are the versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object of the points to the grid in the contextual menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the sphere, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high detailed fidelity for extended projections, all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an advanced projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approximation to the projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is displayed in a chessboard pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick the floor, a bottom is rendered under the objects. the floor is represented in a chessboard pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used to render the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value. more precise information about the parameters can be found in the Render modes section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can modify existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements. in the section window orders, explains how to create and save window arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The default window arrangement: displays all existing window arrangements. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The Existing window orders list shows all existing window arrangements. a new arrangement allows you to create with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name displays all views for the selected window arrangement. new views can be created with the Add button and Delete selected views with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column you create a new column on the right of the existing window, with Unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with card card you will receive a map card view together with the previous view and floating anchored the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without any more precise knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen. if you are using a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied to render, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything without errors, you can see the first start of window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing icons of the toolbar. read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You'll often have to use these menus and symbols, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, first you need to remove all objects from the object tree. mark the scene and then select the menu item Edit Delete. with this you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create. in particular, you will notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray; see further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything at the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera has control points in the view that you can change the target point of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the Apply button or the Enter key, the wire model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the perspective of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you might, for example, insert a cadre (insert the final mind bobbin) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method of solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler way. you can use an infinite layer as a floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also displays the level, albeit at the moment only as a limited finite layer. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree, you will find that you can unfold the entry for the ground if you click on the + in front of the object. in this case, you will see only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shifting. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to the drill a unit under the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. select shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog opens in which you can select how the object is to be inserted. the pigment is then displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (Name = bottom pigment), with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment only shows a matt black material because you have to re-enter settings for the pigment. now always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the header and the ball in the preview, click on the Apply button and then click on the preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you expected. in the color list you have to enter two new attributes called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Each time, select one color in the object tree and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to execute this step, since you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be created just as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget to press the input key or the button Apply), so the ball will float above the floor as you have moved the floor down one unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering now gives a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the following step, set a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as with the floor, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First subproperty and change the name for example in Sphere Pigment. click on ball Pigment, then select one color and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finishing properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the screenshots below and click Apply or press the Enter key.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection already give partly good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome-plated surfaces even if Metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what options are offered to you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracysourcing is a render method to create a two dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you are raytracing a scene, the renderer shooting hypothetical beams from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this ray is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog have an effect.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you see the scene. without a light source you also don't see anything, the picture is simply black. obviously every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file that you created previously with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the recently reversed command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing undo.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new order or overwrite an existing layout.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the appearance, shortcuts and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change key shortcuts. you can use this option to change default short commands for & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can use this option to add and remove tool icons for & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1125">A pump-map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic objects are simple geometric shapes that can be used as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this base body. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by using an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickShow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickShow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that can be displayed by clicking on the & LMBs; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, simply type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the right lower corner. if a matching file name has been found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the dialog box & ball show; there are five flashcards. in three of them, General and editing and slide show, you can set the way of working & kuickShow; in the other two, short instructions for the display window and short commands for the browser, the shortcuts for each window can be specified.</seg>

<seg id="1182">You may set up any existing multimedia buttons in such a way that they work as & Amarok; shorts will make your keyboard to & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions that are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browsers, players, playlists, playlists browsers and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports Qt and & kde command line options; in addition, Amarok also has some command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script to see if all required modules are present and use kdialog so that the user knows why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin with require 'Corundum' Rescue LoadError 0 = 'Korundum' (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script. '' kdialog --sorry '# {error}' 'exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and steer Amarok. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; which should be included in every KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow executing external programs and commands. this usually uses the function exec (). in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this purpose strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure The script to show the setup dialog. to store and store the setup data, each script needs to take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok will set the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signals that a new piece is being played. the script could now & zb; use DCOP functions to query further information about the new piece (for example, the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume Signalizes a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customization: Submenu itemTitle Device Sets the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a user-defined menu entry is clicked. submenu and itemTitle can be used to add the DCOP function dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (Submenu itemTitle). to remove an entry you can use dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (Submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user terminates a script, sends & Amarok; the SIGTERM signal to the script. this signal should be processed to do e. g. saving data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user and zb have downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend an archive name, such as meinskript.cat.tar.bz2, so that the user can clearly see the archive as the Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the erasing catamaran script. for this reason, you should name your script packages right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the other modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to preserve the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can recharge it to www.kde-apps.org and append the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok; for your entry on kde apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist, rather than having to work through endless menus. you may also search for a very specific title for thousands of items in your collection. with & Amarok; 's collection browser and quick search, you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>

<seg id="1224">Setting up the on-screen display allows you to switch on the OSD. if on-screen display is labeled, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shadow causes the text to be shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Use your own colors to customize the OSD colors for font and background. clicking on the colour surfaces opens the dialog for selecting colors. if your own colors are not activated, the default colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The display text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering wildcards, the OSD can be adapted to your needs. below is a list of available space holders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinerama users, so you can specify which screen to display the OSD in a multi-monitor environment.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down selector. some drivers still activate more settings in this card card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The collection card collection is used to set up all the settings for your collection. this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder that & Amarok; to search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also includes check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Recursively browse subfolders: this means that & Amarok; both the selected and their subfolders will search for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: allows & Amarok to monitor the selected folders to changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). besides, an incremental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and no further KDE packages. so you have to have kdelibs installed (including the included programs, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to compile kdelibs minimally.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features such as the OSD require that your window manager will keep the relevant standards from freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, for example, but fluxbox will help for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Taglib library. you can locate the file by looking in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developer at bugs.kde.org and also append the broken file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and let the collection be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time, this is due to the fact that taglib falls from this file when reading the meta-information. please report these errors to the Taglib developer at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. the support for it in & Amarok; is somewhat matured.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all libraries from & Amarok were compiled with the same compiler version. if e.g. & Amarok, compiled with GCC 3.4, Taglib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes while editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable autom. switch off when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use at least one value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the email will automatically open for a crash). if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta-Infos, but do not mark it as Unicode. the following perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the file $ARGV (0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: Mplib- &gt; new ($ARGV [0]); my $v2tag = $mp3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1254">& Amarok; s symbols in the Status bar (Random Mode / Repetition / Dynamic Playlist) are always active in KDE 3.4.0. this is a known bug in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes the icon effects will be removed. note that in some cases, one has to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows their effect.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: symbol lookup error: amarokapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KsystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap, please check if Amarok uses the correct qt library. this can be seen with ldd 'which amarokapp' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok will find the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Most of the installation problems are easiest due to the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help from other users or developers. use the forum and the IRC under irc.freenode.net in the # Amarok channel.</seg>

<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you in the search for the cause of the problem and a solution. for GStreamer, you may need to provide a different sink (e.g. osssink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">That does & Amarok; already. don't forget that media must first be decoded. you can not simply send an MP3 to ALSA, you would just want a white noise. GStreamer reads the file, decodes them and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>

<seg id="1285">& Amarok; is an album by the British Mike Oldfield. I like it very much and find that the name sounds good. in addition, the name contains the magic K...:)</seg>
<seg id="1286">Thanks to DCOP this is already possible. set an alarm in your calendar program and run this command with the alarm command: dcop Amarok player play</seg>
<seg id="1287">This command lets & Amarok; start playing. make sure that & Amarok; runs before going to bed, then you are awakened by the soft sounds of music that you have stopped before going to bed.</seg>
<seg id="1288">How to find the current in & Amarok; running titles if you are on another computer?</seg>
<seg id="1289">If there is a working SSH environment, you can proceed as follows. this command will give you the interpreter and title of the running piece: SSH -i ~ / .ssh / id _ rsa ihreIP dcop --user ihreusable Amarok player nowPlaying</seg>
<seg id="1290">Replace the IP address with your IP and your user name with your user name. this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .ssh / id _ rsa file.</seg>
<seg id="1291">The visualizations can be separated from the & Amarok; window. press d on the keyboard and the current analyzer opens in an independent window in the size.</seg>
<seg id="1292">The combination of Ctrl + right mouse button puts a piece in the click sequence into the queue. pressing the Enter key after searching in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search.</seg>
<seg id="1293">OK, the player window and the playlist have tricky features, but how does the icon in the system section of the control bar look like?</seg>
<seg id="1294">Click on the title of a browser. in the context menu you can select which browsers you want to display.</seg>
<seg id="1295">My Personal Folder $HOME is located on an NFS drive. after the start of Amarok, the collection database cannot be created and there are many error messages appearing on the console. what now?</seg>
<seg id="1296">The internal SQLite database from & Amarok; does not work with NFS. either you have to link ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok to a local drive, or use Amaroks MySQL support.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Insert the CD, then click Play Audio CD in the menu. it opens a file browser with multiple folders. for normal reading change into the wav folder, select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Konqueror window. for automatic encoding, you will instead take files from the folders mp3 or ogg.</seg>
<seg id="1298">QStringList values = query (QString ("SELECT playcounter, createdate, and" FROM statistics "" WHERE url = '% 1'; ") .arg (escapeString (url)));</seg>
<seg id="1299">Basically this adjusts the previous rating with a decreasing value based on how often the piece was played. the more often the piece was played, the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You can add the rating for a piece by clicking on a column heading in the playlist window. then you can change the rating of a piece just like all other attributes, namely by clicking the right mouse button on the piece and editing: select or Edit F2. you can also edit the rating in the Metadata dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1301">The developers don't want you to tell you when you want to release a stable version of Amarok. this means: KDE packages have a specified release schedule that is not compatible with the short-term set of Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1302">This is a new feature in Amarok, which some users can also find annoying. deactivate the option icon when playing animated in the general settings.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The Analyzer is part of the toolbar. select Settings Toolbars... and select the changes you want.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Download a design, or create your own. then install it under Amarok... Appearance context browser design, click on New Design Install....</seg>
<seg id="1305">The icon was similar to the logo of Warp Graphics Inc. (elfquest.com). to avoid any difficulties it was removed.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Konqueror's navigation range allows you to monitor and monitor & Amarok; while browsing in Konqueror. start konqueror and press F9 to view the navigation pane. then click the button Settings (top) and select the Amarok pop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Audio crobbler is a free service to be sent to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server. the service is free of charge and you only need a free username and a password. audio crobbler will be fully supported by & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1308">If you want to use ALSA, please use the latest available version. old ALSA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore also caused a lot of bug reports.</seg>
<seg id="1309">Probably, & Amarok; compiled before you installed xine or GStreamer. therefore, the. / configure routine does not compile these output modules. you need to reconfigure and install Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1310">Now I & Amarok; newly installed, but the output modules still don't appear. and now?</seg>
<seg id="1311">You probably need to install a distribution that will install the development files separately from the actual program. although GStreamer is installed, you will need to install the GStreamer-devel package. the same also applies to xine, you need to install xine-devel. after that, you will need to recompile and install Linux.</seg>
<seg id="1312">I get the error GStreamer CRITICAL * *: factory for 'Adder' has no type.. How can I fix this?</seg>
<seg id="1313">Your version of GStreamer has been compiled with Prelshrinking, which is incompatible with GStreamer. you need to compile GStreamer without Prelinking. a tip from merlin-tc: don't use LDFLAGS if you compile Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1314">I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file's mimetype audia / mp4 although the module GStreamer faad is installed.</seg>
<seg id="1315">In addition to GStreamer-faad, GStreamer-quicktime module has to be installed in order to play mp4 or m4a files with GStreamer.</seg>

<seg id="1318">I have a second sound card and use ALSA. how to use the second sound card with Amarok?</seg>
<seg id="1319">Set up the Amarok settings... add the audio output to the device. typical is, for example, hw: 0 for the standard sound card and hw: 1 for the second.</seg>
<seg id="1320">Here is an example for ~ / .asoundrc on a machine with onboard AC97 codec and a USB audio device:</seg>

<seg id="1322">Enter usb-audio in the setup dialog of xine and the output takes place on the USB sound card. so-lib takes care of the conversion of the sample rate, channels and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1323">If you want to use a virtual dmix device, disable the tick on sound card support mmap.</seg>
<seg id="1324">Sorry, but the audio output with Arts is not supported any further. you may, of course, like to take this problem yourself into your hand! if you want, you can become the new so much needed supervisor for Arts:)</seg>
<seg id="1325">Listen to music should be quite simple! for this reason, there is the setup wizard that will be displayed at the first start of & Amarok. if you want to update your collection later, or simply don't like the wizard, then this Quick Start Guide will help you. with their help you will have installed & Amarok; in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1326">Creating a playlist is very simple. drag entries from the collection browser to the playlist. the small text field for filtering the collection facilitates you searching for certain pieces. if you are happy with the playlist, you can save it by saving playlists at the click of a button. you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1327">If you have your own playlists, you can add them to the playlist browser. if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection, and you have enabled the option to import playlists, then these playlists are already in the tree view. with a right click on a playlist, you will get different ways to load the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To play an audio CD, please select Actions Audio CD in the menu bar. it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD pieces in WAV format. drag the wav files into the playlist and then press the play button.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The audio CD function uses the protocol audiocd: / and is not compatible with all available drivers.</seg>
<seg id="1330">The burning feature is also available in the playlist. simply click with the right mouse button on an entry and follow the burning menu. you have here various possibilities for burning a CD.</seg>
<seg id="1331">& Amarok; requires installation of some software packages. the required packages are listed below. in addition, some additional packages are listed that make work with & Amarok; more enjoyable.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages through a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you also need to install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player, also & Amarok; a player window with the most important functions. additionally, & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to all others.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window there is a scroll bar displaying the currently running piece or the current stream. directly below is the area, the game time, bit rate and samplerate of the current piece. a click on this area changes the display of the currently expired play time for the remaining play time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">The Player window also includes a selection of audio analyzers, even under the balance display. you can switch by the available Analyzer by clicking the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer will be displayed in an independent, magnifiable window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons also feature the PL and EQ buttons. the PL button activates or deactivates the Playlist window while the EQ button is used to set up Equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of playback buttons, the volume control and the play position slider. use the sliders to adjust the play position or volume. playback buttons allow you to start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own preferences.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer use Tools Equalizer from the Main Menu or click the EQ button in the Player window. once you mark the Equalizer check box, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The & Amarok playlist; is the most widely developed playlist of all available multimedia players. it has many features that don't exist in any other player. but don't be deterred by the abundance of features, they're all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be split into two main areas, on the left is the navigation. in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser. on the right there is the playlist itself.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays various information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and interpreter. these three subwindows will later be explained in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have previously used earlier versions of & Amarok, you may notice that the subwindow has dropped off. the information displayed there has now been distributed in other parts of & Amarok. additionally, the information can be viewed in the Statistics window (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz icon. click on this icon to emulate the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Under the MusicBrainz icon you will find more information about the current piece. you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended Parts, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on any of these pieces, it will be played instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this interpreter. this section displays the top five highest rated pieces of the current performer.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information to display in the music subwindow. to do so, right click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be opened and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all tracks in the individual fields to start playback right away. you can also right-click on it and then select one of the options for adding the play or album to the playlist right from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the subwindow text the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece. this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using the scripts themselves. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, & Amarok will try to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is yet running, you can choose which one to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button enables you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Find button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Artist - only groups the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres will be disregarded.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Artist / Album - First the pieces will be sorted by interpreter and among them will be another distribution according to the respective album. if you want to see compilations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under various performers.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Artist / Year - Album - Sort by interpreter and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest ones first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is used.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically among each other. the artist will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / artist - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album under the artist.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons you can customize and combine grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically reappend your collection as soon as you change something on the selected folders. if you own a lot of pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located directly under the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. instructions for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter you find a selection box, with which you can filter the last added pieces to your collection. you can choose different time windows, starting from the last 24 hours up to one year. furthermore, you can also select your complete collection, which will enable the filter to be switched off practically.</seg>
<seg id="1368">Clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser will give you the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This will insert the current playlist and insert the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Append to Playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on one entry you will get the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue. this will make you play next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you are asked for a name under which the list is to be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer the pieces to the media player to the media player. for more details, see the Media Player browser section for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / Burn to CD - This means that the selected pieces will be sent to K3b and burned either as a data or an audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option will not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit Metadata (for n pieces)... - Opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) Move files to the garbage bin... - open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm it, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears in various performers.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Pick up a compilation - change a record marked as a compilation album back into a normal album. after that the album will no longer be shown under various performers, but again under the corresponding interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser is easy to handle with lots of playlists, including smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. they use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are also possible. click Add smart playlist to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist, where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The subwindow Media Player is used for connecting & Amarok; using your portable media player (eg iPod). in order to use your iPod with & Amarok, for example, it must be mounted in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod by interpreter in the top list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired tracks from the playlist and drop them onto the list Artist. if you're done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. if the transmission is complete, exit & Amarok; and release the drive connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar you find a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar where you can fetch music from a given URL. for example, if you type tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz and press Enter key, you can access music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the appending of files can be difficult by simply dropping the Shift key. in this case, the holding down of the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired location and dropping. over the playlist is a text field in which you can enter a filter. once you enter letters, just press the pieces that contain the letters. to reset the filter, press the reset button until the text box is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">When you enter delimited search terms, & Amarok will search for entries containing all search terms. for example, if you enter one in two, the search will find all the entries containing one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">When you enter the OR, search for entries containing either one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example will find all the pieces containing one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, please enclose the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that Mike Oldfield contain, but not according to entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a certain search column, you can also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a certain search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something is looking for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this is looking for all the pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield OR a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the order sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then clicking with the right mouse button in the desired sequence on the entries. the entries will then be marked with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left, you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow undo and restore. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar there is a unique, extendable Analyzer. the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as that which you get in the player window via the right mouse button. over this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more buttons available for the toolbar, for example, playback control and volume control. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on menu and selecting toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist. it displays the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total play time of all the pieces. in addition, the status for random mode and retrieval, a slider for the playback position and the playing time of the current piece is displayed. the status for random mode and retrieval can be easily changed by double clicking the corresponding display area with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do this, disable the status bar option in the general settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the menu in the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1404">Click on this entry to open the Visualization plug-in window. there you can select the visualizations of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry you can find a sub-menu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images. you can launch it by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection. you can view all albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1408">From the View menu you can choose what to display in the cover administration. choose from:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue management received your big move into & Amarok; 1.3. with this feature you have even more control over the playlist. after you have set a piece in the queue, the playlist will appear a number next to the title. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the plays will play: 1 will play first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">When you want to add a piece to the queue, select the piece in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, two of which are pre-specified (the details for setting up these later).</seg>
<seg id="1412">Fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds other random pieces while playing.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Adds pieces based on load .fm recommendations (formerly: audioscrobbler). this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist. you do not need a Last.fm profile for this dynamic playlist to work.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Double click on the playlist you want, drag it to the playlist window or right-click on it and then select Load. this way, your current playlist is replaced by the new. so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances!</seg>
<seg id="1415">The two pre-set modes of Random Mix and Playlist Mix immediately fill your playlist and you can add playback directly. the Playlist Recommended pieces will be added to your collection at least once. the recommended pieces will be added at the next piece change, so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1416">If you want to keep the current playlist, enable the last possible dynamic mode: settings Dynamic mode. this will use your existing playlist as the starting point. the dynamic mode can also be disabled via the same menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="1417">The New button fills the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode. edit the playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Right-click on a dynamic playlist, you have the option to click Edit. as a result, the dialog opens to edit the settings of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Enter any name for the playlist here, but the name should be unique to avoid confusion.</seg>
<seg id="1420">If this setting is not active, your playlist will continuously grow, the setting for upcoming pieces will be skipped and they will not listen to duplicates in this playlist. if the setting is active, the played pieces will be removed while respecting the settings.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist. this allows you to easily see which pieces were recently played.</seg>
<seg id="1422">This is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each played piece. if you set more than 1, the playlist will continuously grow, because only one piece can be played and removed.</seg>
<seg id="1423">The settings on the right are already described in the previous section. on the left of the dialog you can select already existing playlists or smart playlists. if you cross multiple playlists, & Amarok will add random plays from each of the playlists you have clicked.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Some scripts allow your own settings. you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on Setting.</seg>
<seg id="1425">You can install new & Amarok; install scripts using a script. it will open a selection dialog, in which a script package for installation can be selected. after you have installed the script, a new entry will appear in the list. you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also, equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of functionality can be controlled, for example, via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions, you can either use the command line program dcop, or the somewhat more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in functionality, so your taste and the type of your task are crucial to which of the programs you give the preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you use the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP; functions, you must make sure that & k3b; then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions common to all & kde; program in common, supports & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface from & k3b; provides features such as copyCD, formatted DVD and other features for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Void copyCd () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () void copyrights () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method one gets a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively, a project can be created using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project by using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name) void createFolder (Qstring name, Qstring parent) void addUrl (KURL:: list urls, Qstring parent) void confameItem (Qstring path, Qstring NewName) void setVolume id (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createx CDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder review dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT-addUrl / home / trureceipt / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudio creator; is an audio CD; it is easy to read audio CD; s can easily be read and stored in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are also possible depending on encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudio creator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in wav files on hard disk) and by many encoders that encode these wav files (these encoder packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution). other encoders may be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per title) are compressed into the MP3 or OGG format or in other formats as the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, the reading of the & CD;, will be used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders need to be installed. all these programs are usually already available for any Linux distributions. however, only the encoders need to be installed which are needed. if for example FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? chapter Welcher Kodierer sets a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & ktagged creator; cdparanoia to read out audio data from the & CD; if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device does not handle the protection, it is not possible to avoid a protected audio CD; avoid buying copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting-up only needs to be done once (but the setup dialog can be invoked as often as a suitable configuration is found), the daily handling of reading a & CD will be explained. this will (hopefully) lead to an understanding of the slim approach of the user interface you will often stumble across at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoders are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; retrieve information from the freedb from the internet or work completely without network, with everything recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands from the main window. on the step by step example you can find more information about how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Start the CDDB request of CD data according to the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this may be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the internet first must be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if a encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup index - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">A sub-menu opens with a list of available encoders, so selecting with another encoder can be read as the default. it must be noted that previously the encoder settings in the encoding settings tab was configured in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already selected file is selected for encoding rather than a full & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as Protocols, Piepsen) for Programmer events (such as readout the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different flashcards (such as Encoder, for setting up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter discusses sound quality, encoders and compression rates and helps you choose the right encoders.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is lost, a lossless audio format is required. in addition to FLAC, there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG today may have a slight advantage over mp3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate, the differences become less important since both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is still supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG recording devices is available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music scores, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate around 5.5. requires 256 kbps for complex and less complex tracks of a track. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all tracks of a song. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and autophistics.But not good enough for HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or collected by the program automatically from freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. they can be passed / needed with & ktagged creator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs there is often a combination of program settings for the encoders and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the coding explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add titles to the keyword (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt by lame and the title parameter of & kvideojs; added. the result looks like: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & co-stimulators; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / write the audio CDs, so that everyone else can download the information instead of themselves into the computer. it must be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (editor's note: this is meant by the author) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from getting information from the CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can be obtained anyway on a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kvideocreator; actively selecting an address box (sending an address). for the use of freedb may be used with another (counterfeit) address as the used in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears that the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (this can only be known to the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & ktagged creator; to use freedb, the geographically adjacent mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online call from & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only updates to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is being used; who wants to know more precisely, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution, if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read wav files, the encoders and thus the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), ognc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab for setting the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used. this is also required for pre-defined encoders. more information about Kodierer are in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg. console). you have to replace 'lame' by the name of the installed encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and reading rights on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, ognc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD; check the shell of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything but are somehow still unsure about what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and use our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1.</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine since it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write access to it (eg by trying to copy something inside with the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudio creator; something which is probably done only once, and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each output & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoders to use for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program to download the freedb to download the CD; data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them for each read of a & CD; change if the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look into the file / etc / fstab can help and an attempt with the entries of the device designations for the CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The tab General Settings. here is not much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is loaded / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">"" "only in case of incomplete information, select" "" "Please" "" "so that you will be informed when data on creating keywords (tags) is missing." ""</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the internet from a freedb calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the freedb server while reading the & CD; it must be connected to the internet to access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, becomes a & CD; entry is found, immediately starts reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the directory name / filename or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory and filename will be changed with Konqueror &gt; and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; tag.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to manually enter everything manually, disable the selection boxes and freedb will not be used. however, this is over 620 MB big, consider this twice if this is worth it. to freedb in offline mode, the two selection boxes must be selected, at least the first. mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for calling the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data is to get the CD? read the section on freedb. set everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server nearby. on this path, the load is distributed between the hosts, but this setting will work first.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, as many firewalls encode the protocol 8880 by default, perhaps there is more luck with the protocol 80 as the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to send data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screen shot. (make sure the / tmp folder exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously interpreted pieces: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know, therefore simply try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; check out the last piece: check it to check the & CD; check it out at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must specify the path / folder where the wav files are stored. this can be useful if only space on another drive is present. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances, something must be scrolled to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bit rate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression ratio is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the creation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2 tags can also be deleted if necessary. Kid3 is an excellent' id3 'tag for & kde; in the event of a later change in tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of WAV files to be encoded simultaneously: in a dual core or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to encode more than one WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudio creator; this configuration is used as the default for each reading of a & CD; if you have cleverly chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section we describe how the process of reading the & CD; we will create and set up MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard drive, is set up in the previous section. first, a connection to the internet is built, since we are comfortable and the & CD; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each output & CD; repeat.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from the data collected for a CD; therefore, you will learn the & CD; manually enter data instead of fetching it from the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, the & CD must be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as shown in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as an audio CD; can be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, look for the Help section in the Questions and Answers section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the CD has been successfully picked up by the freedb, all tracks are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; the key to your & CD; a window appears, and you can select the database entry that matches your opinion best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for automatic retrieval of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button on the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you will need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 2: the CD-Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current title', the rest of the data in the 'Album' entry field.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the 'Current title' input field unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The comment field below may be individually mapped for each individual comment, the album's commentary box is used for comments that are common to all tracks of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of data from freedb, the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the screenshot below. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor (e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for comment field. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have set unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudio creator.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders and file formats. see Help with the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously agrees with the style of the read-out CD; in this example this is not important since we do not provide the & CD data anyway. for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data, which we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and album will be shown above the parts list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that it has a check mark before each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line turns off the selection of the piece. make sure all pieces are selected, or press the button All items on the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at one time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Was started by clicking on the button selector selecting the selection process, then this window appears for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what runs out.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab button to switch to the order pane. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the jobs. the first piece is read just on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You will see this error message if you try to work with a encoder you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we entered here in the example. did you check if you have write access to the temporary files and destination folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3. this allows reading and encoding in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. for low-performance machines, the result is unclear. the used computer with an AMD64 appears to have no problem at simultaneous reading and encoding (however, two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the top left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudio creator, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kvideocreator; nowadays, CVS is maintained as part of the kdemultimedia package. however, if you are familiar with CVS, you can download an anonymous copy from there. however, most distributions already include a pre-compiled package, da & kvideojs; install the kdemultimedia package from your distribution. if you are reading this, you probably have already done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at people compiling from source files, and not intended for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs once it runs, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs has many variants of settings. best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it shows screenshots of the different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hi, still reading? even if only the help menu clicked after the first start of the program without any indication of how it should go on from this somehow empty screen (especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD; in the drive), or from an unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it about? who reads this, probably already started the program. it should look something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately, no e-mail. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is considered the first version for a manual to & ktagged creator. if you want to add something useful or change it, let it do. at least only after making contact with the author. and if you are reading this, he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Karaokespieler from & kde; besides others, it also has real-time graphics and karaoke real-time highlighting of texts also some features that other and UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs on & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so should work on all systems with OSS - and & kde; support also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver needed for GUS cards. Alsa is included as soon as it supports a Sequencer.</seg>

<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files (song events or text events). kmid automatically determines the procedure used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. if you want to quit while playing a song, kmid will start again next time with the same song.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window into the & kmid; window will drop. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button on the toolbar, select the Play from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece will automatically start once you drag it to the & kmid; (with several pieces, it will be added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; play one piece, you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and running with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click the arrows left and right of the speed display and change the playback speed. to restore the original tempo, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a play is played, a pressure on the spacebar acts like pressing the button pause or selecting the menu item pause in the menu item, so interrupts playback. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be saved in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use song text and others both. some pieces have no lyrics at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can specify which events should be displayed and even better: the event type will be automatically determined using a song, so you don't have to manually set the karaoke text. however, you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">In case you want to set an event type, select the entries text events or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize, which will be played back in turn. in this section you will see how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you can find it in the menu item under the heading Organize.... Click on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set each one in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not saved. remember this if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the button Add a song. it appears in turn, the file dialog with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When automatically adding to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when opening a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the row from the submenu of the player sequence of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next song button, select the next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the item prediction piece, the item prediction piece from the menu item or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted, but it does not matter as it is not saved when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not general MIDI capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map translates general MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to Bright Piano, in events of the Change patch to Trumpet type, and thus always lets a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM instruments and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately there are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you need to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI Map is a text file that stores all the necessary settings for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the Keymap section, which may appear so often as desired. but the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different TextID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Name of Keymap"... END Define Keymap "Another Keymap"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail so I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not general MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section you will see how General MIDI cartridges are mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the Equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM-patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave blank lines for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is needed to put all sounds that need this instrument to play on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gun.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is meant with the term drum patch of the patch, where each sound represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one where sound means the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards have it).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to specify how tones are displayed on a specific channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important as well as its presence. so you need to create 128 items.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple Keyboards for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">"" "" "" "Keyboards" "" "are used above all to make sounds on the percussion channel. see for example the provided" "" "Keyboards" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map out some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, do this in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the key map with the name Name for this channel will be defined. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events that try to change the patch on this channel will be ignored. in this case, patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio Pitch Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a Pitch Bender event with the value n, this is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM pretends that a keyboard, which receives a pitch benchmarking event with the value 4096, should play a note higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two notes up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. this can be found in the Settings menu, point MIDI Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards see which sounds are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a drop-down list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button no longer lights up green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views (up to now) to display the played sounds. in the Settings menu, select Settings under the item Channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD indicates the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so, for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, etc;. this allows the same MIDI file to perform very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone to use kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality. with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, speed, etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid. that happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example, by kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no desire to add all the files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, so support & kmid; drag and drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, activate Automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down the playback. to restore the standard speed, double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & konqueror; -Desktop with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a MIDI file) or tacked (if I want to play a karaoke file) or if I want to play a file, just change into the & konqueror; change the window and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you only want to quickly listen to a file without adding it to a collection, turn the setting Automatic addition to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. First you just want to play the first file. so set the setting Automatic addition to the collection and open A.Ther. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play B.mid and C.mid, and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, it animates me to write on & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.com Larrosa.Jimenez; I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Malaga. at the moment I'm in the third year, so I don't have much time for my hobbies but I'm trying to take a bit of time. as hobbies I have programming, collecting MIDI files, making music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or if you just want to make me happy, send me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">They make me really excited when you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will list under Friends of & kmid. before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me as I may have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I've written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and won't get money from anyone. I want to emphasize that I only keep programming because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch at AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the GIS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Marc Diefenbruch, Peter Gritsch, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, error notification or even a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course I would like to thank all these excellent musicians on the net, who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, & kmid can also be found on his homepage, which is located at http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, search for information and view images. you will also find links to other karaoke songs, etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it's not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you do not have a sound card, you need to compile & kmid; compile with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can of course not hear music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; -mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& SME; is a simple user interface for MPlayer, Phono and FFMPEG. the program is used to play video files from MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, as well as to play DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished as & kde; installed on this machine.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help, please check the page The KDE website on new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called doable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is a window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that is displayed only when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the favorite links under the Bookmarks menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Continuous Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional level of hierarchies. if you have an entry, your group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and the playback begins with the associated entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current play ', TV and continuous playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course you can only do that if & SME; not running. the different files in the ~ / .kde / share / KMViewer / / directory can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself. simply click on a name of a category, click on it from the View menu and next edit mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you need to select playlists from the menu and select either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when editing mode leaves or another group is selected without adjusting the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the author's convenience, some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during startup and exit can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / kmplayerrc and change [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & SME; will keep the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMplayer / verb.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMViewer / exit.xml; the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup does not need to be short, it is automatically ended by opening another source. this would be annoying at the end-animation however, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; smilgt; & lt; bodygt; & lt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smil</seg>

<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'Console' in the toolbar of SMB. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & SME; everything has to be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / kmplayerrc, like setting up the backend via mimetype. here is an example of how a 'flash' with the swf dec-mozilla module is played:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within and SMEs; it can even add the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">For the & SME; 'flash' to play in HTML pages, the & SME needs to be specified as a service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file Assignments of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & SME; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library. the started process is called pop player. if there are no errors, the backend output is inside & SMB; (View, console, or console from context menu to check).</seg>
<seg id="1726">To ensure that a given backend is always taken for a specific mime type (of course only if this is also determined), this must be done by manual modification of the file ~ / .kde / share / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& SME; can be played by TV cards, either by MPlayer or XVideo (this requires kxvplayer). before TV can be stowed, the device to use must be configured and the TV channels. for this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (video data recorder) settings in the KMplayer, the dialog appears in the Settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be detected ports from which one is selected. the encoding must be found (e.g. it's PAL for Western Europe), the correct name probably contains a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since VDR support for SMEs can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (presumably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux expansion must be functional for the X server. therefore, the XFree86 server must contain the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, SMEs are used for different names for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, this dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlresource, vcdsource and vd source. when enabled, they start playing the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1743">Most of these components can be included in the used & Linux distribution. for the installation, the documentation of the distribution or installation CD should be used; / DVD should be used.</seg>
<seg id="1744">The & Kile; Project includes some pre-compiled packages from & Kile; for different distributions. these allow easy installation without further compiling and are included on the box; -website.</seg>
<seg id="1745">This manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with & latex;, & kde;, & Kile; or & Linux;.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Advanced users do not have to read this manual. however, all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account. if the support for this project or its documentation is desired, the contact should be made via the box; -website.</seg>
<seg id="1747">If you have questions about the compilation of & Kile; on or if extensions are requested, this should be addressed at the mailing list Kile-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net.</seg>
<seg id="1748">& Kile; is an integrated & latex; environment for the latex; desktop. & Kile; provides the ability to use all & latex; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple, immediate and customized access to all & latex; programs. finally, the easy-to-use assistant, the & latex; reference and the powerful project management have to be called.</seg>
<seg id="1749">To learn more about & kate; and to learn its possibilities the manual should be consulted to Kate. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of & kate; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1750">For natural latex; is the right pronunciation: Lay-TECH. while the original & tex; difficult to use, a layman (inlay) & latex; -macros can also be used. a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it derives from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">While only a good overview of natural latex is given, it is not the ultimate book to do so. to be properly proficient, good books such as H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999 should be used.</seg>
<seg id="1752">Just like other markup languages includes & latex; an introduction with which the general features like paper format, page numbering and text size can be specified as well as a body with the text. the introduction includes at least the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed with the command\\ end {document} and must be closed with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The quick-entry assistant at & Kile; is an useful feature for fast creation of a document in & Kile; The selection of the wizard (MenÃ ¼) provides some options for the creation of the document. it can also be made some settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this defines the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], letter [letter], report [report], report [scrartcl], book (DIN) [scrreprt], projector [beamer], slides [Prosper] or user defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: the encoding of the system is set. the encoding of the system should be used. modern systems increasingly use the UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best UTF-8X should be used (for proper processing of the & latex; documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the usually used auxiliary packages for and latex; for the integration, they have to be selected only in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), report (DIN), letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations). they should always be used in the preparation of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry. it's just a brief description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; offers - as well as other source code editors - the highlighting of the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the inappropriate). by & Kile; if you see larger areas of a gray text on the screen, it is quite likely that any mathematical environment is not closed. however, it will be spared by the modest appearance of the output file. however, you will save time and money by highlighting.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With the automatic execution of the environment, a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) by & Kile; automatically creates a blank line (for the input of the text) and the corresponding line for setting the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be set in the menu settings box; set up LaTeX commands.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the highest and subparagraph the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of a mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own and latex files, the recovery search can be very helpful. as soon as a DVI; file [germany-dependent file (engl. D e V ice I ninterdependent File)] is created, jumps & box; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer to the corresponding line in the latex; -source.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the output types of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools to view, convert and print out DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the back search, the elements of the DVI; file are selected to the editor and as soon as an element is clicked in the DVI; file, the corresponding section is skipped in the latex; the source code is clicked to the corresponding point in the DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document the work is simplified with others .tex files. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick build: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless there are no source code errors).</seg>
<seg id="1768">Video surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file will be called "" "" "" "or" "" "-" "" "and there is no call from & eyepiece; after the quick build." ""</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit toolbar, the three large selection fields should be noticed. the selection boxes were developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document. the first selection box is for fast structure of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available and latex commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection field Additional is for inserting items such as keywords, footnotes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command creates a description for a section, an image, or a different element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified term (selection of a selection field possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list with literary entries is displayed. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. for editing & bibtex; files corresponding editors are necessary. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection field with the name GrÃ ¶ vone is used for the definition of the font. the fonts can be specified for the main text, the notes etc., the following fonts are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written from the ground up by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets following the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the fonts. if the fonts are not specified at the beginning, this can also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code sample has been entered, the & latex needs to be compiled. the simplest way to do this is to use the menu build or the button's quick build.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling. & Kile; automatically triggers the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compilation of the document fails, the logging must be checked after the errors. when using quick build, & eyepiece; should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is different from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} may be attributed to the approximation of the fonts within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes will only be maintained within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}. there is no limit (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the legibility and ease of use of the document. for example, certain fonts, bold prints, passive printing, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is valid for the startup printing and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a sentence can be displayed italicid with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {ratio} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source text with the & latex; markup language was presented, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text was entered in the wizard, some adjustments should be made for the better readability of the document. for this, a quote, a few places in bold and cursive printing and a poem can be used to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, it can be returned to the editor by using the editor's View or Ctrl E (on the internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try it and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (engl. D e V ice I ninterdependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI, the same steps are necessary as for the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed by file printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file is created from the & latex; source text, the conversion into changed other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The search warrant permits direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a suitable setting for all & latex; bindings. for this, only Modern is set up under Settings Box... Tools Building should be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to execute the search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source text and then clicked on for preference. the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI; viewer takes place then.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Using this function in & eyepiece; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document from & Kile; be opened and jumped to the corresponding line. to do this, & Kile; in & eyepiece; set up as text editor (Setting the eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If the use of quick build-up of the & DVI; the viewer does not open, an error can be present. if an error is present, this will be summarized in the logging file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file stores the source of error in the source. in the editor you can then use LaTeX errors and LaTeX errors for sprÃ ¼ nge between the errors. the logging file always specifies the line in which the error appears. to view the faulty line, the error in the logging must be clicked and & Kile; jumps to the defective row.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once you clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window appears to select the template you want to use for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or used by the wizard to quickly create a new document. more information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Common User of & latex; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created in & Kile; templates can be created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file needs to be opened or a new file created. & Kile; can create a new template by dragging an existing document and selecting file template from document... creating.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using File New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings Box... Settings can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering into document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be taken:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the standard one.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created. a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and searched through the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & kate; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & cate; can be made in the menu directly from & Kile; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & kate; and to experience its possibilities the manual should be consulted to Kate. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of & kate; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be called through the menu help LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex; they can be used as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double click with a twisted Ctrl key to select the & tex; this means that by clicking on\\ par of\\ par\\ bigskip only\\ par will be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with left mouse button, the selected text will be copied automatically to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with the right Shift key, parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to search and highlight the most different kinds of source texts. for example, the latex commands differ from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional jumping marks. this is a unique type of bookmarks within the text. the menu items Edit Favorites or the respective keys allow the jump to the next or last jump mark. this is also highlighted with this jump mark, so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the key aspects when using a program like & Kile; although & kate; already excellent features have been added in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source text is added; special commands for their selection. under Edit dropouts, the following commands for text selection are included:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Select a complete paragraph (group of lines containing an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning does not include a text with persistent lines (as in other text editors). this extended meaning includes tables, and latex commands, and all other lines of the source text. the only preventative action in & Kile; is that the paragraphs are separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also exits & latex; -Commands with a return line (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, of course, it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & kate; offers the key Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & Kile; provides with its own commands for faster possibility. under Edit delete, the following commands are included for the deletion of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Deletes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is included in the description of the selected paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile; for more commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with natural latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command jumps to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command jumps to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command for the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or inside the\\ begin {environment} command, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering a lot of nested ambient commands, the overview can be lost quickly. this command will close the last modified environment, so that the nested ambient structure will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups specified by braces {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that match those from editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command jumps to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command jumps to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curly clasp clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the curly clip of a & tex; group # is jumped to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering a lot of nested grouped parentheses, the overview can be lost quickly. this command will close the last modified group so that the nested structure of the tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple application marks are used as manners. for the beneficial implementation is used in & Kile; the sign 'is used for two simple application marks. also for ending the request the sign' is used. & Kile; knows this case and for two conclusive quote characters for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of double quote characters can be set up under Settings Box... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">You can also use foreign-specific settings (e.g. German or French) and German or French reference marks. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When pressing Shift; Enter key & Kile; an intelligent line break. if the current position is located within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not only a line break but also the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a table environment close & box; the current line with\\\\ with a close line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is smart enough to support pre-set & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be added under Settings Box; set up LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to sort the columns in tables -environments and thereby arrange all the Et character (amp;) among each other. when pressing Shift; Alt; amp; looks & kile; after the next tab in the adjacent line. although this tablator is not the added one, add & box; some space for the columns position of the current tablature.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already offering good source code completion, this has been added in & Kile; for special commands (mostly for & latex;) even extended. three of them work as needed and the other two are for automatic processing. all these modes can be set up for different modes of operation under Settings Box... fully terminated.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment will begin with the command\\ begin {environment} & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back key, the last letter of the input will be removed and, understandably, the complete list will be gratified. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions are removed by selecting a command. alternatively, von & Kile; also jump marks can be inserted, so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by means of the Edit butt tag and the desired parameters can then be added.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Box; set up... Kile; Complete Settings can be made to these lists. it can be used to select different WÃ ¶ rst lists for & tex; - and & latex; commands as well as storages of general language use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not necessary for the execution of environments. there are always a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the call to complete destruction mode will result in a large list with environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for completing the environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the full-service mode over the menu, complete surroundings or the key-root Alt + Shift key, the command is automatically inserted in the environment and it appears to\\ begin {. after that, the environment can be continued in a very simple way and by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">After this is done, the environment is automatically closed again. once & Kile; detects that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command is added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings box; set up... Kile; Complete Settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of the processing mode for & tex; - and & latex; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; support user-defined lists of heaters, which are immediately replaced by longer strings. lists can be set up under Settings Box... file example.cwl, in which, for example, the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is typed and the word processing mode is initiated through the menu or the single Ctrl + Alt key, the letter L will be replaced by the character string\\ LaTeX.</seg>

<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting is removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies periodically so that in case of a power failure or crash, the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file. also for unsaved documents, a backup is created regularly, according to the set time.</seg>

<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the structure tree settings the visibility of nodes in the tree can be adjusted, the update frequency of the tree during editing and how deep in a change of the structure tree is to be opened. empty nodes are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area to specify abbreviations (a type of template) that will be deployed when editing to larger text. abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s. this means there may be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifclause abbreviation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plug-ins can be managed. plugins are Kpart applications from third page, which can be reused by any Kpart-enabled application, the most known & konqueror; when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin when starting, so it can open the current file, the associated folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load the component in "read-only" mode: check if the plugin refuses to load. only-Read-Parts usually refuse to load if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is enabled, test & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct, then save the application even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, debugging has been completely redesigned. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger has been set, as well as support for the DBG debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept has been implemented that allows different implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, which includes support for the use of & guise; inquantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable debugger plugin in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin selection box, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points are listed with line numbers and conditions. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the debugger, anything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">This action makes the connection to the debugger if necessary, or it tells the plugin to listen to debug requests. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so normally you don't have to pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugging session Starts the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates the listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens, while the script is stopped, execution will continue. if a debugger is started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to begin executing the script without sending information to the monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens, while a script is stopped, execution starts. if a debugger is given, the execution starts once a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The Debugger executes the next statement in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The Debugger executes the next statement in the script, with it being corrected in functions and include.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the statement and go to the next as if there were not the current.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered that is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>

<seg id="2013">Specify the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each and lt; attr &gt; tag). the item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each column; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Returns a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Returns a list of elements that end a tag. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and need to be neatly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces don't influence anything, but look for & and & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, and & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not cause a break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is the top in the & quantaplus; to start windows and check TagXML. another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not currently available. currently, the check is only performed when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Below is an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this tag XML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file a & PHP; loading function is described. the filename of this tag XML file should be overload.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The file descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD's Edit DTD settings. with this, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & descriptionrc; for a newly created & descriptionrc; should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = User 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD specification. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name will be used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be created with settings actions... can be created. click New action leading to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The keyboard shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking the Custom button, a key shortcut can be assigned; with Keiner the current shortcut is removable.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the modeled settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action you can start external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) to use the document or use it as input (or parts of the document). examples from & quantaplus; even are the Quick Start dialog or the different See in... Actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way, try & quantaplus; the script at: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; process. if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text unique is added to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can be input from & quantaplus; in the input field input can be determined which is to be sent to the default input. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written on the standard output; error messages, to the standard error output. it can be specified what to do with the text written on the standard output by setting the output field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the brand.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings to set up actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. pressing the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you plan to use it, enable" "" "Edit Tag" "" "dialog if available so that input is possible when using the action." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the menu, Graphics Other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Editing Size other.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the start of the day, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green it is usually displayed as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least indicate a message to the user that clicking on this symbol will be inserted; -day in the current document will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action. this is done via the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. in addition to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, as there are which ones, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar, or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separators. open the toolbar dialog using Settings Toolbar. make sure that the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the item to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to give you a quick way to access the Konqueror Preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how separators support the grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar can believe that the counterqueror; -button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar has to be tested by using all of the symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">After new XML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust their file descriptionrc; so that their toolbar (s) will be loaded (n) if a file is opened from the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most worth mentioning extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you might be able to check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has done that for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to search an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. we will leave the first part to you, we will handle the second one here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation html files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these documentation e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation section 1 = func.html tag1 = func.html tag2 = tag.html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see in the & PHP; documentation something like this:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing, but look for & and & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resource files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file which is used to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is displayed. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (context list) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of contextual elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / Quanta / doc for local and global use. then create a folder (as you specified it in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that they are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, such as which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; community. you won't get rich, but be proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the failed resources (DTEP packets, toolbar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. in different jobs there is an Email menu item that sends DTD DTD-package (DTEP) with email, tool bar tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions are checked and only made available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication. to make a major contribution we recommend to sign the resources, for which there is a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of resources is ensured, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not stored), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can choose one. in the dialog new resource, you need to fill out the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Upload can be uploaded from the DTD DTD-package (DTEP) from the DTD's DTD package, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, examined & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be aborted. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in XML format. there's the easiest way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from DTD Load and Convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that is to be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitional line: the string that should appear in! doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine setting of the DTEP after conversion: when enabled, & quantaplus; after converting the file descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are a few key concepts. in order to understand them and take full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarise themselves with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts without their understanding and quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus; all that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool lists, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be anything from & CSS, patterns up to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most constrained size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which empowers the joint use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the editor window, the tree view, the tabs with information and the toolbar. please consult, and for more detailed information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a contextual menu with the current document, like closing the current, other or all the tabs, reloading, deleting or uploading the document, jumping to a bookmark or executing CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the Editor area lead to a further context menu concerning the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste / paste), edit the text under the mouse-cursor, or open the file if the string is called a file under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of tool lists is shown. in the course of the further expansion of the Editorfensters, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; insert in your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. now you can insert the data for this just added tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (like anchors), you can fill in a dialog various fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The design views (QIT;) allow you to navigate to the information about & quantaplus; to navigate it, open it and browse it. in the presentation with tabs are available for files, project, pattern templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; it displays all files in the project and allows the management of files in the project by right mouseclick. actions such as Add, Remove, Upload or Delete the files from the storage medium can be done with the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option from & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website, etc; All possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on where they are used. global Templates are always available, local templates are only available for the respective user and templates in projects are only usable in the project. more on templates can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of reintegration in Global, Lokal and Project works also here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script. via the right mouse button more functions are available, such as the script to start, edit or email it.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking an element the cursor is placed on the position of the element. by right-clicking an element opens a list of commands related to navigation and refresher the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. it can quickly change attributes and namespaces with it. the content-oriented entry system allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project specific documentation can be added, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed using the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; -scripts that are executed give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bar is extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command displayed. the chocolate-side of the toolbar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the tool bar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail; and if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can secure and load them in & quantaplus; like any other!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus. to do this autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 is located in the PATH in front of your bin folder. the same goes for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE interface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, expandable markup language editor would? well, this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now already well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for this the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; Developer community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good application of free software, the idea of why develop what someone else has developed, but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to dramatically speed up the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation can be increased almost every task. by the program commanders, they can expand & quantaplus; (read more about it in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for fast web development and has been rapidly expanded into a mature editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>

<seg id="2114">& Quanta; currently being developed and supported by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick-access list of files that you have opened. this list changes each time you open a file that is not on it, with the oldest entry being removed.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. check the section on templates. if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts when inserting from the clipboard there, converted special characters to & HTML; -write, so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard into & URL; spelling, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first and foremost to insert & URL; s in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to / off. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script releases error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a sort of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expression to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you see the display of script actions and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Extension and Switching of the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a click of a mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents are grouped in the menu according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; -projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Browse the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows you to copy graphics files to your project folder or subfolder, and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded additional input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; managed by the project. in the chapter & quantaplus; projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are kept in project / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or Project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. it only creates the name. actions need to be added by settings actions... or you will be asked when you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Remove a toolbar from the field of view. this will not delete them from the disk. if you have not yet saved the toolbar, you will be asked if you would like to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; -Team so that the toolbar can be present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows tool bar uploading to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; that made you or anyone else and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be refreshed, without renewing the whole & DTEP. if this is global and does not exist in the global KDE directory, the loading will fail.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded toolbar. if the default (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day preferences dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activating or deactivating the smart insert of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; inserting by means of tools is denied if this tag contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items listed above. click on them. clicking an activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the current version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line identification. very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document on the basis of the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in KDE libraries, switching can sometimes take time or cause unnice graphics. it is recommended that card card mode, which is also the default setting, or subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open sub-window. selecting an entry will enable the corresponding subwindow to be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Enables the status bar to be displayed at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect any application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Aligns the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate; find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar, or which ones can be added and the sequences can be changed.</seg>

<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local filesystem to the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. in case of server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Do not hook up if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project will be included. if a project is started from scratch, do not hook up.</seg>
<seg id="2165">This option displays all files and folders within the main folder and you can make an exact choice of coupons.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This displays a list of files in the root folder. you can select the files you want by hook or, by removing the tick, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new Project Wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be changed in the menu with Project Properties menu in the subwindow Profiles or using the Shift key; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders is possible), which are ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, also files listed in .cvsignor are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view that is loaded when opening the project. it can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the desired debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plugin can be set with the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the sub-window profiles, upload profiles (see in) can be set, as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by hasting one's own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, event actions can be activated and these actions can be added, altered or deleted. event actions are executed when a certain event occurs, such as backing up a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, it opens & quantaplus; the last project that has been opened. this behavior can not be affected at this time.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the menu Project or Open Project File Open from the toolbar. the Open Project dialog is displayed and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if & quantaplus; changed files will be found. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project manager gives free access to the files in the project. there the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries Open and Open with... in the context menu that can be activated with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Enables removal of the current profile. if only one profile exists, the button is removed to prevent removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten when it comes to Programming. this option is useful if frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the disk drive option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many upload profiles can be created and the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog displays:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name on which the files are to be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for upload. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety, this is either a time-saving function or danger. use it after your discretion. the password is stored on the disk concealed so that it can't be read easily, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. it can give many views in a project, i.e. by simple exchange of view various files and tool lists can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored, opened or deleted from the Project or Project Toolbar, accessible via Settings Toolbar Project Toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of the & quantaplus; with which you have the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to your own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, tool bar in & quantaplus; best stackable through the toolbar. use and addition differ. adding toolbar boxes will be treated at the bottom of the section Adding toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the icons on it can be set by either context menu (right click on the toolbar), where other actions such as toolbar can be removed, toolbars can be removed, toolbars can be inserted, which results in the dialog, where it can be specified, which actions should be visible on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries action will additionally be removed and action processed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings Toolbar... and settings can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code cutlets and files to link. & quantaplus; uses templates basically like a common filesystem with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move, or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations you imagine for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. more information about the template tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be of any text document type. based on these templates, new documents can be created. typically, more specialized documents can be created in appropriate subfolders. one makes a simple framework for the purpose and arranges the work in a corresponding way to be efficient. some examples may be found in the template tree below global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of template is useful if not a new document is to be pasted based on a template but the same text area repeatedly in the documents. you can find everything from a comment to a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples are available in the template tree among global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for entire sites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure as you like (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook, etc;.) and choose File As template save as a local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has happened, you will notice that (even if it was saved as a project template), the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the template tree under Project Templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template save selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can simply be dragged along with dragging and dragging on the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: copy the file into a template folder. it can be used for all file management functions, such as dragging and dropping or pasting over the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project files and select a site template, enter a name for the template and secure it. by default, it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can also be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very target-oriented approach. you can prefix headers and footers or dynamically connect with & PHP; create, insert or link files with them. in addition, you can keep track of some things while using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in subwindow templates is based on the files laid in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / .kde / share / apps / quanta / templates / templates. each folder corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder in the template list, right click on the folder and select Properties from the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three types previously described; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded as soon as parental attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the root folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set up, it would basically disable templates in this path unless they are explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text component. if nothing appears, you will probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows preordered or illustrated text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project and enables by copying of content templates into a folder with special headers / footers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (pointing right mouse button) over a full command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & Source text editor available from the View menu. the first mode replaces the source editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; side and a cursor. then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor, where the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document that contains & PHP; contains, a small green symbol indicates the default of & PHP; source text. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP; it is not possible to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible in both the source editor and the VPL; editor and the cursor in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor is activated, this mode is already active, the keystroke offset the active cursor from one window to the other, while maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor can be adjusted via settings Quanta.... When choosing VPL, you can choose between synchronization with one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the web page, it is possible to select the document properties. this allows editing of invisible tags when working with the VPL; editor is also called when a new document is created with the VPL; editor. this is used to reduce the manual coding.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click into the list allows to change the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating the appearance of pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons under the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported yet.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS stylesheet by pressing the file-open button and selecting the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">Using the cursor is possible as in a word processor, due to moving with the arrows. under rare circumstances the cursor acts as usual. the marking functions as usual. text can be inserted by inserting and deleting by return button or remover key.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way through the toolbar, as in the source text editor. it must be noted that inserting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor day, surrounded with text, must be removed any other returning anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tool lists such as the table assistant or the Listen Assistant are disabled. they will later work in the & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists must be used toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for studying style sheets. unlike other style sheets, the search for certain elements is possible and the style template can be traced.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts during merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see exactly what had changed inside these lines. and there was no indication of where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within one line and changes to white marks. later, many other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it into one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function converted & kdiff3; almost to a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (base) helps & kdiff3; when automatically selecting the correct changes. the merge editor among the differences windows allows you to resolve conflicts and at the same time displays the result to be expected. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screen shot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you to merge and merge complete folders. this screen shot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently have to check Kode, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are displayed visibly. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left. (no more trouble if someone changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are located in different folders, then you can simplify the typing work by writing only the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 Folder 1 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 3 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 3 Folder Folder Folder Folder Folder Folder Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 3 Folder Folder Folder Folder Folder 2</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows for manually typing filenames, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog will remember your selection and show it next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">By clicking the Folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons and merging of folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A, for B and C, however, a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is enabled, the input field is active for target and can be edited. however, it is not necessary to define immediately a output file. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Configuration button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard to the active comparison window. the comparison then begins immediately. in the opening dialog, you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively large effort. you'd have to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at the moment, you can remove nothing from & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and pasting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Window C is optional.) Each Info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest over the line for a while. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, one sees the color which file is different. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files. that's good to see in the next section (merging).</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line dividing the merge column from the text is interrupted at places where the respective source file has no rows. if the line breaks are activated, the line will be dotted with a broken line.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the inscription text:, the filename and [changes] when you have edited the result. usually, it already contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is deactivated!!! (use the buttons to find the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, every difference at the same time must also be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the line will be selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also highlight a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group otherwise would not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current pane and on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or by manual processing; then it will be displayed in these lines of text & lt; No line in the queue; this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a marking you may copy and paste somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if the options are ignored when selecting the sources or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate primarily with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side up, end, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the delivery window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. with the insertion key, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns will synchronize the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigating with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-above), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-picture backwards) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking to the clipboard, press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Paste). there is also the option selection automatically copied. if this is checked, you will automatically copy the option to the clipboard and no manual copying. be careful with this option, because you could overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use carriage return + newline drive\\ r\. KNO3 keeps the line endings of the source files, therefore you should not use & kdiff3; also not with binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the last used files will be saved automatically at the exit and restored at the next start. (menu Settings - &gt; KNO3- Set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences are displayed in italic script. if the selected font does not support this representation, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered more astray. on these systems, the button presets automatically sets an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the indentation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which type of line you prefer to save. default value is the commonly used selection of the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3 first attempt to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step white characters will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character '\' and a line feed '\' at the end of a line, while others save only one line feed '\'. if this option is enabled, the car returns will be made visible, but like a white character. during merging this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the first part of the analysis, the numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. as a result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">By default, this option is disabled. changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Search intensely after even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before jumping on to the next unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically dissolves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files. if you only need this from time to time, use the functions Choose A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are covered in the chapter to scan folders and execute a merge. for details see documentation on how to compare and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and an older version already exists, the original version will be appended to suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further fuse.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapt the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you need & kdiff3; quit and restart, so that the change becomes active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language there is set globally over the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">The code for encoding provides a quick note of what the local encoding is. (this cannot be changed here and has an informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this will affect how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option one can set the coding of the output of preprocessor commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress highlighting of changes in white notes in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded overview column. but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files. after selection of A & lt; gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is displayed next to the normal yet another check column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. just leave the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arrange the comparison panels side by side or overlap each other. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the Windows menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then instantly decide to merge the files. merge current file in the merge menu also works if you only compare two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as preset name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart merging, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor that exactly matches your requirements. you can use this function e.g. for cutting off disturbing parts or correcting indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it will be given to this remote command first. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is used only with the line balance. you can write your own pre-processor that exactly matches your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff-results. however, an external program is needed and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for line interception to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Ups the found text in uppercase.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all sequences follow the same pattern $keyword (\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you are experimenting with sed, you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KNO3. but it is good as an example for a further pre-processing command for line about. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character between' [and ']' is a hit, so every hit is replaced by nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something different, e.g. perl -p -e's / regexp / Regexp / Regexp / Regexp / Regexp / Regexp / Regexp / Regexp / Regexp / Regexp / Regexp / Regexp / Regexp / Regexp / Regexp only (and) without the preceding '\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor is retained for the display and for merging. subsequent operations only change the data that the line intercessor provides.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when you use a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences, you may inadvertently notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit a lot of files in one folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge complete folders with & kdiff3; complete folders.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and show the simulated changes without actually carrying out,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... execute selected actions with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the File dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 will be used as a base. if no target folder has been specified, use & diff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not merging. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">When you read the folder, a small message window informs about the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folders, only the files that have been compared until then are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folders is finished, & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can open a folder by double-clicking on the + / - or by double-clicking on the item or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All sub-directories can be opened and all sub-directories can be opened and / or opened.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The name in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this kind again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, however, the color is identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identically if their entire content is identical. then folders have the same color. for folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is green, then yellow becomes and later, when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronizing mode is active when only two folders and no explicit destination folder are specified and if the option directories are synchronized. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that afterwards both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees only B as visible filenames for the output file; copied directly after merging & cres3; B after A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merging (unsure) is enabled, then examine & diff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the date is identical. if such errors are not eliminated, the merge of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">When merging, one file is processed after the other. it displays the status column heed--if the merge is successful, and other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis, Kdiff3 will display other columns. these contain the number of unsolved, deleted, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not specify a destination folder, then in the Three-folder merging mode C is used as the target, B will be chosen as the target and A and / or B will be used as the target when synchronizing.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that could be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: start / continue directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to just merge the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If by conflicting file types still invalid merging actions exist, a message appears that indicates the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box will appear with the Browse, Simulate and Cancel options.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Choose Simulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window will open (note the screen shot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select start / continue directory merge, or press F7. if you have not yet saved, a corresponding dialog will appear. then, execute & kdiff3; resume its work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; hit an error, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list see some error messages that will help you skip the cause of the problem. if you continue merging again (F7 key), & kdiff3; you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before proceeding with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged, comments & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and will not execute them again at the later compilation of all entries. even if the merge operation has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered settled. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu from & kdiff3; (set up menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the elemental tree. multiple patterns can be entered. separate the patterns with a semicolon; valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders don't have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elemental tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elemental tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that would also be ignored by CVS. many self-generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder is specific to a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hiding attribute. in other file systems, a preceding point is marked as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the elemental tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to files: when the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is enabled, the symbolic links will be compared. if the option is enabled, the links will be treated as normal folders and searched for recursively. (note that & kdiff3; if the option contains a link to itself would result in an infinite loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of deleted, unsolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than simple binary analysis, and much slower as it is applied to files that do not contain text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the modification date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security. please use caution. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">There is no real comparison. the files are considered identically when they are equal. this can be useful, for example, if the change date has been lost when copying. please use caution. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activate the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified. in this mode, the merge suggestions are selected in such a way that afterwards both folders are identical. the results of merging files will also be saved in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging, the copying of the newer file is suggested as action. (this is considered unsafe, as it is assumed that the other file has not been modified.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version will be renamed and will receive the extension .orig. If an old backup file with the .orig extension is already existing, it will also delete the normal merge of individual files, not just the merging of entire folders. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder merging view remains visible during the merge of individual files; you can shift the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want this, you can turn off the directory & text window and switch between the main window in the Windows menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. however, in the -menu, there is also a corresponding menu entry. you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge. as soon as you save the result, the status will be reset and the file will not be merged once you run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status will be lost if you re-read the directory: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. this way you can specify files and folders to open that are on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file to an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. you should note a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contained. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be escaped. (# - &gt;% 23, space character &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. there is a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link appears on a file or folder. then a file will always be accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modification dates. therefore, the permissions or modification dates deviate from the original. (please refer to the Confidential of the Size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently the difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select in KDEVELOP from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is applied as a part, & kdiff3; assuming that the input file is a patch file in unified format. then remove & kdiff3; the name of the original files must exist. then, & kdiff3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Preview into - KDiff3Part. note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; being executed as part, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in Kpart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KNO2 (now called Compare) are already available. in addition, the name Kdiff3 already indicates that it can run together like the diff3 program from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or get it that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the source and probably didn't tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in default configure configure in / usr / local, but then KDE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are first treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. iF similar lines and next to each other, this is more often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor remembers for every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this is necessary to solve a conflict by simply clicking into the source text and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was so far too large. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to process greater amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text, it is suddenly gone; no src has been left, and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; already uses many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">In order to be able to use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDE on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You will find a list of recent changes under http: / / kdiff3 sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install & kdiff3; to compile and install on a system, use the following command in the & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake use, you should not have any problems with compiling. if difficulties persist, please report to the & kde; mailing lists thereof.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Removal) copies into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) inserts text from the clipboard to the current cursor position or replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you will need to re-read the update folder after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries showing differences. this also causes identical files to be copied to the target folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging.

<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new functions. it is optimized for use on low-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">If you like & kste; start, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & kmag; displays the enlarged area of the screen. below, this window is referred to as the magnifying window. the image shown in the magnifying window is an enlarged portion of the screen and is referred to as the selection box below.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting, you may enlarge the area around the mouse pointer as a moving magnifying glass. alternatively, you may & kmay; cause a selected area of the screen in the magnifier window (drop-down mode) or the surroundings of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; at the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window, select the mouse pointer setting. please note that this may not be able to detect the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default cde; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can adjust the selection box to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifier window and keep the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifier window. this is also possible with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally use the & Shift; press the key or the & MMB; use it, you can move the selection box.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner can be moved.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& kmay; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer, save to a file, copy it to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Start or stop the update of the ad. stopping the update results in the needed CPU time against 0.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click once the mouse pointer stops for a while at the same location. it is intended to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also be caused by the mere moving of the mouse. suffer from pain that is associated with your computer's use, you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear again: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">Using & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and triggers a mouse click as soon as you interrupt the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the smart move enabled, makes & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button. this way you can drag the dragging with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click executes.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligentes is switched on, the shooting time will be active (1 / 10 s). here the time will be set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button wait before it releases the mouse button again if no moving the mouse takes place.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking through mouse shift. if this function is enabled, a slow moving to the right and back creates a double click. this moves will be stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt if & kmousetool; the first time is started but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound appears delayed, you can & kde; to shorten the response time, go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the General tab. there is a slider sound buffer that lets you adjust to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool; started at every start from & kde; this function is currently only available at & kde; this function is currently only available at & kde; please consult the respective documentation at GNOME or other window environments to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the Apply button, the settings will reset to the state after the last pressing of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The best way to do this is to use the preadjustments. in particular, the smart move should be turned off. if you have become used to the automatic mouseclick, you can later remove the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response time of & kde; with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should be aware of where a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not represent a link will not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore use the mouse to park in such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to remove the mouse ball. as it happens, mouse to mouse varies. it should be clear, however, if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would need to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and the dirt can scrape you easily with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you are using the smart move in this case, it means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer end by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you perform a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool, and you can continue to work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: when you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another location.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it. but park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to use a keyboard input. thus, accidental moving of mouse clicks can cause unwanted reactions. secure zones for the mouse cursor are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbar and menus and the front lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart move, but I don't make it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can handle it. it's very likely to copy text, copy it to the clipboard, or perform any other action you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using & kmousetool; to use. select text instead like this: execute a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and clicking again the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the mouse click to listen. this will be used every time & kmousetool; the mouse button will press a sound like a mouse click. later, you will be able to use the smart move even without the mouse click. but this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool, the Xtest extension for & X Window needs to be installed, which should already be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer is briefly harmed. this program has been developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and who are causing pain to antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait a certain amount of time waiting for a pulling process to start before releasing the mouse button. this way, drag and drop can also be performed with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2619">String replacement filters provide a good way in & ktts; wrong accented or incorrect pronouncing messages. the file kmail.xml, which is included in the delivery of & ktts; is a good example. you remove the tags br and b from the messages sent by e-mail, and also the expression / local / inbox, as this can be assumed in most cases as presumed.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced features of ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters, text is processed before being sent to speech-schedulers. they are useful for improving pronunciation in order to replace incorrect spoken words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain deficiencies of voice synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"" "to understand how filters work, it is important to know how the program" "" "speech-patcher" "" "works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other applications and holds these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the continued orders will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will resume after issuing the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you can read a long text on a web page, you can welcome with & kmouth; someone who just enters the room. & kde; notifications are also messages.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. every order you connect from the card card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are executed in queues except for the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader while & ktts; just read such a file, this output is stopped and stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there can be even further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String replacements replace parts of a text with other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; will allow the creation of chat emoticons such as: -) by text or for reformatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converters use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format. included in the delivery of & ktts; are some XSLT files for translation of & XHTML; contained in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With subscriber selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to & ktts; for example, if you have set a female voice on the card speaker phone, you can read text from KDE news about it. read more about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied to a voice output. if the filter specifies that its rules do not apply, it will pass the text unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text assignment, message, warning or a & cde; -notification to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters created on the bottom. processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the established regular filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and the subsequent setup dialogs will be shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting string replacement filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern. if these patterns are found in the text, the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can select this name arbitrarily, it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Erase. the list is processed in the order from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separately by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID of running programs will be provided with the qdbus program; you have to omit the & dbus; numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID will copy-3432, you may only enter copies.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replacement filter is applied to the text only if all the conditions apply with an entry in the Diesen Filter box if they match. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the annotation filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\. so the words must be limited by separators (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual, you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions. but if you have the & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; expressions have been installed, you can call it in the dialogues add or edit as help for setting these expressions.</seg>

<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc is reachable via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the subscriber selection filter, you can send text to a specific speaker, which is set up on the card speaker, or to a speaker with certain characteristics. you can, for example, specify that text should be read by a female voice.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional filters (SDB filters).

<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetwork.org; network hardware cannot be installed. physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured in a functional way, so that & knetwork.com. The device is even indicating and setting the network properties possible.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing & Linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded when the Network Setting option is selected in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index. when the module network settings are started, this module attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be identified, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which best matches the distribution and the relaasestand. by selecting the setting non-re-issues, the definition can be made permanently. the next start of the network settings will then automatically preset this selection.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in the system management mode. previously, all options are displayed gray, meaning the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in the system management mode, click the button of the system management mode at the lower end of the module. it is required to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">The entire functionality of the module is available in the system management mode. it is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be carried out by the tab's network interfaces:</seg>

<seg id="2820">A host with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine requests http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will resolve this name into an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution machine part of the name resolution allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS records can be sorted in the priority list by selecting an entry and drop down or downgrading in the list of buttons.</seg>

<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is sufficient if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the precompiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a & console; install with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetwork.com. The following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, in the second section all of the & knetwork.com. changeable configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section does not replace any further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC can be conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently using TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found a wide distribution. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. therefore, this description is currently focusing on the common IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned. in foreign networks, at & eg; Workstation, the network administrator is the contact point to use a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up an own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a range reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, so any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, mostly addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = the own machine). the default route is required for IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The net address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed loop.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files specified by & knetwork.com. and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed with DSL connections so it won't be surprised if there's another content found there in case of active DSL connections.</seg>

<seg id="2889">It appears the default node; -Print dialog. if you select unfolds, you will see that there are two additional & kcron; -specific options in the print dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Print the crontab of all users on the system. this option is only accessible to users who own advanced permissions.</seg>
<seg id="2891">Cron, for example, vixie cron. & kcron; uses the command crontab to modify the schedules of the user.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar that offered the ability of dds2tar for quick, selective packing. the second purpose was to answer a question my wife asked: how much longer does it take to secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used it must be mounted by & kdat; it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; retrains the tape and reads the pre-tensioning information of the tape. detects and dat; the pre-credits on the tape do not, you will be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognises & kdat; the pre-credits, it searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index is to be created anew.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything goes smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive is changed to indicate that the tape is mounted. in the Status bar a corresponding message appears. the volume of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; there is a change in the symbol for the tape to detect that the connection for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat; it must be formatted by & kdat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can use it to save data. this process does not conform to formatting with & kdat; this process does not conform to formatting, before you can format a tape before being used. floppy-tape drives usually require formatting of the tape, while DAT drives do not require formatting.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity, the tape continues, with the format of the tape. all data on the tape are lost. after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically mounted and ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured, which can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a security profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the Save dialog opens. in this dialog, you can again check the selected files and change the backup settings.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "when you have confirmed the settings, the" "" "Backup" "" "dialog appears. the dialog displays the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the time remaining." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click in one of the archives and select the menu entry...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the scan process has been started, the dialog appears for review. in this dialog, you can review your selection again and change the working folder for the review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the review, the dialog appears. this dialog displays the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, you need to mark the files that are to be recovered. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Recover from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the Restore dialog will appear. in this dialog, you can review your selection again and change the restore folder for restoration.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the restore settings, the Restore dialog will appear. this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recreate the band index file by means of the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a security profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, it is true that only the files located in it are backed up on the same filesystem as the folder. folders that are on other file systems can be registered separately under backup files. each entry will be considered by tar independently of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; lt; files were not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up via the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding variant of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & dat; before the tape is mounted, the command mt load to the drive. for some drives, this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; block the ejection at the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work for all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, the tape will automatically be kicked off when releasing & kdat; the tape will automatically be kicked off. do not use this option on floppy disks.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is on, try & kdat; change the hardware-based block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you need & kdat; in any case the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">When & kdat; a tape formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The format of this string is the hostname: seconds, where the hostname is the complete name of the system on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the epoch in which the tape has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which let themselves be administrated directly with the GNU; - tar. even other tar -versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a tape. this icon is only active when a tape is mounted.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for unexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files. in addition, & ksystemlogs provides quick access to information about problems encountered on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlogs; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlogs; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your system. the program is suitable for unexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlogs; experienced users allow quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlogs; therefore try to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The current version 0.4.1 contains & ksystemlogs; a number of useful functions. this includes among others:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the screenshot below, & ksystemlogs; functions are available, with which the single protocol lines of a log file can easily be filtered and sorted. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After launching, & ksystemlogs; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will not be shown to you, and it will open instead of having a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely you will not have permission to read under Linux in the / var / log folder where normal users usually have no permissions to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or after entered strings. add a string to the filter bar. the list of the log lines will now be automatically displayed, so that only log lines will be displayed next to the filter. then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can of course also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the protocol file system protocol, select the column process, and also enter the name of a process in the filter bar, so show you & ksystemlogs; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color as protocol lines of level indicator. the color display of protocol lines can be switched off setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain processes (for example in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">You can also activate the Add to New Lines option in the main window context menu to display all new log-lines added.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlogs; allows you to display multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a report from the menu to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlogs; has a website dedicated to http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find more up-to-date information about the sources of & ksystemlogs.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlogs; in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion-archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; -archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init is rapidly becoming the standard for the control of the program start when booting the system in the Linux world. and this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without installing a new installation and reformatting. Linux; the kernel first looks under / etc after an init file. that's why you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service you want to start when you boot up the system or when you switch to another running level. system services do not include such things as setserial, which is started only once. such calls go to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be located in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something with the serial port when booting.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init at different places after the program and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default running level is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see in the initial area a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Runlevel 3 is 3. if you want to change this, you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have confused something, then you can repair it by restarting the system and doing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is a shortcut to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop. you can actually run these scripts manually on the command line like this:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script will be called with the stop stop. if it contains an S, the script will be invoked with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server running level that only runs httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user running level, that & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program has been created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six running levels to start (or stop) at this level.</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between level levels or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. this is done only if they extract an entry from the area of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be moved if you drag them to a new range. in order to simply copy them to a new Runlevel, you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry previously existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the trash bin. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the various workspaces (available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another Runlevel, move it to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired Runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes, or press Esc to reject the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard Runtime leveln, and now the machine boots up constantly. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter linux single on the LILO prompt and press the input key to start in the single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default running level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for executing under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services in these distributions are started simplifies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check that all configuration files are available that are required by the system service (and whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) can be quit easily if their configuration files are not available or misconfigured.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even vary from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that they can be attached to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; to begin, it is sufficient to read the customization of & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you must save it. either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the Save In menu item.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, the user and the user groups list. for editing, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it appears the User - or Group Characteristics dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings. only if you have limited space constraints (quota) for users, a card card is created where you can set individual settings. additional card cards appear, if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card password management will appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if there is a limited file system (quota) enabled and initialized (recognizable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user, with the limitation of space constraints in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current file system is selected using the field file system with space limitation</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card card groups inform about the group affiliations of the selected user. the standard group, which the user belongs to, can be found in the Primary group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Group's Properties dialog contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select that user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user respectively the selected group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the boot manager, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot of the default operating system, add the default operating system, remove, change operating systems, remove, change and more.</seg>
