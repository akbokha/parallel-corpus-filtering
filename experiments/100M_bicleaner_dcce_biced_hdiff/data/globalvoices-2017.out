although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and run his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can L@@ etter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil mag@@ n@@ ate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges , who were inclined to his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if it was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only intensified .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose variety is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very fan@@ ati@@ cal love letter about his great@@ ness .
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he per@@ ishes with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never thinks about the mountain behind the mountain , as one says so beautifully .
he tells exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and Women .
nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted in favour of him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can pres@@ election was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I could not reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the Journ@@ alism Program , which includes people from all over the world , a deeply beli@@ ever man with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s world@@ view coinci@@ ded with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix S@@ uns playing .
Tr@@ um@@ ps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who struggles the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits to Krist@@ i &apos;s commitment , which always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleague to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Le@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wis@@ er advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump broke his way to the nom@@ in@@ ee Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
it turned out however that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , were pres@@ idents of a man , despite - or perhaps precisely because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the debate with the idea that people voted for dump@@ ing because they either shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters as ra@@ cists .
ordering people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful , and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that those elec@@ tors , most of whom know , have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps . maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comm@@ enting on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different from him .
this &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( C@@ WC . ) : as much as white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities , &quot; white and whi@@ plas@@ h word play , as the great Van Jones described it , has killed exactly what America has made so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background you may always have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country , as its president , chose the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an twice , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
however , with the election Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , there is a huge part of the White Americas on this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the helm , they say .
all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices grew lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would someone who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son fell , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the news .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America .
and it breaks my heart .

out of misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; from C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero commune in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura in common ?
the fact that the music played in both places has changed not only the life of the children , but also a very close link with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill site , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca and # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town that is very popular with tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome poverty .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero &apos;s community in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its abuse of drugs and ban@@ anas .
but this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and gave the youth a rare hope for hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing and with shining eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn day after day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga to play .
music from garbage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled material :
music with re@@ processed instruments made from local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez .
the instruments im@@ itate violin , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all of which were made out of the rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire encompasses classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article from the Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , rec@@ alls the early days :
at first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in garbage . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something that he had never seen before : a violin made of waste .
today , there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of re@@ processed material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
every year , the world generates about one billion tons of garbage .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring performance of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played its music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully tackle illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the joint use of content .
back then in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia &apos;s waters before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were correspon@@ dingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this type on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles were quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the prime minister was surrounded by countries you simply refused to do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u rec@@ alls , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not possible for him to catch fish there .
ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to pil@@ lage of the fish stocks of the country .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 was founded by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the premi@@ er out of their waters back then .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries who are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and support each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , so it is extremely difficult to track down . thus illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
by intentionally ignor@@ ing existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , IU@@ U fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were formerly ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also by the sn@@ ail pace , with the information between individual countries , the actions happen nowadays in real time , trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships even if they move on the open seas , using satellite data .
this allows the authorities to flag ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , suspi@@ cious cycling routes can be discovered - such as those suggest@@ ing that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the involved ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal law .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports on the basis of this information . which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pun@@ ish@@ ments , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there are considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supporting F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue , which lost the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year because of illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade east African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
their practices include activities such as sailing under false flag , fake licence papers , phan@@ ta@@ sies , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non @-@ un@@ interrupted control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You must not run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yet another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the closed front has been working so far .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious ships .
it revealed criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several dec@@ eit@@ ful identi@@ ties and it has persecuted and found fle@@ eting ships .
due to his co @-@ operation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for the fight against crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track down the illegal ships that like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fisher@@ y data and provides technical support to F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , switch off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
therefore , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that combines different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ ISH @-@ i find criminal @-@ acting ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth launched the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization , Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data and , by means of which the position of each trac@@ eable vessel can be displayed worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of who is doing , it simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to pool their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only detect criminals but also sc@@ are them off .
ships that previously had been fishing without a license and hardly had any consequences , now know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i are now seeing a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries turnover since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors aboard tow@@ ing nets where prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that other countries now also copy us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , six countries joined the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; With certainty , the aim is to make even more of such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the way under false flag . and not only was the ship on the way without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets , which are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative approach to the protection of the oceans actually works across the world ocean . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TE@@ D Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; reg@@ aining the land &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are deemed to be a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after rej@@ ecting Venezuela &apos;s proposal for a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the country &apos;s political and economic crisis , ran into the void by gathering in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( e.g. the refund of Venezuela ) pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions of Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central @-@ north @-@ located Bundestag Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country continues to deteri@@ or@@ ate , which is reflected in the everyday life of the Veneti@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the removal of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro ; ultimately , the attitude of a re @-@ election was blocked by official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , Co @-@ Con@@ tri@@ but@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation and violence rates are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which there is a serious and far @-@ reaching deficiency in food and medicine , the referendum on im@@ pe@@ achment was the only way to give the country the chance to rec@@ ap@@ ture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly on 27 October . in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike on the Fol@@ get@@ ag and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an Government , should continue to exist .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nationwide Civil War and on 3 November all went to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .
keep on saying ! pic@@ .t@@ wit@@ ter@@ .com / 9@@ Zy@@ V@@ G@@ ld@@ N@@ ry

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the Action Programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures of the mar@@ ches that are published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen as well as supporters of the government .
one of the most frequently shared pictures shows a prot@@ esters calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Veneti@@ ans scre@@ amed . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , images that tell of disputes as well as reports of oppression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
especially big waves struck the news about police repression in the central @-@ north @-@ located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to their own testimony .
hours later they could leave the cathedral again safely , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ staat ( T@@ á@@ chir@@ a ) :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a don &apos;t wear a skir@@ ts , because otherwise one could see something that many National Guard did not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic is already doing the round that depic@@ ts the level of oppression per day :
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the call for a ten@@ ure proceedings - it was now proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the street .
my@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s about it :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado declare that 1 % of signatures are fake .
here is your removal !
on the road !
others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that , from their point of view , did little against the devastating economic crisis and rather engaged in con@@ gest@@ ing critical voices :
they took us so much - but also fear !
mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike rather than working or shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview given by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news site .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take a look at the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of Cor@@ doba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now told his father in the large La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cór@@ doba .
in the trial ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
he kept family secrets for 34 years .
in the situation at that time , I believed that this was all right .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child of 15 years , one doesn &apos;t notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turer and mur@@ derer .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a police officer . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the intelligence division 141 at La Per@@ la prison from 1976 to 1978 .

records of the archive .
this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation for himself .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you &apos;re an as@@ sh@@ ole , you &apos;ve been friends with one of the ERP .
just ins@@ ist that they don &apos;t kidn@@ ap you one day and I have to save you .

therefore he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he told me I would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secret &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had educated me .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all sorts of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda materials , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ Over there the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
the first and last time he was waiting for me at the entrance of the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - simply everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it I saw that there was a large l@@ ump of silver inside .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were stopped and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured there .
I saw in and saw a couch that men were tor@@ tured .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later on I found out that they fortified the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person lying there .
they tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , cast him over with water and drove him a load of 220 volts to the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was app@@ alling ... like a fil@@ thy no@@ od@@ le .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and it became clear to me that this is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible for a person to do so much harm to another ?
&apos;@@ i knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and wore eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chu@@ bo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background , I saw a series of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay down with the face - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance people quiet on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you look like as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told about it at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms known as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man there and killed a man there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survivors , the Zi@@ vi@@ list Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process , was accused of death by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , passes through the former torture chambers .
the way you came here is also the way in which the kidn@@ apped came here .
if you look at the map , you will see that they took about this road and were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ising .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order came from above that they should be laid .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war yield &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things home .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; spo@@ ils of war &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later on the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military rab@@ bits that one takes away from an enemy that is fought .

but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ table , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you who cho@@ ke cars on the streets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , beat me , scre@@ amed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you go so far , I will find you and kill you with your hands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we don &apos;t need anybody else to do that !
so my father was .
I have not a single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a tur@@ t@@ len@@ eck jum@@ per of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we weren &apos;t poor , but he still brought clothes to home .
at that time the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay me on the burden of what they wanted .
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you realize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have executed people during the dictatorship , but why do the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why children kidn@@ ap children ?
one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have been put in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why their bodies disappear ?
did these people not also have families to hand over their mortal remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re @-@ established , they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course something always remains .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie myself .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the idea of showing my father was born during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I was repro@@ ached for all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly ki@@ cked off and asked me why all the exagger@@ ated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; they supposedly defended were actually good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you say something to me ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I received the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can reproach me that I have been bi@@ ased . I have finally said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes , including serious , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by subsequent death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age .

judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the sentence in the Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life imprisonment in 28 cases and sentenced in nine cases to prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years .
eleven of the original 54 def@@ end@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Perm Jud@@ gment : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all def@@ end@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police members and civilian staff .
Pi@@ ero De Monti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Sil@@ esian Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , lawyer of H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who was founded in 1995 , represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research was carried out for 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the land on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial site could be built , which is now led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; translation error makes older people in Kyoto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto , where you can pro@@ long your driving licence .
the photo was spread in the social media .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long their driving licence , witnessed a very special mis@@ fortune in the last month .
in a sign the Japanese word was used for the Japanese word &quot; ( kor@@ ei@@ sha ) , which means &quot; older drivers &quot; wrong@@ ly - but perhaps also with a malicious interior thought &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; it was translated as &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ ori@@ sts . &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also who drew attention to the local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which appears in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; how could there be such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t for older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the defective English translation was initially removed . the term &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was replaced later by the more appropriate , though gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture did not ap@@ ologi@@ ze for translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported the ap@@ ologies as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sorry that older people felt insul@@ ted by the inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt with the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of elderly drivers , who are involved nationwide in accidents , is quite a cause for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens created 1.@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
as a result , their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors rose during the same period .
the author named above did comment on the light in the version of the article published on Yahoo , showing what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to have against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo on the translation error has , among other things , the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How defective is the translation not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language .
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue , who could translate the translation into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of translation , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees , can still make translations internally . then the Japanese employee , whose English skills are valued as the best , is made to be a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also common - often with funny results .
the confused and mysterious phrases that arise through mechanical translations show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English phrases in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints that often ad@@ orn T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable , or at least harmless as jewellery , but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more accurate translations .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures to take place on the internet and television
main site of the &quot; Nav@@ ajo con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; portal ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they wouldn &apos;t have access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later on other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible .
other online transm@@ it@@ ters also transp@@ os@@ ed recordings of the protest in Car@@ ac@@ as , which were organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups that oppose the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and writer at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was scar@@ ce and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# C@@ ens@@ orship : enable your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again closed .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been rel@@ uc@@ tant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as an &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is astonishing that this is still cheaper than buying two liters of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO called VE@@ sin@@ k@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two additional online transm@@ it@@ ters . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technology through which the DNS servers answer requests for specific domains .
if a web page is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds correctly or refuses to request the request when calling out such a website .
we confirm a DNS block : @ el@@ capit@@ ol , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transmission was dis@@ continued on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who performed the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested .
Flor@@ es was beaten as he was in police custody .
he was released eight hours later , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible through YouTube , it was reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections : this makes it more difficult for Venezu@@ el@@ ans to gain access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , T@@ ina struggles for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , who have been victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report from the architectural , published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation from university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one who has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta , in Paraguay there are more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over her head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children will have to do countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be canc@@ eled .
this practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a couple of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls affected by the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s practice - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which is in@@ oc@@ ulated to the Cri@@ adi@@ ta in general guarantees silence .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , whose daughter is in the belief that she will complete her training , improve her position in society and &quot; make something out of herself , &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family , whom the girl receives with him and justi@@ fies his exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance , who would otherwise have no education and might even be star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will experience it many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the phenomenon hitherto relatively unknown , which takes place in the hiding place in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , has a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent beats . she died shortly afterwards .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military hospital Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra went on a stick to Mar@@ ín until she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela accounted for the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s deep @-@ rooted practice for the death of the girl .
they called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and called for &quot; no further Carolina &quot; to be available in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely spread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered than children , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without papers , it is much easier to inf@@ ringe the rights of children without imp@@ unity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be trend @-@ setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , in which her father worked , had to use bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his job .
their brothers now had to work and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only T@@ ina was sent as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of their employers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours a day .
she had to divide the time in such a way that she would still have time to learn .
she got up at about five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared the breakfast for her employers .
Friday , for example , cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time for learning .
the sooner she finished learning , the more free she had .
but also this time was limited because it had to make supp@@ er for their employers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but she didn &apos;t have unlimited food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the house library as food from the fridge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she rec@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which belonged to the Opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings , the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and read leading positions in opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them not to believe in the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he considered it intelligent , but did not stop with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the master of the house had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would again learn &quot; bad habits &quot; again . this meant that Al@@ var@@ nar@@ a , belonging to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would return home to her mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ í .
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible .
but she knew perfectly that she had paid for everything she got from them , with their hard work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing almost never talked about is bul@@ lying and the har@@ ass@@ ment that Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed to when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to come home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .

society appro@@ ves the cri@@ p@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where job advertisements for cleaning staff and pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric girls in Paraguay can be shared .
the coordinator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please contact us .
starting on Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the place Ñ@@ u@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman , who also came out of Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the authors once again switched on the display :
dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the business was completed .

bill as@@ signs Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently voted to draft legislation on &quot; regulating the use and benefits of social networks . &quot;
when adopted by Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would be set up that is tas@@ ked with granting citizens a permit to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with acceptance of the law , users would have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine .
the bill that consists of six paragra@@ phs and circul@@ ates in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent defines social media as any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video surveillance and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is en@@ forced , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose registration on users . unclear is also how they should identify those who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad@@ Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users who received a username and password from the Ministry of Communications to get through the fire@@ wall that Facebook blocks . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to that , it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to file information about their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist , the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &apos; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &apos; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I strongly believe in the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt related to things that have to do with technology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means that they will establish a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request a permit or not . and that means a mad system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to trial .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be passed as a law , the draft must first be discussed under Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and safegu@@ ar@@ ded that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y , MP , proposed a bill of legislation against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was provided for those found guilty to thre@@ aten &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest against protests . &quot;
how a Kurdish natural advoc@@ ate protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in Iraq drawn by war

high up in the mountains of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in the northeast of Iraq , the animal welfare campaig@@ ner H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the le@@ op@@ ards , who strike through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered because of wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat .
why is this particular le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; and the health and thri@@ ving of the ecosystem depends on the fact that a big pre@@ dat@@ or is present .
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard actually in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera bag , R@@ aza gets out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza loves to show a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , it has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to providing protection zones for wildlife in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for nor@@ theastern Japan , highlighted the progress made over the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a couple of pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had let entire coastal towns disappear from the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture has even experienced an atomic accident . 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local perspective which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents .
the newspaper &apos;s detailed report contains both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement buildings ( for example , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to see the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 per cent of the planned replacement buildings were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is the final light of 70 percent .
nevertheless , six years after the catastrophe , one still tries to res@@ ett@@ le the ev@@ ac@@ uation of temporary shel@@ ters ( for example , the kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ch@@ ak@@ u ) in definitive replacement buildings .
after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in temporary shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were still living in such homes .
almost 40 percent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma ev@@ ac@@ uation in 2011 still lives in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation homes , who were in temporary shel@@ ters after the disaster , were res@@ ett@@ led in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number here is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , industrial re@@ building in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are in operation again , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have grown extensively in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agriculture .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recovered 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the Nu@@ clear Sperr@@ gebiet .
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far away .
the number of tourists in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate is up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dw@@ ellers , it is more difficult to find their livel@@ ihood .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine the overall picture , the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation . she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how her indignation has changed against the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to find out more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents said that there was still not enough in the case of disasters prevention .
for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition to commemor@@ ate the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper upgraded their attention to the situation of the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma ev@@ ac@@ uation .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma not only had to experience the huge earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness of the worst , disa@@ strous , nuclear accident that Japan had to experience .
nearly 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture by 160@@ ,000 people ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
at the beginning of 2016 more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been res@@ ett@@ led into permanent replacement buildings .
after 2017 , there are still 40,000 residents of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres are older than 50 years old in temporary shel@@ ters . it is known to them that the efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma need to compete with massive construction projects . this is construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when one meets people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater at first than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often real@@ ises that it bin@@ ds more than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ ini explains how a migration has consolidated its affection to Iranian culture ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa rec@@ alls the lack of shared language skills during a journey in the rural China ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time he has gathered with people from around the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by police at national demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week . last Friday , a police officer had beaten him against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him on this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spreading rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás knew that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the investigation into the incident by the active ministry .
the pictures show the police officer how he hits the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his head@@ stock ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be visible for six months on TV and all the oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ol@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video taken from Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net , in which one sees Mat@@ eus attacked by the police officer and several param@@ e@@ dic@@ s shortly afterwards .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , has also appeared on social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in another state , Internet users have meanwhile donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while lying in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing has been shared several times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás is experiencing a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father , because he was involved in the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group had been sab@@ ot@@ aged by a gas leak , and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a police officer who has hit him with a head@@ stock .
police Hand@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which last Friday it was a brutal police action against demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
police officers took protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for or@@ ators , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeakers .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media has sw@@ apped street protests by directing the focus to another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de São Paulo specifically reported a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively design their titles with a photo .
O Glob@@ o , on the other hand , preferred a cover story with a bus set in fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than over the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of material damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; ob@@ tains an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical acts of violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on the course of confrontation with the police . &quot;
the Un@@ char@@ ted Vill@@ ages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso &apos;s law , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular commune of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the Western Cu@@ ban province of May@@ ab@@ e@@ que , is widely known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site .
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
after the fall , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants until only the framework of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ign and commu@@ te daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who is rising every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry doesn &apos;t ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time are back in operation because they were preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene rec@@ alls that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty .
why was the Cu@@ ban sugar cane industry powered off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality has already seen better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated and hardly competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production goal was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.0@@ 3 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ uries per pound , according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FA@@ O , the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cu@@ ban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring started in the sugar industry .
the following years saw the closure of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents said the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to receive , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first Jubilee year , the first letters began to come .
it was a matter of officially written documents , which differ@@ ed only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was taken over and the letters became more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , wa@@ its for retirement in another complex , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in which he helped to build .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work truck was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , no alternatives were created for the work places and services that the plants were generating in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know if during the M@@ amm@@ ut speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then President saw in the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only highly by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the people of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to picture it , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without prospects for the future , many young people suddenly left the region .
in the area , a food factory was created whose production serves not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the site where he began working .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ eso per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a tra@@ iling person , yet he does not forgive the lies that one told him .
they have tor@@ mented him for ten years .
N@@ ene works in retirement at the age of 65 , not because he lacks strength , but because he is em@@ bit@@ tered .

first Nations young people use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and get their own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission from N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
youth of the first Nations communities across Canada are concerned with topics that are important to them . they do this via hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by the educ@@ ator David H@@ od@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and worked with ten Cre@@ e communities in Montreal and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop goes up with the fact that the young participants learn topics like &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are the inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the strain of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the State of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ eb First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a street section in Western Canada , where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were mostly not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation is using the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs in spite of the influences of global@@ isation is .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people were not always able to speak the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ script as well as a translation into English translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day when you will take our cry
because as a youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise some@@ day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this way they can grow and move forward as well as our youth
so they can do what they intended for the Creator
in the comment section , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contributes and adds the St@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ en@@ script ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( for as many as typical ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see in front of almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ lo@@ u ( the &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) are displayed by any dish served in this restaurant .
customers will see these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a number of small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend turns them into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets today .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ lo@@ u .
now in special sale : new mobile tapes decorated with plastic gri@@ lles , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial food were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collective objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food supplies is becoming increasingly more complex .
in this case , an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a cell phone stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station .
and here &apos;s an apple that holds your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design .
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some Handy @-@ St@@ ands and Handy @-@ designers will allow you to make your own artwork . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with salmon &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , so as to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile stand has the shape of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon .
other whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal plastic dishes can be found at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # of the blog ? or ? ? ? ? ? ? .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed periodic@@ ally appear only in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings .
the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Ch@@ apo Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely over@@ threw the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind each cor@@ p@@ se , behind every bust find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , which is to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were involved in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project like this :
organised crime not only makes us afraid of our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the P@@ ain of Vic@@ tims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear lives change &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews , on a single day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ ests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday , we are preparing again today for the task we have made , to go and to look for tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is the name of Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th , he should be back , but he never came back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is with me too .
at the moment it has no income .
you have the insurance of my father , but she does not pay her out , because they demand a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to show not only the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and governance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have been familiar with disease and sensational journ@@ alism for several years now .
every day I pass the newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures , which can actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from experts of specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as though I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ cker ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
the in@@ action of the people is unbelievable for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were &quot; wat@@ ered . &quot;
I think they try to convince themselves that they remain spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies when they are not ag@@ itated and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the Capital District : how a family was lo@@ oted with threats . &quot; this describes how armed criminals pressed money from their business month for month , until they end not only destroying the business but also tore their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days .
the pain never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we will only contact you if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap you or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days whether crying would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Kids of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man killed by organised crime ?
what is it like to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells us he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , make potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the vial with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years earlier , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody body of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez was as follows :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as violence by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez was missing .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council of Public Security and Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor named 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to 8.5 murder per day .
these are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
few stories continue to live in the face of ever new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this article and the pages to which it links contain pictures depicting violence .
the fact @-@ check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the year after something the first time has emerged ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its initial release , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false linking of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tank truck tra@@ vers@@ ed the town of S@@ ange in the eastern part of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded , and 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected and devast@@ ated for years . the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank truck fell victim to it .
official representatives described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses , including a cinema close by , full of people who watched football world champi@@ onships .
houses plast@@ ered and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das ist Nigeria &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident depic@@ t the horrible scenes of that day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example .
it shows rows of carb@@ oni@@ zed bodies that are lined up on the ground while individuals watch it .
but here the story doesn &apos;t end .
over the years , the same photograph was taken several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , and mis@@ understand@@ ably attributed to related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses have dramatically reported atro@@ cities they had to flee from .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
the follow @-@ up time could only be depicted with satellite images .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ explained , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of the B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo as it was wrong@@ ly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is just one in a series of false attri@@ butions ; Africa Check has documented commitments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a receipt for mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments such as this example wrong@@ ly counter@@ act the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning report published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee were beaten , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts showed up like the following , who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site , which in 2012 claimed to be the president of Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ an being said that monks and politicians were involved in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to report this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations called AF@@ P as their source also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ an being this statement , but did not have the image of the DR Congo related to it .
the worldwide coverage of false information
traces of these false dec@@ eption ranges back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can go beyond borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) , which are very similar to the mentioned image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixture of private pages , social media platforms and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages , such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have re@@ directed false reports , some have attempted to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have bor@@ rowed examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked it to the respective countries , based on what side they were published , so we want to show the scope more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases are also inter@@ connected ) , several examples may be used for ab@@ u@@ sive use .
here are some cases that can now be completely tra@@ cked ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fra@@ mes .
examples of wrong coupl@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers , which are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .
the countries in Gra@@ y are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are likely to also demonstrate for@@ gery examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread on the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this paper , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City does not only mention the false report , but also disc@@ usses the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the persons and the trage@@ dies involved ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los cris@@ ti@@ anos &quot; ( In Nigeria , they burn the Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in North Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place .
La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca quotes as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although it is not known whether the original report has the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ sessions after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am as this one here , which used the image of the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; have clearly seen no sites such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who dispro@@ ve this .

even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo was shared as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , with a tweet that expresses sympathy with the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand a blo@@ gger &apos;s attempt to del@@ egi@@ timi@@ ze the claims , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government has published a definition of what it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intentionally dark news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings about Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this adjustment , which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that are used by H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and are used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; fal@@ si@@ fication of a happening &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) .
this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DRC does NOT show Muslims that Christians kill .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ an had admitted being in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture will continue to contain it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on Stu@@ dents , who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , released from the news page An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , which has now been deleted , has expressly declared that the image does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it depic@@ ts a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later circul@@ ated in connection with the 2015 B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there would be connections to Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ th@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image of the DR Congo came up with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag and spark@@ ed a discussion among Muslims after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events that allegedly took place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the image was t@@ wit@@ ched as evidence for the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ ar@@ ded ) , but the messages related to it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Indonesian ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this one here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false message .
from the embassy in which the image from the DR Congo was included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ tin Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves .
there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the map in grey ) also indicate Tin@@ Eye , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries associated with URLs and time / date stamp exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally have image file names relating to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original item of 2010 , the picture may ultimately have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong subjects or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that pull these posts through . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the mur@@ ders of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is important . therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are tens of people who intentionally have a share of drinking water around a tragedy .
does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and ad@@ orn the actual horror of what has actually happened in DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in great detail ( see here for example ) .
one argument is that the with@@ holding of images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy is to be recognized . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images of readers and viewers are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing and taking the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media are acting on helping others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss with violent represent@@ ations in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons uses CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. conf@@ using ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or impossible to translate at all .
such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( such as the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish Sob@@ rem@@ esa ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
one word or expression does not suff@@ ice , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a bit of context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird chose to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find , for example , words from the Ta@@ p cla@@ p language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - be proud of your parents in recognition of how they have been working for you in your younger years .
and words in the Hun@@ s@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the comfort or sl@@ oth that one feels after being war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they un@@ veil other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site want to publish even more of these &quot; conf@@ using &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Languages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are highly valued by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ olo O@@ ya entered the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to a statement from the Sri L@@ ank@@ an disaster of May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people were killed because of the floods and mud winds .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people have been transported to 304 secure residen@@ ces .
the rainf@@ alls continued on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
health and hygiene conditions of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the floo@@ ding catastrophe :
floo@@ d@@ water in Ta@@ j@@ ama City with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates for the high water situation .
many people use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s le@@ thal floods are wor@@ sen the den@@ sit@@ ory crisis , warns Save the Children , after further ra@@ ins are already on their way .
today the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle was also floo@@ ded because of the water level of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and further five are being completed to transport emergency supplies for the residents enclosed in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ hal@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 today if you need help in this area .
the Taxi Call @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks for people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ en@@ entrum will be informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me launched a &quot; flood relief &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle to collect assistance and donations . these were then handed over to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross free of charge .
they also launched a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped in floods and land@@ slides .
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in distress and help .
this has prevented the loss of further lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
use authorized t.@@ At the beginning of January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love girlfriend .
I trust in her my four years old daughter , she confi@@ deth in me her children : she is my rock in the surf .
in the one minute , we still call slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next step , we will have rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are located in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , tied from an American flag , others cann@@ ed par@@ ses against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things don &apos;t concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already guided this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their conception .
they had to mobili@@ se me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look alike .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify to be a Muslim in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who do not fit in there , will be reli@@ eved .
to be reli@@ eved
I &apos;m not alone .
this even happened to the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you have in mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am , he was a Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Qur &apos;@@ an and the Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry right up to the day he died .
but in the western idea , the Rum@@ is religion was extingu@@ ished , as well as the most popular translations of its poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another consists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims that have coloni@@ zed Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid disman@@ tled the story behind these images .
but these pictures still stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ er them .
I worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , flaw@@ ed narr@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that led nine Muslim women to their countries during the last three decades , while the USA could not even elect their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and forced Saudi , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , which these are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group ex@@ erts its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here by slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has so deeply and flaw@@ ed our collective imagination that often Si@@ kh &apos;s men and children are becoming the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion include
in the news industry we are more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create sc@@ ars that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the figure of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims represent the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population is African @-@ Muslim Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ atic League of Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan had re @-@ imagined the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were the ad@@ versaries of Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a sore Muslim and an American ?
sometimes , when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of extrac@@ ting my Muslim recipes or hand@@ ing away my handy pocket @-@ bag , which all Muslims carry - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ p@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ ok@@ er , we don &apos;t carry all our hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be chosen for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread fal@@ seh@@ oods about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well lubric@@ ated Islam@@ opho@@ di@@ ality machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for false information , which have manipul@@ ated our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell her , there is Islam@@ opho@@ bia in more than just a stranger who tears a woman &apos;s head@@ sc@@ arf .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as Muslims , but to be a Muslim was born only then in my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they resort to the following terms : belief , behaviour and belonging .
my Muslim beliefs and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my friend , my neighbor , would see my neighbour , my rock in the surf , that I am Muslims if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our homes .
she would see the ni@@ gh@@ tly ritual with my daughter if I kept her in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arab Ver@@ se to protect her who seal the Qur &apos;@@ an and call the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim nationality is always part of my shadow .

belonging is the image of my grand@@ mother &apos;s mother@@ ly part with her sisters ; as they decades ago they win a competition of the art of flower arrangements in Kar@@ achi .
it is the picture of her that at this moment I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and incomplete paintings painted Su@@ fi Hol@@ liger ; and a Qur &apos;@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers they told me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is how they taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who - for centuries - was coloni@@ zed by an &quot; empire , &quot; founded by a company called Hon@@ orable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , has a deep meaning to mention God , my only Lord .
the author of 1987 with her grandfather .
approved use .
belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather is crying .
in the meantime , while writing books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ a , N@@ ana J@@ aan wept for his family in India ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , family whom he was not allowed to close in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , like my grandfather , have been torn apart by coloni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at play .
to be Muslims means knowing that in the last two centuries , Europeans have &quot; coloni@@ zed &quot; all to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first pilot bomb of history was thrown off a Muslim country a century ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mere subj@@ ection of the British empire , was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dangerous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even before there were planes , he traveled to more parts of the world than I was ever and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means to remember that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed over every continent apart from the Antar@@ c@@ tica , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried beneath the ruins of the war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among the veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy eng@@ ages the US and the susp@@ ects we@@ ars a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave named Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when humans filled the airports to fight the Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life count .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ist , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple con@@ junc@@ tions , but to fail to communicate them to others .
the narrative of 1.7 billion contains more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ er , but is represented in the reducing branch &quot; we &quot; against &quot; them . &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia lies in Muslim registr@@ ars , which began with President Bush and wi@@ dened by President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that closes its borders to people from just the countries it bom@@ bed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly @-@ List &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is mostly targeted by Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the wars we lead and the bombs we have on Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scholars from the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically un@@ real image and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back decades to recognise the roots of our fears , and the flaw@@ ed and dangerous prints that we have in our news editorial departments .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims in the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ will of Muslims ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to print more Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American Super@@ hero - all this gives me hope .

col@@ lage by the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences going beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ ori@@ sts who existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years earlier , they had not yet given them ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who today made me an un@@ bound Muslim .
things I have left here like a bread@@ cr@@ umb track in my speech .
things that may awaken memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made to another .
right now , on the other side of the Berkeley Bridge , Con@@ vers@@ ations take place at the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually disc@@ ard in our schools or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people are being dramati@@ zed by creating the &quot; other &quot; in the public performance , four decades ago he himself was a scientist of Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being consciously and un@@ consciously the &quot; other . &quot; just as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake , while he already en@@ capsul@@ ated countries and &quot; to other made &quot; people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for Nar@@ r@@ ative Art aims to preserve urban language diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices recently reported on another initiative by Steven Bird , the un@@ man@@ a@@ geable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS lies not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of big cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
the following applies to the feasibility of the project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces in which people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to this often involves understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to cher@@ ish , to feel , to start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers present their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers , their devotion and presentation lead to the fact that the audience enters it .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions , as the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional history from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ ug@@ ara tells the f@@ ables of the rab@@ bit and the Bab@@ oon in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his parable , John Ny@@ am@@ us asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how about speaking to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a broad smile he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
they listened to them !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
the events of Treas@@ ure Language stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities so far , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ y@@ telling .
Puerto Rico calls for re@@ establishment of public debt by the United States
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 ; the March started at the Mexican Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went down to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ vic front for the re @-@ examination of the debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the advoc@@ ates for the re@@ establishment of the debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico call for politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts to be held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding to remuneration that acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers won &apos;t be able to reconci@@ le themselves with sin@@ king pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not in the United States &apos;s United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervisory authority .
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos necess@@ it@@ ates a large restructuring of the state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
measures imposed from the outside are threatened without the participation and conviction of the citizens to be rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration bore the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night Vi@@ gi@@ l for Light and Truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ m , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and remind the contributions he has made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on digital culture , which is held in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass @-@ campaign was dedicated .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) .
the book published last year and is freely available here includes a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it &apos;s a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book wants to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ m , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been det@@ ained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was deleted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , where he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or place of residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book entitled &quot; Coll@@ ective Mem@@ ories &quot; gives his friends and his family a voice that calls for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has made many of us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of partly extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown location from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that on 12 November 2015 she was contacted by people who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them about an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes was more for@@ esi@@ ghted than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of many civili@@ zations and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria but the world .
this strip in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
of course , Bass@@ el was unable to complete this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life in dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el brought me English , even when he was in prison .
I have learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he has taught others to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he taught to other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a proof that she wrote to her husband in 2012 @-@ 2015 when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for one year .
she s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them into English from Arabic .
the book is available free of charge .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It Happ@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the reflection at the moment in which we embrace ,
that every one of the dangers does not matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the cr@@ ush of the prison
and I tune into every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes bid f@@ arewell
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to rec@@ laim all the moments ,
and to cry and smile about your absence .
I persu@@ ade myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of Bass@@ el &apos;s imprisonment , G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
a year goes by , my soul
while at the same time
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ le &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime in 2011 , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in custody since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices @-@ Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our call today in the hope that we must do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambique : Director of Cor@@ ruption caused by Cor@@ ruption once again on previous post
Moz@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case in which a member of the government returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and , together with four other def@@ end@@ ants , was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ end@@ ants .
the money came from public funds of the airports of Moz@@ ambique , whose council took over Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his re@@ appointment to the company , which happened on April 19th .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s Office of the Republic , who evaluated the motion , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post , as the company did not perform any disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many inhabitants do not expect the promotion to be good .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish its director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression regarding the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that even the company should have in@@ stituted a disciplinary procedure against the contrary .
the company apparently kept silent and did not cause any appropriate legal action for the application of the appropriate functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , an important voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ can social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; contrary &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to prison and half of whom had been served .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish up his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company which he helped to inflic@@ t damage .
consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
ref@@ using to resist !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director had no moral :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he offen@@ ded him I can &apos;t believe that you are rewarded in such a way that has already so mas@@ sively insul@@ ted the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lack@@ ed the morality to return to serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served solely on the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewar@@ ding .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mah@@ el , to remember that a th@@ ief is in jail :
thi@@ eves belong to Sam@@ ora Mah@@ el prison , not only to be remembered as the first independent president for ever , but also as a sharp , inter@@ sec@@ ting and - inci@@ dentally - proph@@ etic or@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of his most famous oral accounts was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest to sell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sam@@ or@@ ah also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he spent 10 years and was released .

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ itting b@@ asses .
photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Comm@@ ons , Creative Comm@@ ons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported
according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network adopted their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to point to people of East Indian origin or generally use as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or the &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; word as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating conn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with rac@@ ism today , but the word itself does not automatically provoke hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts where they discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for their use have been cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with different mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair on Bur@@ m@@ ese is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; kal@@ ar pairs &apos; ( sp@@ agh@@ etti ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ d@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ dy A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is of the opinion that she will l@@ essen hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook needs to be more analytical before del@@ eting all posts that were suspected of spreading rac@@ ism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it automatically filters the word .
the automati@@ sm won &apos;t understand what you write on Facebook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and control it by checking the related words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pairs &quot; ( spl@@ itting b@@ lower ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive quite a good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise her nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all who spread hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experience of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat proved that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to share his friends only that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new Facebook policy , I posted a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is blocked .
iron@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from reading , posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post &quot; didn &apos;t correspond to the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech removed from Facebook .
in the post , the author expressed his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems that they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ as cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wrong@@ ly deleted posts .
if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that did not contain any hate speech , but were still removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence , have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks is to fire violence in the communities of Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where conflict between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts has forced thousands to flee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to control the prolifer@@ ating hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese sides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better to focus more on context than on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago comes to the end with the to@@ e
a wedding ring in the sand .
photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 .
the to@@ e is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law to ban this practice , so that the age of marri@@ ages is now 18 .
before this change of the married couple , some members of Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities adher@@ ed to the practice , and in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ Be@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( I@@ RO ) , a group representing representatives of various religious groups in the country , said that the state should not interfere since that , age did not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Child Rights , the min@@ ors are defined as , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every person under the age of 18 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children born with 15 already was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the statistical central office of the country confirmed that from 1997 to 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements aimed at aboli@@ shing the laws of child@@ birth followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result .
nevertheless everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the to@@ e , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition was causing tensions in this un@@ complicated matter , and at some point there arose doubts whether the opposition would agree to the draft law at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the Chil@@ d@@ hood - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law .
one of the sen@@ ators of the country announced on Facebook a status update which has re @-@ posted Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the child marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and none of them voted against it .
after he was voted before in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of the social media users were thri@@ lled , because the laws on to@@ e had finally been changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who holds a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk , which disgu@@ ised the core of the matter , but know what ? to@@ e is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost any price .
while Abel was in the opinion , it was definitely long enough to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , Excell@@ ent News !
the married couple has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for that - 0 on the other hand ! ! ! ! &quot;
the Tor@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group , who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the age @-@ old age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation of 18 years .
the draft for the amend@@ ment to the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz was approved today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present in the vote .
all de@@ pu@@ ties who were opposed have voted for the law .
the law is no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # hed@@ geho@@ g tor@@ rent .
many thanks to all the activists who challenged him .
congratulations .
a Th@@ ank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible catch comes in the form of Sat Samuel Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization in the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take legal action , should the law be adopted , and he seems to initiate his promise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , argued that it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different .
Patricia Vor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so generally , in a way that we , instead of talking about the problem , would simply talk about that the state , our daughters from protecting that they might be mis@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in advantage to them , &quot; would you be prepared to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the inf@@ ancy in different levels is legal or still the norm , even though there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .

on Sunday , the Office of the Prosecutor announced the local news service Y@@ ar@@ news that they were h@@ ack@@ ed .
by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia contents
the Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A Copyright legislation in the USA , internationally dark@@ ened .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day by day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series fight against the block@@ age .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use b@@ yp@@ assing tools for blocked websites ( a recent article by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , most usual Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has blocked articles from Wikipedia , as recently described in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
to China , Turkey is the second most popular country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to be locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) when the platform disman@@ tled all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( computer calcul@@ ator links ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is available in spite of legal prohibition .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after listening to the news ( via the locking of Wikipedia ) , we all started to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents in a decentr@@ alized and distributed way .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia articles , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was performed independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it &apos;s just about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has issued both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mad site from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Le@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors if blocked in the respective country Wikipedia .

you access another URL that is not the original . that what you see is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server sends the request to the right Wikipedia page , making it possible to see the contents of Wikipedia , even if they are locked in Turkey .

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
a Su@@ h@@ len@@ ose Rhin@@ o , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around himself . they were blur@@ red with badly positioned motives and washed out colors .
this motiv@@ ates him to carry a camera and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown , right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helps him in his work :
I live on the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when I suddenly called Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river was a le@@ op@@ ard .
the dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to cra@@ ck@@ le pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to co @-@ operate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une Nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he was to know it , for he was already face to face with tig@@ ers :
a tiger is not disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ de@@ k appeared . he sat down immediately , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the sc@@ arf @-@ trees ! !
in order to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos .
his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ ters at Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist lod@@ g@@ ings .
take a look at some of these photos below .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India .
a revised version was again published as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid speaking with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , keep this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted by the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a and was exp@@ elled by her family and the village community after she had appe@@ aled to a married relative with a name .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer warran@@ ts to fear , if at all which , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ let in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health workers and house@@ wives , performed a unique club and were thus quickly become the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , it is part of the Camp@@ aig@@ n # K@@ hel@@ mini@@ al , which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campaig@@ ned for the exploitation of the patri@@ archy .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the aid of her video camera to expose practices such as childhood marriage to exile of HIV and AIDS infected , and leads these clubs .
she reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambass@@ adors for change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion was women who did not call their hus@@ bands a name .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the discussion about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
not to speak out the name of their hus@@ bands is a custom that they are all guilty and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is regarded as a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deep rooted that we have never thought about it until this round of discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , whom her husband had never named by the name , wanted to try at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
raw ini re@@ counts :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
then she all asked , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can tell us how they want it means that they don &apos;t respect us ?
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
raw ini re@@ counts :
a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she was only gi@@ g@@ gling in front of him ; another decided to release the whole pent @-@ up fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the adren@@ aline rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands at home .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put into the head of women : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member chose to do it at dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she got sc@@ ared and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation started in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zin@@ ced red dot on the forehead that shows the mar@@ ital status :
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would carry the zin@@ ced red point if he did it too .
he just laugh@@ ed and I stopped bearing it .
the other women have not ceased fully with it , but they think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last few months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their life ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never imagined before .
raw vegetables says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years now and yet I have never talked so hon@@ estly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties linked to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they seem to be .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honour and how it is related to clothes .
some women in the group have only borne sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of them it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ sa @-@ cur@@ d , a wide shirt over a pants ; they didn &apos;t dare .
after much discussion and discussion about the advantages of her own choice of dress , mor@@ als connected with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled her own couple of Kur@@ tas ( shirts ) into a discussion board so that the women could wear them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will be able to do it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion lu@@ b , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
so far we have only taken small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of her husband .
some of them , including me , still do it , but only when they are alone and there are no other family members .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red at all times on their forehead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the h@@ ag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult @-@ to @-@ navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini declares :
each of us is a sacrifice of the patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first visit to Japan for the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les during their landing in Japan .

on June 29th of this year the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turn@@ around in the Japanese culture of the post@@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , noticed in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just barely five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
it became clear to the people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .

even today songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English instruction at Japanese middle schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .

and as it is for fans , Japanese are naturally also making pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places connected with the band .

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia cau@@ tioned the people that bald men could be target of attacks in Moz@@ ambique .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald people for organ trading , probably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , is disturbing the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government has now called a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and some of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently conf@@ essed that the organs of Sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are being used .
there are local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a bald man could reveal gold or bring wealth , the police spokesperson on Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC declared .
it is the first time that successive attacks on men @-@ headed men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the goal of mur@@ ders for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this caused the UN 2016 to carry out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight against these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men , who travel to Moz@@ ambique to Moz@@ ambique , are the target of ritual attacks , warned the Moz@@ ambique police following the latest assass@@ ination of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ um Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the town of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police are already pursuing the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that there exists a faith , according to which the victims in the head might have power generating the riches .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared on Facebook the chron@@ ic@@ le of the B@@ log@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambique :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Moz@@ ambique , TH@@ AT I am ashamed of a country where people would be ashamed to offer sex against good marks , work and other achievements , a nation in which people would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country where neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or bald are hun@@ ted for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor could not be missed .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district Mor@@ ą@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ ange and the police spokesperson Z@@ á@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both gl@@ amor@@ ous :
Moz@@ ambique Auth@@ orities are very concerned about the kill@@ ings of bald people .

a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ m ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) played a key role in expanding public access to Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices @-@ Community and participated in our meeting of Arabic blo@@ ggers in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who were out@@ si@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband was sentenced to death but gave no further information .
Bas@@ le &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( August 1 , 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we are doing the honor of Bass@@ el &apos;s work as a pioneer in the open web movement .
and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organizations that have spent their release in the last five years .
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights organization .
countless of those arrested by the regime were subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in jail , the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

free Bass@@ el : N@@ eti@@ zen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New responses from the international community for medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the fall of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the terminal stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion , &quot; having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ u &apos;s case as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spokes@@ man told that he deemed it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China is still receiving calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to allow him or to allow him treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are fully wi@@ ped out of the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summari@@ zed some of the reactions abroad .
United Nations United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway , Norway , Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister , Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Minister of Foreign Affairs , B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende , refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to an end after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that ultimately it has nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed last December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon rolls to China , as exports have largely been blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately free Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ u , as she announced on 30 June :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also expect China to raise all the restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are supposed to meet and receive all the visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans &quot; wish him the possibility of treatment abroad insofar as he could help him with his recovery . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the AF@@ P news agency on June 27 that the Embassy told the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
the US Embassy &apos;s call came to an angry response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the State Department that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley stated that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , to which it claims according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally .
I urge China to un@@ condi@@ tionally release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o to go into proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Austria , Germany , Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin that Li@@ u says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing &apos;s news agency Reu@@ ters reported that China had big concerns about whether the vor@@ tex could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada and Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called for China to provide Li@@ u with appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to be cared for by his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room at the hospital and that it is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights commitments , including freedom of expression , and to release the rights blocked for the exercise of these rights .
France and France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry asked China on 29 June to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where he needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there will be no further information whether France will eventually accept him .
Taiwan Fashion Museum in Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of continental affairs in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance to those who advoc@@ ate peaceful means to reform political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu M@@ ei @-@ n@@ u of the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned with Li@@ u on June 28th and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is internationally recognised as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was to be considered a city .
this re@@ mark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the single political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supported Singapore to be considered a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o blog accused the Justice Minister attempting to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we can say that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the sem@@ b@@ lance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in the light of which he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently run by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re of the author@@ itarian rulers appear again , the pre@@ ten@@ tious democr@@ ats , leave the twisted logic , because it fits better to their power .
in the end , during the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , the answers given to his American guests regarding our press , our ju@@ dic@@ ative , our political system were really non @-@ rep@@ lies .
he tar@@ nished the corresponding questions with non @-@ rep@@ ut@@ ations of rational art .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion , as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , which country belongs to our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to elu@@ ci@@ date this point , provided he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
as An@@ on publishes his commentary on the blog , he points out the critics concerning the fact that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ important even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities have been winning a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , which makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement as the leader of a growing generation .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Justice Minister of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what awaits me - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes this is properly associated and aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review breaks the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam commit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good @-@ faith a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian spokes@@ man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , which country will the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since it plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , do they defend their city but not their country ?
whom must our prime minister pay back ?
what is the value of our pink staff card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many Singap@@ ore@@ ans ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of a &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question that is most asked to me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been living in Japan since 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation in which the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his dialogue partner by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook in@@ war@@ dly against anger if they are held for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther me .
for someone who does not know , there is little that makes us Canadi@@ ans different from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all dear Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free healthcare !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you would be confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first : being called &quot; cute , &quot; basically means being idle - just like the ben@@ ign , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The S@@ imp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
to be harmless means to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau concei@@ ves the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; cute . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada down@@ right sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ ates Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , has published a music video that par@@ o@@ ases the j@@ un@@ ta , which in 2014 seized power and in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells them what prec@@ ep@@ ts his girlfriend does . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not specifically political , the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the j@@ un@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the song to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was shared 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policy , particularly in relation to the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary constitution which grants the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision making over important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recruitment change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people viewed by the Jun@@ ta as a critic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often exploited by the authorities in order to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army which monitors online contents and prosec@@ utes people who are accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
Thailand sets a strict ban against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic ) .
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at of the army .
one of the problems that the j@@ un@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax pay@@ ers .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van , before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are imprisoned because they allegedly have caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with lengthy prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song displayed members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut of &quot; The Tri@@ bute to Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost towns in Eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ is@@ ian war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages in the northern part of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are in the basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , East @-@ East , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today mostly Russians and rab@@ bits live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
during the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district was 16@@ ,000 people after it had barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 about 43@@ ,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey residential blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s which are called ch@@ ry@@ sh@@ ch@@ kov@@ kas are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are decay and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it is hard for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do we speak ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is nevertheless clear . &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planned economy of the Soviet Union have meanwhile left the district .
about fifty inhabitants live in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which still house one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies where clothes are dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in their hand , they withdraw immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to be photograph@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it just forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girlfriend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappears .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultiv@@ ating agricultural products for personal needs ) , such as breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable farming .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
during the winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about ten years ago an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a , as it is called in the neighborhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her oldest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will stay in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia for ever , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial support from her daughter and insi@@ sts that instead she supports her young grand@@ children .
gall@@ inas monthly pension are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ aly@@ a tells us that she and other vill@@ agers are trying to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when holidays are , we visit ourselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; aun@@ t G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s conversation partner Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she re@@ members the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the West of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia just broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha acqu@@ ires about $ 9 child allow@@ ance for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once was , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
she tells us that it was a very sc@@ ary situation at first when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time , it lost its anxi@@ ousness .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived as they were right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as our conversation comes to an end , a little boy runs past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they are running , some of them throw stones on the ru@@ ined buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which is responsible for in@@ fertility in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez inaugur@@ ates a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border from Mexico to Guatemala .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner P@@ RI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold colored ear@@ rings in t@@ ed@@ dy bear shape .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Afrika .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather they themselves ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians , who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 per night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants are coming here .
sometimes , tells Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez , people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to cry out : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some of them already slept on boxes outside .
she does not want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , buying them drugs that they cannot pay , she mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if M@@ um Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ ghurt mu@@ sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her , as African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister hoping to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
they have already lived in Brazil , but for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States , it is normal to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker for the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at M@@ om Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send their text messages when they have gone to greet them or to report on the course of their trip .
it declares that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have contributed to preparing chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold at expensive .
he started to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking area outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people can help and others don &apos;t help others . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that in Honduras he has fled with his wife and three children in front of people who wanted to black@@ mail his money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for accommodation and an unknown person , a single student , offered him a roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where to go the next step .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests again .
in the ais@@ les , the passengers quietly check their tel@@ eph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia .
MS Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
she looks like a proud grand@@ mother in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughters with African hair care she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she puts her in front of me .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; she &apos;s gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users .
residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi held a mobile phone notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities also used to make use of the app for more than fighting terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture , because , shortly after they had installed the app , they exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the news release , the police stated that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and the distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ z &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a service service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app with filters for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable government actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to monitor digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China are mostly focused on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , repres@@ sed ethnic minorities such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ orship and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( &quot; The Netherlands &quot; ) , which cens@@ ored news published in China , showed photos from a check@@ point where police checked the residents random@@ ly as to whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are using a check@@ point with a device without this software , you could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .

a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :

sleep or death , Part 1 : everything cri@@ es out after death
a single cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything important has disappeared .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly identi@@ fiable from both inside and outside .
one that gives honour to their name .
one that has broken down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when reality re@@ stores you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters are transformed into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es out after death .
all doubts settle in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even when the Earth is spinning on the axis of disaster . you realize that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but this was not enough to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn my lesson &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds .
it suff@@ iced that the city sh@@ ook the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; cri@@ es .
all the neighbor@@ hoods were cov@@ eted , just my own not .
for the first time it was silent , mo@@ tion@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I had no high demands on a city that has been stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to gather together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we allied ourselves to a splendid image that filled my expectations completely .
in such a moment you realize that you have liber@@ ated the spirit from the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet with the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low , nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel , Gh@@ ass@@ an , stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
the Col@@ onel Gaddafi is beginning to say : &quot; let me also hear you scre@@ am &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; or you are only brave enough to sh@@ out if we are not close . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes set on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you &apos;re really sad to see me in your eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my cause when I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest possible conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary and his father alike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed sentence is still in my nose today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mental torture which I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I remember all the details before I enter the room .
otherwise they probably have allocated a larger cell to me this time .
I have to share it with just one other prisoner and must immediately sit down without waiting for her permission .
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the bureau@@ cra@@ t left the cell , and I res@@ or@@ ted to an ancient method of communication : beating his fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ level was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first@@ ling &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently none of the surrounding cells lay in a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks like me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness there are no apparent faces to me , and there are no doctors here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
maybe he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row of birds to drive out all these crow@@ s , which are lab@@ elled with the fruit in the garden of my head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from a distance , I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams hang , every day .
the door opens .
I have always been convinced that Schwarz is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light which presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; reference to 13 S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be inter@@ ro@@ gated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the secret was thus revealed : to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they speak in the Albanian dialect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the close field of view of their world view .
this is not a house , no land here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the criminal of their cl@@ an into a hero .
I supervis@@ e the listening room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and stock@@ y man ; at least he appears to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he cat@@ ches a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the expressions that gli@@ de on him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than to join these days and protest in demonstrations that will come to an end anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I have grown accustomed to not responding .
I can no longer say exactly when insul@@ ts and blows have become an ordinary means of communication for me .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice within me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to deserve this penalty .
in punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to pull me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably originates from the clo@@ aks .
your hang@@ man delights in your cri@@ es .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot hold back your cri@@ es .
my scre@@ ams didn &apos;t suit him enough , which is why they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a waste collector or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to show us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within one hour three of them changed , while I was still at the turn .
I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I heard scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and didn &apos;t like it , so he reached an electrically charged stick .
power flow@@ ed through my entire body , enough to supply my whole district .
my half @-@ naked body lying stretched out on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which happened to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian rap@@ tor Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and opposition
Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photograph was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he slides back to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , and also to his couch .
but what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his lips adorned with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s family to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as fel@@ o@@ ye@@ es ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who opposed the conservative majority and questioned their well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ture .
with his music , which often deals with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man , but also in cities which range from Damascus in Syria to the whole of San@@ aa in Yemen .
at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by borders in his thinking , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating effects of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even though he does not admit it openly , he has a special dis@@ like against US foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his sympathy for those trying to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as the &quot; Palestinian refugee of the second generation . &quot; he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a human being &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while he po@@ urs in water dissolved n@@ es@@ café into two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
apparently , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a burning hot June day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the sl@@ ats speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the swa@@ ths of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when you take a look at the neighboring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - to not land in prison .
recently , Jordan &apos;s Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic campaign - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front @-@ singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ ai , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert agreement .
in an interview with CN@@ N , the de@@ pu@@ ties and former Press spokesperson in the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said that the concert &quot; just &quot; was cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer .
many also claim that the band &apos;s engagement in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; who continue to advoc@@ ate for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not be simply a rhet@@ oric , but actually reflecting a reality that is becoming more and more evident in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b reg@@ ained traditional gender norms by incorpor@@ ating his vision of the fate of Arab women who had pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an uni@@ denti@@ fied unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust .
over the past few years , the number of &apos; honorary mur@@ ders &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch the number of hon@@ our@@ able kill@@ ings in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support the women victims of attempted murder or domestic violence .
according to a 1954 ban on crime , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be imprisoned for in@@ definite time in prison , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures and the guarantee on the part of the family are necessary for the woman to take nothing .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from topics that have long been considered tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , cannot be separated from politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come out of the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; politics was fed me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse often repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality .
he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of ga@@ ys and les@@ bians and that comments on the equality of LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to see later that his comments were torn out , twisted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed only a edited version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ eva , a po@@ ets of the eighth century , who still remains in memory even today thanks to his homogen@@ ous erotic poetry .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b wonders : if Abu Nu@@ evo , who later should work on behalf of the cali@@ phs , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;s Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom , it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tion attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service held several former members of the Government and members of the teacher &apos;s association with the reason@@ ing that they had cri@@ tically vo@@ iced concern about the problems associated with the corruption that has been deeply rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is a continuous giving and taking . Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - this is how H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , like millions of other Arabs , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experiencing them &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and arti@@ fici@@ ally led demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
until it is ready , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to escal@@ ate and consequently resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these big extravag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
one suppos@@ es that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many regions of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the fe@@ asts , drums and dancing came over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west of Japan came to the Nor@@ theast to force the indigenous people of the region , the em@@ iss@@ i , to their knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can hardly imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint venture in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ j@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have been looking forward to the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ el@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a stunning way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of an 18 metre high wa@@ stage was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange arms against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

outer appearances and body care were rare as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dresser &apos;s .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street noise and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Brazil ) , has led to more and more normal citizens going into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can reproduce these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there experts compete against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos about current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
education facilities such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair art instead of bad advice that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported on some of its successes :
in 1995 we were the only college in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because we have built up this educational community for love with the children .
Colombia : letters of love to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important , people who feel ej@@ ected to receive affection ?
this was exactly the question of the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga of Bo@@ got@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ li@@ aci@@ ón ( letters for reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace agreement with the F@@ ARC guer@@ ri@@ lla movement , which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the Peace Treaty was so significant that Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
but before the Colom@@ bians , there is still a long way to speak about a real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who lived in illegal refugee camps for many years , had been exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried their weapons around the clock , must now re @-@ integrate themselves into the lives of civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , who had grown accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now incorporate them into their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colum@@ bians must unite and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ illa fighters to welcome them back to society .
the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who will then be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation was born at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more .
he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed most urgently .
the idea was to write letters full of hope and support for former Fi@@ fa fighters who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make discourse of a war story into a common history of peace . &quot;
so far more than 2,000 letters have been collected within the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Mani@@ z@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 Let@@ ters were handed over to one of the UN refugee camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region on March 19 .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo von der Stiftung Bo@@ got@@ eine travelled to the camp to transfer the letters in person .
the F@@ ARC members presented themselves as they had done earlier in order to receive the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between , &quot; told the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , one of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go , because next to him lay a M@@ GL @-@ gar@@ net , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to him anyway and asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never written anything such a nice thing in my life , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him very tightly , and put me beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of the war , I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this warri@@ or , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I just learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices and voices
at the beginning , students and some of the F@@ ARC leaders came together for a discussion .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , its ide@@ als , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice by the State has exer@@ ted on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party , we can help shape society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worth overcoming all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear these people who have never heard their ears and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I &apos;ve often seen as monsters and even hate me , are only people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
for example , Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , commander of the camp at Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the following letter to Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i .
the Colom@@ bian was made to know that after the dis@@ arm@@ ament peace would prevail .
but this is not the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people ready to seize the weapons , rise and protest for their rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that is also totally justified ( ... ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we of the F@@ ARC now focus on peace , on a policy without arms .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and sacrifice , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .
a Trans@@ woman talks about the persecution in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and life before Kad@@ y@@ rov

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mac@@ ar@@ ova and its first publication took place on the OC media website .
homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with terror activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the threat that hangs like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert over the local LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q community has not been created overnight .
OC media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic .
several months ago , the LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya conquered international head@@ lines after reports have been published that dealt with the dra@@ gging , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who captured suspi@@ cious men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since childhood she sen@@ sed that she was actually a woman .
when she grew up she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
out of fear for her life she moved to the USA in the end .
Sab@@ rina : I was working as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a Trans@@ woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on October 10 , 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a man &apos;s voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did not hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honour the family , you dish@@ on@@ or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up at the last end of the hospital .
apparently some women had received everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stab wounds in my right lung .
OC Media : in which hospitals have you been laid - in which the men or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are dep@@ rec@@ ated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me up to the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful of me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February , I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all this was a lie .
they put absurd demands : some said to me that I had to prove it by running up without the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I hadn &apos;t changed my gender that everything was just bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They brought a monster to the world , which has corrupted not only your family but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she took a rope around his neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window was a car with dark windows and a number plate with a 95 on it .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was a bit la@@ zy .
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help , I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to invo@@ ke my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought them without registering with me , without knowing anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the garbage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re safe , just because you left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you are stuck . they even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , this is a tab@@ oo theme .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I really take pains to look like the person she rec@@ alls from her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have remained dor@@ man@@ t ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has sat in gun for one and a half months .
he said that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock up a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
with this I mean , they probably invite relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has been experienced by blood .
OC Media : are gay men still held in these myst@@ eries ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there weren &apos;t so many .
if , then especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to stand up to Kad@@ y@@ rov &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they will be held there so that they can present them later as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they had attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were deliberately immersed in order to radic@@ alise themselves .
OC Media : is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in Ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard had grown .
there has been nothing new since then .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person himself was there when these people were taken .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , there have been no reports yet . however , we suspect such actions are possible .
why would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a bo@@ b .
I think that before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was applied , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; originally Russia wanted to introduce us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ci@@ vili@@ zation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately gave us back to the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had tin@@ ted eyel@@ ashes , wore tube je@@ ans and short tops .
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never just cur@@ bed me a hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met me .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; mock is not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never struck .
OC Media : how long did this time of grace last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality in television .
he did not speak about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women .
nevertheless - you could sense how people in town started to change .
he who smil@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at first looked at you with suspicion .
in the meantime I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic deteri@@ or@@ ated steadily .
OC Media : what activity are you going to work now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ ups , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t have a cent for that .
I discovered these people by themselves when I cl@@ apped breeding places .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that is sil@@ ly .
this is the nature that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who wish to make you white with foam in front of the mouth that there are no wa@@ iling for them .
the Da@@ ge@@ stan@@ es have which , the cab@@ ard@@ ines , which , the Russians have also which ; on the whole planet , they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
you know , many think of mer@@ ch@@ iness on men who love men , and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling , to be precise , different attitudes towards life .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know I &apos;m myself now .
local groups warn of an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
there has been a strong increase in suicide since the last few months .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 pushed the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ ra@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ ra@@ zi &apos;s human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ ra@@ z and want to remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could no longer do anything .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take their lives .
the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ ha Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have imposed .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who were hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe job because of the persecution of the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its livel@@ ihood .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy assumed power and , in 1925 , under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran .
in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the rich@@ est and most valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives little from this wealth .
it is often victims of ill @-@ treated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Arabs jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a variety of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are surrounding .
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused in the region by d@@ rought , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi participants increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , Iranian general director of co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ ra@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job completed primary school , 55 % completed secondary school and 45 % have university degrees .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ mad human rights activ@@ ist , resi@@ ding in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ ra@@ zi men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans coming from Ah@@ ra@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since function@@ aries and institutions do not pre@@ tend to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of the national resistance of young Arabs and comp@@ elling them to earn their living outside their home country of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their affili@@ ation with the Ah@@ ra@@ zi and to be employed , since even Arab names at the workplace are not tolerated , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi have to endure , human rights activists suggest alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Comm@@ ons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement auth@@ ored by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website of A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay out well @-@ thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should generally be female .
for example , despite the same education women still earn less money than men nowadays .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later encounter a glass ceiling in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and fai@@ ths .
all this is known and known to me .
I am convinced of this and I suffer dou@@ bly and triple of it .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to skin color , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I speak of how we have always been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists decide to keep silent .
however , all agree that women - all women - should come together in order to &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about the fact that there is an additional institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , which we are exposed to black women in a tw@@ o@@ fold manner .
or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , men and all men of all skin color to have the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands who refuses to consider injus@@ tices in her thinking , which relate to both sex and skin colour of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; jour@@ ne@@ y@@ man compl@@ ained in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to uph@@ old an ideology in which the black woman in an historical sense is a dish@@ on@@ est and margin@@ alized being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c programme .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to teach them for the better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women from different backgrounds a home and isol@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; still exists in its name .
I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and join the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of applying for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we black women define us according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana possibly : claims . ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ismus : as we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) speaks of how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can in this way also create spaces where the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which constitute the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can raise black women and women from other cultures , as in this paradig@@ m I exist .
because of my dark skin and because of my being as a woman , I am recognized as a part of this paradig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can blossom in an environment in which my life has neither passed , nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems .
within the scope of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a particular concern by the Kur@@ dist@@ an area in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no more water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia von E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist .

Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain about the women &apos;s murder in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay &quot; by cur@@ sory . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # soft @-@ cat@@ chy ) reporting about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a police commission@@ er told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had been violent against her .
since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena for mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , the well @-@ known display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez did not use anything .
a few days later the second wife withdraw@@ s her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
when women make an announcement at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit being victims of violence should report to law enforcement agencies at all .
In@@ halt@@ 1 Stri@@ kes and statistics 2 In@@ visible abuse and a judicial system that no under@@ vol@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , inadequate conversion impacts and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studio , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various statements and reports which , however , do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the available figures , however , are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads were reported to the District At@@ tor@@ ney General for domestic violence . 70 % of them were about violence against women .
86 % of the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the courts of peace . 86 % of the ads of women came here .
in the adver@@ ts 40 % of women reported that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics however do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ard@@ i , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are 9 women who don &apos;t do this in Paraguay because of the psychological abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two women who don &apos;t have to do this because of physical abuse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because there is no criminal off@@ ence in Paraguay , law enforcement agencies cannot appropriately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year .
in August 2016 alone , journalists numbered at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , a woman dies in Paraguay every ten days due to violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that does not under@@ mine
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she named him the name of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want it , but then gave up . this should always regret her .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . for two years she bore the psych@@ ic force on her part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never thought that I would be victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people replied to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had so long enjoyed it and did not leave it earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse were at least a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria San@@ tos , which is not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the Paragu@@ ay@@ an authorities to prove that their former partner ab@@ used them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to one another and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives , they received no support .
she carried out a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ a@@ geable legal fight between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ay@@ ways laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good but cannot be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Women &apos;s Organization in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill of bill was discussed at the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # für@@ st ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original draft of the law stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ ini@@ d should be declared an independent criminal offen@@ se and punish the harder as it is already the case in neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the wording of the law was changed in a number of points , so as to convince the members of the law which feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is prohibited , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and be punished with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill was intended to cover most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs which the victims of violence must bear on their own , if they simply want to refund sums and receive a secure accommodation to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
a re@@ think must take place here , so that violence can no longer be regarded as something normal .
those who are silent in the face of these facts are complic@@ it and contribute to the fact that the perpet@@ rators get away offen@@ sively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reimbur@@ se for such a long time until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer regarded as normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been amended , including a passage that the partners called in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation .
opinions on the changes are taking place .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a big set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman one year after the prohibition of a newspaper continues to be attacked
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed on the homepage of the banned paper az@@ am@@ n on the basis of a resolution of the Minister of Information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the French authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking daily Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tan .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he served a one year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried in court , but later released .
Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after having dismissed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sul@@ tan , the chief officer in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is marked by the harsh efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic secret services , civil liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , and torture human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically restrict peace and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n paper , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its foundation in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , noted that an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties bound hands of justice &quot; was published in the paper on July 26 , 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of pressur@@ ing judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to uph@@ old a verdict in a her@@ edi@@ tary dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a member of the editorial committee , was invited by the ISS to the Special Department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS adher@@ ed to the deputy chief editor , You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ fia &apos;s arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the directive that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the paper in any way , including online , banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place in Mas@@ k@@ at on 26 September 2016 .
the Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , inter alia , for distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ mining of the state &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a public ban and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year jail sentences and fin@@ es of 3,000 square ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network for the dis@@ semination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a security deposit of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was det@@ ained and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following his six @-@ month prison sentence from the Central Pr@@ ison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , serving his one @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to come again , the newspaper continues to be exposed to attacks by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed another statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister ordered another time against the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re@@ press the publication of the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the paper are not the only cases in which the freedom of the press in Oman has recently been viol@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operations .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression arises that the French authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R , calls on the Thom@@ istic authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman un@@ block their legitimate human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including legal ch@@ ic@@ anes .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R , is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization supporting human rights advoc@@ ates ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and adjacent countries by promoting freedom of expression and association , and the right to gather , support and protect peace .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his approval
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media . this is a growing area addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research to be carried out on site : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing in the offer of global health care , which cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have a far greater impact in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the phar@@ ma companies is a major problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists will help build up their own research capacities in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Research on Inf@@ ectious Dis@@ eases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post @-@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched the HIV virus himself before deciding to go back home to support the Serbian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ ner discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings in the media about this research .
( disc@@ laim@@ er : Dr. War@@ ner speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ bian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
CC : what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and generally in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no fundamental research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always remain bene@@ fici@@ aries instead of being do@@ ers themselves .
the solutions we get are often not well used in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
CC : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently well .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , because funding and opportunities for development are better in other countries .
CC : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
CC : what is the opinion of the general public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
CC : what is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it concentrate on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is astonishing .
I saw great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
the social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this .
GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa in comparison to Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : it is often the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the United States to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change world food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine dealing with solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton bred a salad in the USA since the 1980s .
his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ dit , the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many types of salads he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding .
the patents are not only applied to individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cur@@ led leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or car@@ rots . due to this trend , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
Mor@@ ton is still fond of let@@ tu@@ ce as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , but it now takes longer because his work is more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if a b@@ oul@@ der in a river is lying around which I have to d@@ wind@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when they stand trial , no one can breed a new type of salad because all the characteristics are already patented . &quot; he continues to do as much as possible and tries to breed those characteristics that he wants .
however , it is very cau@@ tious and endeav@@ ours to use no material protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the United States and around the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red red@@ dish salad of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; variety in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the station . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiative ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was created in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are therefore permanently usable for plant bree@@ ders .
in the context of the initiative , shortly named O@@ ss@@ i , US bree@@ ders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds raised by them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; bree@@ ders only allow others who buy their seeds , cross it to breed their own varieties , and not immediately exclude them - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the em@@ eri@@ zed professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of the seed and the ability to grow new plants is important for food security and environmental protection .
according to seed , seed plays a role in larger groups such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement does not deal with genetically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seeds , &quot; says he and takes on the increasingly common mer@@ gers of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Bayer , which are offered in August and September 2016 . &quot; anyone who wants to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables should also know that the manner in which this vegetables is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative join forces to keep their seed freely available to others . in contrast , their approach is in contrast to pat@@ enting seeds and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore increasingly restricted .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , Executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all the car@@ rots is protected as intellectual property , which makes it usable for plant bree@@ ders either at all or only difficult .
there are no such estimates for other plants yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that massive cultivated plants such as wheat are patented in more scale than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are bred in such a way that they are specifically desired characteristics - from those through which their taste or colour is improved to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and resist threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bree@@ ders is decreasing through more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognis@@ es that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
it contradic@@ ts , however , that intellectual property holds other bree@@ ders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant variations &quot; promote innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method .
such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovations , but encourages them by making more material and know @-@ how available to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees this different : waiting for 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to grow plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have already lost the fight .
however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders do not have the time or money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want to make farmers their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it is impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
overall , Mor@@ ton is interfer@@ ing with the concept of pat@@ enting plant characteristics : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the features ourselves .
the plants themselves form it themselves and as a bree@@ der we have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Caro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US State Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; if you breed a variety , you also breed its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures are needed for their cultivation of massive her@@ bi@@ cides , which breeds into its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is very opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as moving on international markets but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) have patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case .
the independent bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for salads at his breeding garden .

Mor@@ ton is also convinced that bree@@ ders would be more innovative by avoiding crop patents : &quot; it looks like I am more than a company with my efforts to produce something new .
I constantly need new material for my catalog , as I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent one is protected against competition for 20 years , which makes it very easy in my opinion . &quot; worldwide resonance
although the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . to preserve the seed of traditional crops , the Centre works with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German organisation Agre@@ col is working on an open @-@ source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bree@@ ders in the European Union .
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , so the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot be easily taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally cultivated plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . this refers to the current practice of the European Patent Office that allows patents on conven@@ tionally cultivated plants .
one explanation , however , is not a law ; now it is up to the member states &apos; governments to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from across East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend to pat@@ enting seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; Program for Open Source Se@@ ed Systems , declares that the organization is currently building a global alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for the planned launch of the official start @-@ up next year .
a combination of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - has published a summary of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report in which it believes that farmers must have the opportunity to participate in seeds , to exchange it and to help shape the seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that hopes that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon see him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and organic food has especially been taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role in this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ by says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people realize that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of the C@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock the content on the internet .
this time it was the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of the 5th of August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities cri@@ tically critici@@ zed this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains committed to defending freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world in spite of this attack and the mo@@ ck@@ ery of the Egyptian right and the constitution . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these aims , it was never as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome and not to give up . we ins@@ ist on fulfilling our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , for example the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network because of alleged &quot; support for terrorism . &quot;

apart from AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada also has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the dis@@ semination of columns and articles , which he writes not to accessible websites and media for Egypt .
now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government was the goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider in which also Canada &apos;s blog is located , on the other hand , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , reporting on the student protests and recorded a video on how the police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government &apos;s lock and reflected what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even though the blo@@ gging of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) I succeeded in giving me the feeling of a state of siege ; a arrest , attempted murder , invitation to the National Security Council , blocked blo@@ gs , and any other web page I worked for .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write for nothing . in other words : my words have influence , even if only a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post items to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship .
but now after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave ones walk the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and ET@@ IS@@ A@@ LA@@ T .
af@@ te also documented the block@@ age of vendors , where Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing were possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the block@@ age of websites offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s started .
such a practice suggests the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users could have access to .
in addition , the situation is wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the decision @-@ making decisions are taken behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which it can proceed to court against these acts .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ orship and whom will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day newspapers in the whole of Brazil are reporting with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is killed , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bing pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tim@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air@@ ship to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the 2017 violence threshold in Rio achieved the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organisation of Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published in Rio for detailed reporting on violence in Rio was published in the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the paper explains the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city in the world , such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crimes , etc . all that happens in the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to cry out : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war break in a country that doesn &apos;t recognise the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same video , a newspaper journalist explains that according to the Institute of In@@ ner Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues to write :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police which only shoots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it uses ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence is a &quot; war . &quot; this is in her opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to be held accoun@@ table by the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent negl@@ ect of public service .
to remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie in the north and northeast of the country according to the statistics of 2015 . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per federal state , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Glob@@ o company , the largest media company in South America , has recently under@@ lined the importance of the state &apos;s security policy for years .
one of these security policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit appointed by Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to capture a F@@ av@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police custody and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . however , after several years , the U@@ PP has been increasingly under attack after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also ent@@ ails serious consequences for the people .
for this requires the state to use means and ways typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; stra@@ ined bul@@ lets . &quot;
the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio are still suffering .
a week ago , the police cleared the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ ar@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : an or@@ phan@@ ed died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal sieg@@ es and block@@ ades , chi@@ ef@@ ly through the Assad regime facing loyal troops .
according to the Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organisation PA@@ X and the Syria Institute research institute , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b are currently around a million Syrians in a state of siege .
the region east Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume , based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege , which led to the fact that local inhabitants are dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points .
due to the lon@@ gla@@ sting block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian assistants and ac@@ adem@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own fung@@ i as a &quot; life saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ interven@@ da and carry out the project jointly with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the common foods cultivated in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ tly of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , spoke to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose cultivation of mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and bas@@ ements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that for three years it has been fighting to make this project known and express its relief that it is now becoming more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gaining awareness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to raise funds for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crowd funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ ni@@ da .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge about the planting of mushrooms , such as Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators holding the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the shortage of fuel , locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of mushrooms origin@@ ating from regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i throughout Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frac@@ ture of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source in the market .
dis@@ semination of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cart@@ on , etc . ) for the extraction of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege will become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district capitals in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires ra@@ ging in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government proclaimed a state of state last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
bran@@ dies were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire break@@ outs spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy oc@@ cured in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite ima@@ gery , some 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is only in 4 districts no fire .
all of Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a . ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017

numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the magnitude of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al from the Federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for anything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits are questioned in locations with high fire risk .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the form of forests , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the commun@@ es who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; the government introduced a sl@@ ack@@ ening of the law which allowed the construction activity case to fall if the applicant had funds for self @-@ defence - that was an open backdoor , so everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val continues in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co .
the environmental organisation Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily combus@@ tible wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , spread further and further according to fires of this type .
in addition to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when residents were looking for information or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used their own civil protection data with the help of the application fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who watched the fires : the site counted more than half a million hits .

two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups defeated by the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan last time together with his family at dinner .
even though his mother did not say so at that time , she knew she wouldn &apos;t see her son much longer - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy was supposed to break up .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran . once again , he found himself in a foreign land along with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars that were heavier than himself to earn his living .
back then , like today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ shar@@ k in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , where we worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were no services and no heating there . we hung nylon in front of the open windows , so that we didn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af had left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after rej@@ ecting his application for asylum in Greece , A@@ shar@@ af moved to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church , which distributed food to the needy two times a day .
it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high twin quot@@ as . however , it is also true that the conditions applying to asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes that the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to an admission centre if they have formally requested an application for asylum - which may result in months after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either depend on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
that &apos;s how it was called A@@ shar@@ af .
but his bound@@ less li@@ fest@@ y@@ les helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions .
after having worked for several years in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put all his savings into the creation of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries .
in recent years , some Afgh@@ ans run business , including tail@@ oring , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his Orient Experience restaurant , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp in Pad@@ ua ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome also stand in Afghanistan .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals reach far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers and aim to return to the country that he had to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as everyone else . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; so they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
N@@ eti@@ zen Report : draft law dra@@ fts from Egypt enable shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for over 900 days in prison .
he reported on the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ v@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the removal of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys N@@ eti@@ zen Report is an international snapshot showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that stipul@@ ates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration with a government authority .
in order to be able to use social networks , users must register within six months of successful legislative decision on the authority &apos;s website stating their full name and identity number .
those who failed to take this step could be sentenced to a sentence of up to six months or the end of a sentence .
the law , which was applied by sixty parliam@@ ent@@ arians , is currently on the right hand to the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May another member of Parliament filed a legislative proposal in which harder pun@@ ish@@ ments would be introduced to insul@@ t the president or a senior official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under Egyptian law , the insul@@ t of the President as well as government institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the legislative proposal , such a crime would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the law be passed , this can mean up to three years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imprisonment for convic@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger already for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who captured Egyptian police officers while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan was expecting more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested during the same incident four years in prison for a trial date .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to the 20th May because the prison management of the human rights groups failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan also threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree that the apparent burden of inter alia weapons collection , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in Gi@@ za acqu@@ itted two journalists , H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of pro @-@ mor@@ si bean block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the aforementioned case , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activists are inter@@ ro@@ gated to skill@@ ful documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours hearing Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices advoc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly inter@@ ro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , which according to the plan explicitly endor@@ sed a controversial draft law , which would assure business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption accused of with@@ holding all illeg@@ ally received funds .
the document published on April 21 , on Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website , sheds light on how the Pres@@ idential plans look for the support of the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia lo@@ aned the attri@@ bution of his sources by specifying Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which authori@@ zes journalists to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared in the case of a witness in the district court in Tunis on 9 May .
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification ?
according to the new rules of the Information Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share news in social media .
it is also stated in the rules that registering with full real name will be required .
analysts suggest that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks . until now , it is unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to en@@ force these rules only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence .
let &apos;s see then in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizer of the dis@@ semination of information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian Government conduc@@ ts a list of online services that organise the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for the removal of content and to force it on request to susp@@ end user data .
these web pages currently include websites such as V@@ kontakte and Od@@ no@@ by@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court decre@@ es Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as locking in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site was blocked because it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a source of information that co @-@ operates with groups in order to create a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is thus , besides , China , one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain cannot stop sn@@ u@@ ff@@ ling
after this week &apos;s le@@ aked documents , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation regarding increased surveillance powers , which would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install malware programs that dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population out@@ war@@ dly .
in spite of all this , the consultation will continue until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
