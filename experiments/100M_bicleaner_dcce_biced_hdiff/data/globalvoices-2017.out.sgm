<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges, who were inclined to his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "I was as if it was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose variety is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very fanatical love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he perishes with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never thinks about the mountain behind the mountain, as one says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted in favour of him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican preselection was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the Journalism Program, which includes people from all over the world, a deeply believer man with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps's worldview coincided with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix Suns playing.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who struggles the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to Kristi's commitment, which always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleague to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wiser advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump broke his way to the nominee Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out however that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly whites, were presidents of a man, despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The debate with the idea that people voted for dumping because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ordering people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful, and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those electors, most of whom know, have voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps. maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commenting on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "whitelash" (CWC.): as much as white against all other ethnicities, "white and whiplash word play, as the great Van Jones described it, has killed exactly what America has made so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background you may always have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country, as its president, chose the son of a Kenyan twice, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, with the election Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the White Americas on this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">All this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd responded with a loud" "" "no!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried and their voices grew louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would someone who is not like you, have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, is that not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And it breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of Vicente Guerrero commune in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura in common?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played in both places has changed not only the life of the children, but also a very close link with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill site, only 16 km south of Oaxaca and # 8212; an old colonial town that is very popular with tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now, La banda de Música (Musikbande) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for Vicente Guerrero's community in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its abuse of drugs and bananas.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and gave the youth a rare hope for hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shining eyes and play in the bustle you learn day after day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the Conga to play.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village that is located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments made from local solid waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments under the direction of Favio Chávez.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violin, viola, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all of which were made out of the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire encompasses classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article from the Los Angeles Times Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">At first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in garbage. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something that he had never seen before: a violin made of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of reprocessed material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world generates about one billion tons of garbage.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring performance of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played its music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully tackle illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Voices for the joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">Back then in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia's waters before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were correspondingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this type on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly, the prime minister was surrounded by countries you simply refused to do," "" "Benedict Kiilu recalls, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not possible for him to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to pillage of the fish stocks of the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 was founded by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the premier out of their waters back then.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries who are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and support each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, so it is extremely difficult to track down. thus illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By intentionally ignoring existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, IUU fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were formerly hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also by the snail pace, with the information between individual countries, the actions happen nowadays in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communications platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships even if they move on the open seas, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to flag ships that fish in forbidden areas. also, suspicious cycling routes can be discovered - such as those suggesting that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the involved ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal law.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports on the basis of this information. which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay punishments, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there are considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supporting FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue, which lost the eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of illegal fishermen who invade east African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include activities such as sailing under false flag, fake licence papers, phantasies, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non-uninterrupted control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say" "" "You must not run my port." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "yet another country could say" "" "Come to me." "" "and this legal loophole is trying to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">The closed front has been working so far.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It revealed criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several deceitful identities and it has persecuted and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to his co-operation with INTERPOL, the international authority for the fight against crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to track down the illegal ships that like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fishery data and provides technical support to FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, switch off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Therefore, Copeland helps build a system that combines different levels of information. it is intended to help FISH-i find criminal-acting ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth launched the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization, Oceana: a platform that provides satellite data and, by means of which the position of each traceable vessel can be displayed worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of who is doing, it simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to pool their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities do not only detect criminals but also scare them off.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously had been fishing without a license and hardly had any consequences, now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i are now seeing a 33% increase in fisheries turnover since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors aboard towing nets where prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that other countries now also copy us," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we have become a study object." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries joined the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. "With certainty, the aim is to make even more of such initiatives and structures in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia was able to report its first major triumph: in October Greko 1, a ship that was on the way under false flag. and not only was the ship on the way without a license and were used towing nets, which are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also invaded into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1 set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative approach to the protection of the oceans actually works across the world ocean. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are deemed to be a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After rejecting Venezuela's proposal for a referendum on a referendum, the Venezuelans, in whose eyes the negotiations on the country's political and economic crisis, ran into the void by gathering in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (e.g. the refund of Venezuela) pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andes-regions of Mérida and Táchira, in the central-north-located Bundestag Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country continues to deteriorate, which is reflected in the everyday life of the Venetians by an acute lack of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the removal of the current president Nicolás Maduro; ultimately, the attitude of a re-election was blocked by official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, Co-Contributors at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">Within the framework of the social, political and economic crisis in which the inflation and violence rates are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% to the annual financial statements) and in which there is a serious and far-reaching deficiency in food and medicine, the referendum on impeachment was the only way to give the country the chance to recapture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance of Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or shortly MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces, called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly on 27 October. in addition, a twelve-hour strike on the Folgetag and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan Government, should continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among other things, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">As far as Venezuela: tomorrow National Assembly, Friday nationwide Civil War and on 3 November all went to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="171">The pictures of the marches that are published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country, but also disputes with policemen as well as supporters of the government.</seg>
<seg id="172">One of the most frequently shared pictures shows a protesters calling through the shields: "will you kill me because I am hungry?"</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter, images that tell of disputes as well as reports of oppression and mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="177">Especially big waves struck the news about police repression in the central-north-located town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advocates of the government according to their own testimony.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could leave the cathedral again safely, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop police forces, including this woman in the Andenstaat (Táchira):</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira don't wear a skirts, because otherwise one could see something that many National Guard did not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic is already doing the round that depicts the level of oppression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the call for a tenure proceedings - it was now proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the street.</seg>
<seg id="185">Myteks Media Labs about it:</seg>
<seg id="186">Nicolás and Diosdado declare that 1% of signatures are fake.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here is your removal!</seg>
<seg id="188">On the road!</seg>
<seg id="189">Others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that, from their point of view, did little against the devastating economic crisis and rather engaged in congesting critical voices:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">Marches always increase in frequency and intensity.</seg>
<seg id="192">Some Venezuelans reported to the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike rather than working or shopping.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview given by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 at Día a Día, an Argentinean news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take a look at the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city of Cordoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now told his father in the large La Perla Ribera process in the province of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">He kept family secrets for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I believed that this was all right.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child of 15 years, one doesn't notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not see that my father was a thief, torturer and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto Quijano was a police officer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the intelligence division 141 at La Perla prison from 1976 to 1978.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Records of the archive.</seg>
<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation for himself.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">The first and last time he was waiting for me at the entrance of the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - simply everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small packet wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it I saw that there was a large lump of silver inside.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen objects were stopped and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured there.</seg>
<seg id="238">I saw in and saw a couch that men were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later on I found out that they fortified the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person lying there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They tied a man with handcuffs to the bed, cast him over with water and drove him a load of 220 volts to the genitals.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong their driving licence, witnessed a very special misfortune in the last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">In a sign the Japanese word was used for the Japanese word "(koreisha), which means" older drivers "wrongly - but perhaps also with a malicious interior thought & # 8212; it was translated as" awful motorists. "</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine, which has been widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also who drew attention to the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, which appears in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could there be such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult for older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable," "" "said Holmes." ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The defective English translation was initially removed. the term "terrible drivers") was replaced later by the more appropriate, though grammatically not quite correct term "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The Kyoto prefecture did not apologize for translation errors. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported the apologies as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are sorry that older people felt insulted by the inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">"" "the Japanese online news service J-Cast News dealt with the phenomenon of" "" "terrible" "" "older drivers in Japan and wrote:" ""</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of elderly drivers, who are involved nationwide in accidents, is quite a cause for concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a 10% share.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens created 1.803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>

<seg id="375">Photo of Flickr-User Andrew.</seg>
<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue, who could translate the translation into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translation, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees, can still make translations internally. then the Japanese employee, whose English skills are valued as the best, is made to be a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also common - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and mysterious phrases that arise through mechanical translations show that this technique can't replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English phrases in Japan, including the puzzling prints that often adorn T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable, or at least harmless as jewellery, but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more accurate translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: protests and censorship measures to take place on the internet and television</seg>
<seg id="391">Main site of the "Navajo con Libertad" portal (Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they wouldn't have access to the online channel Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later on other users wrote that the websites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters also transposed recordings of the protest in Caracas, which were organized by oppositional groups that oppose the government Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and writer at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the connection was scarce and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Censorship: enable your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are again closed.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as an "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I registered at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is astonishing that this is still cheaper than buying two liters of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO called VEsinktro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two additional online transmitters. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transmits its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technology through which the DNS servers answer requests for specific domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a web page is blocked by the DNS, the server responds correctly or refuses to request the request when calling out such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS block: @ elcapitol, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked channel, the transmission was discontinued on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who performed the protests in Caracas live, was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten as he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">He was released eight hours later, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible through YouTube, it was reported that the government regulates internet connections: this makes it more difficult for Venezuelans to gain access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("Flying cows, falling schools"), edited and republished by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation from university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one who has become something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began to work as Criadita for the family. as Criadita, in Paraguay there are more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers her underage son or her underage daughter to another, richer family. in exchange, the child receives food, training and a roof over her head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children will have to do countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice referred to as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a couple of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls affected by the Criadazgo's practice - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude which is inoculated to the Criadita in general guarantees silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, whose daughter is in the belief that she will complete her training, improve her position in society and "make something out of herself," to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family, whom the girl receives with him and justifies his exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance, who would otherwise have no education and might even be starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is abused, his family will experience it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the phenomenon hitherto relatively unknown, which takes place in the hiding place in Paraguayan households, has a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín came to hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of violent beats. she died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military hospital Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira went on a stick to Marín until she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela accounted for the Criadazgo Criadazgo's deep-rooted practice for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and called for "no further Carolina" to be available in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely spread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered than children," Tina Alvarenga complained.</seg>
<seg id="449">"" "" "" "without papers, it is much easier to infringe the rights of children without impunity." ""</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents, it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín could be trend-setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited as workers, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to use bankruptcy and her father lost his job.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as a Criadita to the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employers Alvarenga worked between four and six hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time in such a way that she would still have time to learn.</seg>

<seg id="500">Picture by Pixabay, modified by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentarians have recently voted to draft legislation on "regulating the use and benefits of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">When adopted by Parliament, users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">"" "" "" "on the basis of the law, a place would be set up that is tasked with granting citizens a permit to use social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with acceptance of the law, users would have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, it could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill that consists of six paragraphs and circulates in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent defines social media as any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video surveillance and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose registration on users. unclear is also how they should identify those who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">RiyadAbdul Sattar, MP and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users who received a username and password from the Ministry of Communications to get through the firewall that Facebook blocks. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. due to that, it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to file information about their identity in order to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on the spot are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist, the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights (EIPR, in German 'Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights'), said Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "I strongly believe in the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt related to things that have to do with technology." ""</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion they imagine that just as they violently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take them seriously, it means that they will establish a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request a permit or not. and that means a mad system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to trial.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "" "" "to be passed as a law, the draft must first be discussed under Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not, the draft is in line with a pro-military way of thinking in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and safeguarded that no deviating narration is present on the image surface, "says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, Tamer El-Shahawy, MP, proposed a bill of legislation against cyber crime, in which a life-long prison sentence was provided for those found guilty to threaten "public order" and "to protest against protests."</seg>

<seg id="524">This article by Todd Reubold was published in the original on Ensia.com, a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions. this article is published here as part of an agreement for content sharing.</seg>
<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the northeast of Iraq, the animal welfare campaigner Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists of the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the leopards, who strike through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor). altogether, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered because of wilderei, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza shows in the video, "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and thriving of the ecosystem depends on the fact that a big predator is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard actually in the wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera bag, Raza gets out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist, Raza loves to show a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">Since 2013, it has been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group and is committed to providing protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan region.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for northeastern Japan, highlighted the progress made over the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a huge earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture Miyagi was a couple of prefectures in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had let entire coastal towns disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Fukushima prefecture has even experienced an atomic accident. 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local perspective which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The newspaper's detailed report contains both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement buildings (for example, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to see the biggest success among the three prefectures, 80 per cent of the planned replacement buildings were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima is the final light of 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, six years after the catastrophe, one still tries to resettle the evacuation of temporary shelters (for example, the kasetsu juchaku) in definitive replacement buildings.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in temporary shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate were still living in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the Fukushima evacuation in 2011 still lives in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuation homes, who were in temporary shelters after the disaster, were resettled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung was able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by misfortune, opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial rebuilding in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are in operation again, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have grown extensively in the three prefectures of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi recovered 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima are located in the Nuclear Sperrgebiet.</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains far away.</seg>
<seg id="567">The number of tourists in Miyagi and Iwate is up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwellers, it is more difficult to find their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine the overall picture, the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuation. she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how her indignation has changed against the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to find out more about the tsunami awareness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents said that there was still not enough in the case of disasters prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">For those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition to commemorate the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper upgraded their attention to the situation of the Fukushima evacuation.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima not only had to experience the huge earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also a witness of the worst, disastrous, nuclear accident that Japan had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Nearly 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture by 160,000 people evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been resettled into permanent replacement buildings.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017, there are still 40,000 residents of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophes most of the evacuation centres are older than 50 years old in temporary shelters. it is known to them that the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima need to compete with massive construction projects. this is construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When one meets people from other countries who speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater at first than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often realises that it binds more than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look at these global connections. in our Into the Deep podcast we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherini explains how a migration has consolidated its affection to Iranian culture; Violeta Camarasa recalls the lack of shared language skills during a journey in the rural China; Adriana Macias talks about the time he has gathered with people from around the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="594">Reight: Mateus Ferreira da Silva on a widespread photo.</seg>
<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week. last Friday, a police officer had beaten him against his head during a demonstration in Goiânia. millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march against austerity measures.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Goiás, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated him on this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, spreading rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás knew that Sampaio was suspended until the conclusion of the investigation into the incident by the active ministry.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer how he hits the face of the student Mateus Ferreira in Goiânia with his headstock (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten up by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be visible for six months on TV and all the oppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desolalizador," a press channel of media activists from Goiânia, shared the video taken from Luiz da Luz on the net, in which one sees Mateus attacked by the police officer and several paramedics shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from a different perspective, has also appeared on social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus who lives in another state, Internet users have meanwhile donated 10,000 Brazilians reais (about 2,700 euros) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Goiânia while lying in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls for further attacks against activists in Goiás:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás is experiencing a wave of political violence: here, the activist Guilherme Irish was murdered by his father, because he was involved in the Occupy movement in secondary schools. here, the military police of a WhatsApp group had been sabotaged by a gas leak, and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a police officer who has hit him with a headstock.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police Handles</seg>
<seg id="615">"" "" "" "Goiás was not the only state in Brazil in which last Friday it was a brutal police action against demonstrators." ""</seg>
<seg id="616">Police officers took protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had set up a stage for orators, rubber bullets and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MP Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to renounce violence against demonstrators via loudspeakers.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media has swapped street protests by directing the focus to another unexpected protagonist: a window pane.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de São Paulo specifically reported a broken glass window to illustratively design their titles with a photo.</seg>
<seg id="621">O Globo, on the other hand, preferred a cover story with a bus set in fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than over the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of material damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too, the term "vandalism" obtains an absurd, disproportionate meaning, and the typical acts of violence of the military police are covered by headlines with the title "demonstrators on the course of confrontation with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">The Uncharted Villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Álvaro Reynoso's law, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular commune of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the Western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is widely known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the fall, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its plants until only the framework of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resign and commute daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran who is rising every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry doesn't rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long inactive time are back in operation because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry powered off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality has already seen better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated and hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production goal was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centuries per pound, according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring started in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">The following years saw the closure of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats most is "fraud."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents said the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to receive, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first Jubilee year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was a matter of officially written documents, which differed only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was taken over and the letters became more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut-down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, waits for retirement in another complex, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the shutdown of the factory in which he helped to build.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he disassembled one of his 31 years of work.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work truck was wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, no alternatives were created for the work places and services that the plants were generating in the communities in which they were located.</seg>

<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory closed, or better said than they began to picture it, they also stopped to asphalve the road, this also disadvantaged other farms.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youth of the first Nations communities across Canada are concerned with topics that are important to them. they do this via hip-hop, thanks to a series of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked with ten Cree communities in Montreal and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop-Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop goes up with the fact that the young participants learn topics like "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self-acceptance," or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are the inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the strain of Winnebago in the State of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumeb First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a street section in Western Canada, where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation is using the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs in spite of the influences of globalisation is.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people were not always able to speak the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop group, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcript as well as a translation into English translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as a youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise someday</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This way they can grow and move forward as well as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see in front of almost every restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, near the entrance shokuhin sanlou (the "plastic models of the dishes") are displayed by any dish served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers will see these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are a number of small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend turns them into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets today.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanlou.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new mobile tapes decorated with plastic grilles, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial food were turned into kitschy collective objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food supplies is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an imperial-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here's an apple that holds your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some Handy-Stands and Handy-designers will allow you to make your own artwork. in this case ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with salmon" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form, so as to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other whimsical plastic dishes can be found at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # of the blog? or??????.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and killed periodically appear only in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings.</seg>
<seg id="750">The report on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, completely overthrew the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each corpse, behind every bust find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "living with drug trafficking"), which is to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were involved in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime not only makes us afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The Pain of Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video titled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear lives change") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews, on a single day.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "Priests:" "" "as every Sunday, we are preparing again today for the task we have made, to go and to look for tombs, according to the people we have loved." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we need to show not only the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and governance." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the federal state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with disease and sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">Every day I pass the newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with pictures, which can actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from experts of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as though I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug trafficker) when he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The inaction of the people is unbelievable for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were "watered."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to convince themselves that they remain spared by such tragedies when they are not agitated and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of blackmail in the Capital District: how a family was looted with threats." this describes how armed criminals pressed money from their business month for month, until they end not only destroying the business but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We will only contact you if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days whether crying would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "the journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "" "The Forgotten Kids of Ciudad Juárez: a Generation of Violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man killed by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">What is it like to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells us he had to teach himself how to cook a egg, make potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the vial with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother was gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years earlier, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody body of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez was as follows:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, as violence by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez was missing.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Council of Public Security and Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor named 3103 Morde. this corresponds to 8.5 murder per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories continue to live in the face of ever new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country in the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="819">But how is the year after something the first time has emerged? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its initial release, it has been misleading to portray tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false linking of picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank truck traversed the town of Sange in the eastern part of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded, and 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected and devastated for years. the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank truck fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Official representatives described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses, including a cinema close by, full of people who watched football world championships.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses plastered and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">"" "a picture entitled" "" "Das ist Nigeria" "". "the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident depict the horrible scenes of that day." ""</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of carbonized bodies that are lined up on the ground while individuals watch it.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story doesn't end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photograph was taken several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, and misunderstandably attributed to related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses have dramatically reported atrocities they had to flee from.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one stayed behind to count corpses," "" "said a Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The follow-up time could only be depicted with satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unexplained, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of the Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo as it was wrongly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is just one in a series of false attributions; Africa Check has documented commitments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a receipt for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments such as this example wrongly counteract the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning report published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee were beaten, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported the violence against the Rohingya, Posts showed up like the following, who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site, which in 2012 claimed to be the president of Myanmar's Than being said that monks and politicians were involved in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to report this information.</seg>

<seg id="905">This adjustment, which has been published exclusively in English, also includes references to fake images of rumors that are used by Hate Speech and are used by extremist groups to demonstrate that Muslims kill Buddhists and vice versa (which is often spread by Burmese nationalists).</seg>
<seg id="906">Russia, 2012. "falsification of a happening" (Christianophobia or political provocation?).</seg>

<seg id="909">This news page falsely claimed that the president of Myanmar Than had admitted being in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture will continue to contain it.</seg>

<seg id="912">This article from 2014 on Students, who had been killed by Boko Haram, released from the news page Análisis Digital, which has now been deleted, has expressly declared that the image does not come from the killings, but it claims that it depicts a "similar jihadist attack."</seg>

<seg id="915">The image of the DR Congo came up with this Twitterhashtag and sparked a discussion among Muslims after the Boko Haram massacre and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve greater attention to these events that allegedly took place in the name of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The image was twitched as evidence for the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times retarded), but the messages related to it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Indonesian), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message that was allegedly written by a "Father Juan Carlos Martos" about the Nigerian massacre, there were discussion forums like this one here in Vietnamese and declared it a false message.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the embassy in which the image from the DR Congo was included, the organisation of the Clarettin Missionaries and Father Juan Carlos Martos distanced themselves.</seg>

<seg id="926">In all these cases, which appeared only clearly after the original item of 2010, the picture may ultimately have a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong subjects or frames (framing) that pull these posts through. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the murders of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the assassination of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is important. therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who intentionally have a share of drinking water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atrocities are untrue and adorn the actual horror of what has actually happened in DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in great detail (see here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the withholding of images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy is to be recognized. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images of readers and viewers are desensitizing and taking the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media are acting on helping others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss with violent representations in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used in the context or in a completely missive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, each study of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. confusing) strives to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or impossible to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known today (such as the famous Portuguese Saudade) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (such as the Spanish Sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or expression does not suffice, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a bit of context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird chose to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find, for example, words from the Tap clap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - be proud of your parents in recognition of how they have been working for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - the comfort or sloth that one feels after being warmed in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They unveil other cultures, reveal other thoughts and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this site want to publish even more of these "confusing" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these little languages are.</seg>

<seg id="972">According to a statement from the Sri Lankan disaster of May 28, 2017, 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people were killed because of the floods and mud winds.</seg>
<seg id="973">Over 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and approximately 100,000 people have been transported to 304 secure residences.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rainfalls continued on Saturday (May 27), and the water levels in some areas slowly declined.</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygiene conditions of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still inaccessible areas.</seg>

<seg id="1131">Why do I tell this here at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where, however, Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars are led and people are being dramatized by creating the "other" in the public performance, four decades ago he himself was a scientist of Stanford.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being consciously and unconsciously the "other." just as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women's March, because the occupation that we have no president, the chocolate cake, while he already encapsulated countries and "to other made" people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for Narrative Art aims to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) initiative, the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices recently reported on another initiative by Steven Bird, the unmanageable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS lies not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of big cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the feasibility of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces in which people don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening to this often involves understanding" "" "these events instead" "" "listening to cherish, to feel, to start." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers present their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and presentation lead to the fact that the audience enters it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions, as the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional history from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyugara tells the fables of the rabbit and the Baboon in the language of Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the meaning of his parable, John Nyamus asked:" "" "how about speaking to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "" "with a broad smile he shares his sense of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">They listened to them!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">The events of Treasure Language storytelling have taken place in three cities so far, and the organizers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounts to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on April 3, 2017; the March started at the Mexican Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went down to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Civic front for the re-examination of the debts) and the ecumenical church meeting Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates for the reestablishment of the debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Rico call for politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debts to be held accountable for their corruption.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartoum, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and remind the contributions he has made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is held in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBass-campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the France-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director of Book Sprints, a publishing house produced by so-called 'Book Sprints', read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and is freely available here includes a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It's a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartoum, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the directory of the Adra prison, where he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book entitled "Collective Memories" gives his friends and his family a voice that calls for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has made many of us start thinking about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of partly extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred to an unknown location from the Adra prison, a non-military institution.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police Bassel had taken on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that on 12 November 2015 she was contacted by people who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them about an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototypes was more foresighted than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of many civilizations and here Greek-Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel could not know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Of course, Bassel was unable to complete this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life in dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English, even when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked. he has taught others to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He taught to other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a proof that she wrote to her husband in 2012-2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them into English from Arabic.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Book cover from Youssef Abdalki.</seg>
<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">"" "here is an excerpt from the book of Nora entitled" "" "It Happens" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the reflection at the moment in which we embrace,</seg>

<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of Bassel's imprisonment, Ghazi wrote:</seg>
<seg id="1243">A year goes by, my soul</seg>

<seg id="1247">Basle's story is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests against Bashar al-Assad's regime in 2011, more than 65,000 people have disappeared, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights).</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Until 2016, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17.723 Syrians have died in custody since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices-Community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We repeat our call today in the hope that we must do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: Director of Corruption caused by Corruption once again on previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger on a corruption case in which a member of the government returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and, together with four other defendants, was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, whose council took over Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his reappointment to the company, which happened on April 19th.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General's Office of the Republic, who evaluated the motion, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to return to his old post, as the company did not perform any disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not expect the promotion to be good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish its director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a regression regarding the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that even the company should have instituted a disciplinary procedure against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently kept silent and did not cause any appropriate legal action for the application of the appropriate functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, an important voice in the Mozambican social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as "contrary":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to prison and half of whom had been served.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish up his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has agreed to be reintegrated into the company which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Refusing to resist!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director had no moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he offended him I can't believe that you are rewarded in such a way that has already so massively insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacked the morality to return to serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead served solely on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as if it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarding.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Mahel, to remember that a thief is in jail:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to Samora Mahel prison, not only to be remembered as the first independent president for ever, but also as a sharp, intersecting and - incidentally - prophetic orator.</seg>
<seg id="1278">"" "one of his most famous oral accounts was when he vigorously confirmed that" "" "an ambitious man is capable of all, even the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest to sell." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1280">"" "an ambitious human being is at the same time criminal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions were also negative:</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or splitting basses.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network adopted their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to point to people of East Indian origin or generally use as adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or the "Kalar" word as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically provoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts where they discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for their use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with different meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair on Burmese is also written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'kalar pairs' (spaghetti), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kaldaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboody Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends in a witty way whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">"" "the sentence ku la -" "" "Healing" "" "(ku) + the question (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different." ""</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is of the opinion that she will lessen hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook needs to be more analytical before deleting all posts that were suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism won't understand what you write on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and control it by checking the related words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pairs" (splitting blower).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive quite a good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise her nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all who spread hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat proved that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to share his friends only that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new Facebook policy, I posted a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from reading, posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post "didn't correspond to the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech removed from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author expressed his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition, it seems that they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "peas curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the wrongly deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has caused a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that did not contain any hate speech, but were still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post says" "" "If you are a doctor, do you heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists, who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence, have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks is to fire violence in the communities of Myanmar, especially in Rakhine area, where conflict between Muslims and Buddhists has forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">"" "" "" "Facebook has been criticised for its failure to control the proliferating hate speech on its Burmese sides." ""</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have looked better to focus more on context than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA Copyright legislation in the USA, internationally darkened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series fight against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to use bypassing tools for blocked websites (a recent article by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third-largest VPN prevalence in the world), most usual Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has blocked articles from Wikipedia, as recently described in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet Law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">To China, Turkey is the second most popular country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to be locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System) when the platform dismantled all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (computer calculator links), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the news (via the locking of Wikipedia), we all started to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the contents in a decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia articles, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was performed independently of the Wikimedia-Foundation, and it's just about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has issued both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mad site from Wikipedia, as well as WikiLeror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors if blocked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access another URL that is not the original. that what you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server sends the request to the right Wikipedia page, making it possible to see the contents of Wikipedia, even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around himself. they were blurred with badly positioned motives and washed out colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivates him to carry a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live on the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when I suddenly called Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida lodge). he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river was a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to crackle pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to co-operate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune Nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he was to know it, for he was already face to face with tigers:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger is not disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the Budek appeared. he sat down immediately, we see ourselves and he stares me through the scarf-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">In order to promote the protection of wild animals Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and usually lived in a tent to take pictures of Otters at Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist lodgings.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was again published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid speaking with the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by the Indian state of Odisha and was expelled by her family and the village community after she had appealed to a married relative with a name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer warrants to fear, if at all which, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Wallet in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health workers and housewives, performed a unique club and were thus quickly become the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the subtleties of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, it is part of the Campaign # Khelminial, which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and campaigned for the exploitation of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working for seven years with the aid of her video camera to expose practices such as childhood marriage to exile of HIV and AIDS infected, and leads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors for change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion was women who did not call their husbands a name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open the discussion about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to speak out the name of their husbands is a custom that they are all guilty and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is regarded as a deceitful woman, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deep rooted that we have never thought about it until this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, whom her husband had never named by the name, wanted to try at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Raw ini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on by his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she all asked, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can tell us how they want it means that they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," "" "says Rohini Pawas from the village Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands." ""</seg>
<seg id="1501">Raw ini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she was only giggling in front of him; another decided to release the whole pent-up frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenaline rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided they would actually try to call their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put into the head of women: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member chose to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she got scared and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation started in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zinced red dot on the forehead that shows the marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would carry the zinced red point if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He just laughed and I stopped bearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not ceased fully with it, but they think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make an excursion at every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear anything," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last few months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their life; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never imagined before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Raw vegetables says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years now and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, such as our identities linked to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things loudly, no matter how small they seem to be.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honour and how it is related to clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only borne saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them it's okay, but some wanted to wear a salsa-curd, a wide shirt over a pants; they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much discussion and discussion about the advantages of her own choice of dress, morals connected with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own couple of Kurtas (shirts) into a discussion board so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will be able to do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion lub, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only taken small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some of them, including me, still do it, but only when they are alone and there are no other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred at all times on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult-to-navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini declares:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found beheaded and some of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently confessed that the organs of Shamans in Tanzania and Malawi are being used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There are local superstitions that the head of a bald man could reveal gold or bring wealth, the police spokesperson on Zambézia of the BBC declared.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on men-headed men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of murders for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This caused the UN 2016 to carry out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight against these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans (PRM), which also indicates that there exists a faith, according to which the victims in the head might have power generating the riches.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo by Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably just recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The fall of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer at the terminal stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion," having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Liu's case as an" "" "internal affair" "" "and a spokesman told that he deemed it" "" "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China is still receiving calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to allow him or to allow him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are fully wiped out of the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some of the reactions abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway, Norway, Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister, Erna Solberg and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Børge Brende, refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to an end after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that ultimately it has nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed last December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon rolls to China, as exports have largely been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately free Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Liu, as she announced on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">"" "" "" "we also expect China to raise all the restrictions of Mr. Lius's wife and family members." ""</seg>

<seg id="1651">United States of America</seg>
<seg id="1652">Us Ambassador Terry Branstad told us that the Americans "wish him the possibility of treatment abroad insofar as he could help him with his recovery."</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the AFP news agency on June 27 that the Embassy told the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but also to free his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The US Embassy's call came to an angry response from China, with the utterance of the State Department that "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley stated that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice, to which it claims according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1663">Canada and Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called for China to provide Liu with appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to be cared for by his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room at the hospital and that it is not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights commitments, including freedom of expression, and to release the rights blocked for the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France and France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry asked China on 29 June to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where he needs. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there will be no further information whether France will eventually accept him.</seg>

<seg id="1674">Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progress Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned with Liu on June 28th and admitted that many asked him to pray for Liu's well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08 signed for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>

<seg id="1682">License: CC0 domain public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is internationally recognised as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the single political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported Singapore to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the Cavalierio blog accused the Justice Minister attempting to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we can say that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the semblance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in the light of which he inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently run by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre of the authoritarian rulers appear again, the pretentious democrats, leave the twisted logic, because it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, during the last week of Shanmugam, the answers given to his American guests regarding our press, our judicative, our political system were really non-replies.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarnished the corresponding questions with non-reputations of rational art.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to elucidate this point, provided he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">As Anon publishes his commentary on the blog, he points out the critics concerning the fact that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is rather a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore are so unimportant even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities have been winning a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore is" "" "no country," "" "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, which makes such a polemical statement as the leader of a growing generation.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Justice Minister of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what awaits me - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes this is properly associated and aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review breaks the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr. Shanmugam commit" "" "good-faith a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian spokesman?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, which country will the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since it plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, do they defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Whom must our prime minister pay back?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink staff card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">The magazine Journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore is and has always been a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I didn't say what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have angered many Singaporeans...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band, famous in Thailand, has published a music video that paroases the junta, which in 2014 seized power and in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>

<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>

<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policy, particularly in relation to the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these recordings of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently pursued in the past three years.</seg>

<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often exploited by the authorities in order to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was established in the army which monitors online contents and prosecutes people who are accused of having slandered the monarchy.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and appears here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold colored earrings in teddy bear shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Afrika.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather they themselves) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians, who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 per night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants are coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, tells Mrs Ramírez, people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start to cry out: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some of them already slept on boxes outside.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, buying them drugs that they cannot pay, she massaging them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister hoping to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but for some Africans who are on their way to the United States, it is normal to make a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells the Haitians and Africans often travel together and that Africans are already talking about Whatsapp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker for the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mom Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "" "he answers with a smile." "" "we will always stay in touch" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her guests often send their text messages when they have gone to greet them or to report on the course of their trip.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It declares that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have contributed to preparing chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter Valenzuela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold at expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking area outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I have lived in the United States," "" "he says." "" "I have seen what they are experiencing." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people can help and others don't help others. that's why I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that in Honduras he has fled with his wife and three children in front of people who wanted to blackmail his money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked for accommodation and an unknown person, a single student, offered him a roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and tries to decide where to go the next step.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is full of guests again.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles, the passengers quietly check their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, most of them from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">MS Ramírez seems happy that her house is full but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">She looks like a proud grandmother in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughters with African hair care she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, while she puts her in front of me.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, mobile users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi held a mobile phone notification in which they instruct the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message, it is said that the app" "" "prevents access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities also used to make use of the app for more than fighting terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because, shortly after they had installed the app, they exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the news release, the police stated that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and the distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwanz's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a service service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable government actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to monitor digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China are mostly focused on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, repressed ethnic minorities such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censorship and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based media outlet "Images from mainland China" ("The Netherlands"), which censored news published in China, showed photos from a checkpoint where police checked the residents randomly as to whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are using a checkpoint with a device without this software, you could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices that are meant for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"" "" "" "images from mainland China" "" "(" "" "Deutsch" "" ") also published a Jingwang product description out of which the software can uplift the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus obtain unlimited access to the computer's hard drive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The Jingwang provisions may be a response to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimise the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, public authorities and affiliated institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber security office while operating their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities published a regulation with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">"" "" "" "the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" "" "terrorist videos" "".

<seg id="2058">"" "he catches a" "" "pleasant" conversation, despite the expressions that glide on him: "" "" my boy, you are still young, you can start as much more important with your life than to join these days and protest in demonstrations that will come to an end anyway. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I have grown accustomed to not responding.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can no longer say exactly when insults and blows have become an ordinary means of communication for me.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how that happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice within me said that I had to get used to being punished, even though I had done nothing to deserve this penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2064">In punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to pull me as much flesh as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls this affectionate "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic pipe that probably originates from the cloaks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your hangman delights in your cries.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot hold back your cries.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My screams didn't suit him enough, which is why they exchanged the pipe through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">During my first arrest, I asked myself whether the investigator had previously worked as a waste collector or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had intertwined four cables in order to show us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within one hour three of them changed, while I was still at the turn.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I heard screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The executioner noticed the cooling down and didn't like it, so he reached an electrically charged stick.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Power flowed through my entire body, enough to supply my whole district.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My half-naked body lying stretched out on the ground was the perfect conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The deafness disappeared and the pain was back again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours passed, which happened to me like minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian raptor Emslam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and opposition</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emslam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photograph was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emslam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he slides back to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, and also to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his lips adorned with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs's family to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as feloyees (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who opposed the conservative majority and questioned their well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapture.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are not only relevant in his hometown Amman, but also in cities which range from Damascus in Syria to the whole of Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by borders in his thinking, and he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the devastating effects of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even though he does not admit it openly, he has a special dislike against US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his sympathy for those trying to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as the "Palestinian refugee of the second generation." he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own circumstances," says Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I am a human being" "", "while he pours in water dissolved nescafé into two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Apparently, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a burning hot June day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the slats speak lukewarm coffee and the swaths of the Kent-cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when you take a look at the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - to not land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, Jordan's Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic campaign - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front-singer Hamed Sinnai, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert agreement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">In an interview with CNN, the deputies and former Press spokesperson in the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said that the concert "just" was cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the band's engagement in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights" who continue to advocate for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be simply a rhetoric, but actually reflecting a reality that is becoming more and more evident in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib regained traditional gender norms by incorporating his vision of the fate of Arab women who had premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unidentified unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years, the number of 'honorary murders' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch the number of honourable killings in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support the women victims of attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a 1954 ban on crime, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be imprisoned for indefinite time in prison," and for their release, many years of bureaucratic expenditures and the guarantee on the part of the family are necessary for the woman to take nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from topics that have long been considered taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot be separated from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come out of the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "politics was fed me," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib attacks the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse often repeats itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one, in his words, "can get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gays and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to see later that his comments were torn out, twisted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed only a edited version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is openly campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance towards homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nueva, a poets of the eighth century, who still remains in memory even today thanks to his homogenous erotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib wonders: if Abu Nuevo, who later should work on behalf of the caliphs, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou's Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the Hashemite kingdom, it is nothing new that the government sanction attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service held several former members of the Government and members of the teacher's association with the reasoning that they had critically voiced concern about the problems associated with the corruption that has been deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a continuous giving and taking. Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - this is how Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, like millions of other Arabs, Hdaib dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of" "" "experiencing them" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificially led democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is ready, Hdaib will continue to escalate and consequently resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belongs as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One supposes that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many regions of Tohokus. another theory states that the feasts, drums and dancing came over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west of Japan came to the Northeast to force the indigenous people of the region, the emissi, to their knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint venture in the capital, Meguro Gajen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking forward to the Meguro Gaelen for a long time: two fixed cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a stunning way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebuchaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of an 18 metre high wastage was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Outer appearances and body care were rare as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hairdresser's.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street noise and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Brazil), has led to more and more normal citizens going into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can reproduce these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts compete against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos about current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Education facilities such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in hair art instead of bad advice that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported on some of its successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only college in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because we have built up this educational community for love with the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letters of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the contribution" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "" "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important, people who feel ejected to receive affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This was exactly the question of the young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga of BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (letters for reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government signed a peace agreement with the FARC guerrilla movement, which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the Peace Treaty was so significant that Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But before the Colombians, there is still a long way to speak about a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who lived in illegal refugee camps for many years, had been exposed to war rhetoric and carried their weapons around the clock, must now re-integrate themselves into the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, who had grown accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now incorporate them into their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Columbians must unite and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter who will then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation was born at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people this year, who needed most urgently.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The idea was to write letters full of hope and support for former Fifa fighters who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make discourse of a war story into a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2,000 letters have been collected within the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 Letters were handed over to one of the UN refugee camps in the Caldono Cauca region on March 19.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo von der Stiftung Bogoteine travelled to the camp to transfer the letters in person.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members presented themselves as they had done earlier in order to receive the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between," told the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, one of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go, because next to him lay a MGL-garnet, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I spoke to him anyway and asked," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he said," "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "" "" "I have never written anything such a nice thing in my life, that's why I answer it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him very tightly, and put me beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this warrior, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before starvation. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I just learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices and voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the beginning, students and some of the FARC leaders came together for a discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, its ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice by the State has exerted on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party, we can help shape society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this magnitude, it is worth overcoming all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who have never heard their ears and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I've often seen as monsters and even hate me, are only people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">For example, Gustavo González, commander of the camp at Caldono-Cauca, wrote the following letter to Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of Cali.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was made to know that after the disarmament peace would prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people ready to seize the weapons, rise and protest for their rights." "" "and that is also totally justified (...)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now focus on peace, on a policy without arms.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and sacrifice, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs like a Damoklesschwert over the local LGBTQ community has not been created overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Several months ago, the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya conquered international headlines after reports have been published that dealt with the dragging, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who captured suspicious men and put them into secret prisons in gun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a Transwoman, was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since childhood she sensed that she was actually a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she grew up she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechens had experienced the gender equality of their landlady, the hunt was opened on Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">Out of fear for her life she moved to the USA in the end.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a Transwoman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone I thought he was a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them all over the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no men in Chechnya that can remove this shame?"</seg>

<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two stab wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which hospitals have you been laid - in which the men or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are deprecated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me up to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful of me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February, I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya to prove that all this was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They put absurd demands: some said to me that I had to prove it by running up without the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Grozny and say that I hadn't changed my gender that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They brought a monster to the world, which has corrupted not only your family but the whole republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she took a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window was a car with dark windows and a number plate with a 95 on it.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was a bit lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help, I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to invoke my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registering with me, without knowing anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" "" "you don't think you're safe, just because you left the country?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are stuck. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">We don't talk about gender equality, this is a taboo theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really take pains to look like the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have remained dormant?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him, I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has sat in gun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He said that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock up a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this I mean, they probably invite relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" has been experienced by blood.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still held in these mysteries?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there weren't so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to stand up to Kadyrov's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be held there so that they can present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say:" "" "should they be killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they had attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, they were deliberately immersed in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in Argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person himself was there when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, there have been no reports yet. however, we suspect such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003 I was already known in Grozny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was applied, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "originally Russia wanted to introduce us to the" "" "Civilization" "", "but ultimately gave us back to the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had tinted eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never just curbed me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "mock is not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me, never hunted and never struck.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could sense how people in town started to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who smiled and laughed at first looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the meantime I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic deteriorated steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity are you going to work now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacups, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for that.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people by themselves when I clapped breeding places.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">This is the nature that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens, who wish to make you white with foam in front of the mouth that there are no wailing for them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestanes have which, the cabardines, which, the Russians have also which; on the whole planet, they exist - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think of merchiness on men who love men, and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling, to be precise, different attitudes towards life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know I'm myself now.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn of an increase in suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahrazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahraz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">There has been a strong increase in suicide since the last few months.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patriotic Democratic Movement in Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-incineration of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 pushed the desperate situation of the Arab Ahrazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahraz in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahrazi's human rights groups who want to work in Ahraz and want to remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could no longer do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahrazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take their lives.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahrazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shaha Bani Tamim - have imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who were helpless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe job because of the persecution of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahrazi suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab Ahrazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahraz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and, in 1925, undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahraz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the richest and most valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of ill-treated diseases, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically denies the Ahrazi Arabs jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of dams, the water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are surrounding.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused in the region by drought, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi participants increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, Iranian general director of cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahrazis who are looking for a job completed primary school, 55% completed secondary school and 45% have university degrees.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahmad human rights activist, residing in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young Ahrazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians coming from Ahraz and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functionaries and institutions do not pretend to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahrazi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at annihilating the spirit of the national resistance of young Arabs and compelling them to earn their living outside their home country of Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their affiliation with the Ahrazi and to be employed, since even Arab names at the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahrazi have to endure, human rights activists suggest alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is preventable.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement authored by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website of Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves as intersectional feminists - react with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay out well-thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me, why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be female.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, despite the same education women still earn less money than men nowadays.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later encounter a glass ceiling in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and faiths.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is known and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of this and I suffer doubly and triple of it.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to skin color, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I speak of how we have always been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists decide to keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, all agree that women - all women - should come together in order to "lift up their voices and" Kumbaya, my Lord "to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about the fact that there is an additional institutionalized form of racist-motivated violence in addition to sexualised violence, which we are exposed to black women in a twofold manner.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, men and all men of all skin color to have the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands who refuses to consider injustices in her thinking, which relate to both sex and skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "journeyman complained in her speech in 1851:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to uphold an ideology in which the black woman in an historical sense is a dishonest and marginalized being." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation to advance their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping of skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to teach them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women from different backgrounds a home and isolate themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" still exists in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and join the movement of the Womanism created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of applying for a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we black women define us according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana possibly: claims. (about: Africa-Womanismus: as we recapture ourselves) speaks of how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can in this way also create spaces where the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which constitute the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can raise black women and women from other cultures, as in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Because of my dark skin and because of my being as a woman, I am recognized as a part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can blossom in an environment in which my life has neither passed, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2469">Again and again Nabil Musa travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years - mostly with surfboard or canoe - with a particular concern by the Kurdistan area in Iraq. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"" "" "" "I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child," "" "said Musa." ""</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence against Women in Paraguay" by cursory. the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# soft-catchy) reporting about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner who had been violent against her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena for mistreatment, the well-known display of Ada Báez did not use anything.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second wife withdraws her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">When women make an announcement at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit being victims of violence should report to law enforcement agencies at all.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Inhalt1 Strikes and statistics 2 Invisible abuse and a judicial system that no undervolt3 Paraguays laws: good approach, inadequate conversion impacts and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are really abused, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudio, a social science research institution in Paraguay. "there are various statements and reports which, however, do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available figures, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 ads were reported to the District Attorney General for domestic violence. 70% of them were about violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the courts of peace. 86% of the ads of women came here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the adverts 40% of women reported that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics however do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>

<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non-Less) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law stipulates that Feminid should be declared an independent criminal offense and punish the harder as it is already the case in neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the wording of the law was changed in a number of points, so as to convince the members of the law which feared that the way for the decriminalisation of abortions is prohibited, which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and be punished with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill was intended to cover most of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs which the victims of violence must bear on their own, if they simply want to refund sums and receive a secure accommodation to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">A rethink must take place here, so that violence can no longer be regarded as something normal.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his approval</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media. this is a growing area addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research to be carried out on site: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines are missing in the offer of global health care, which cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have a far greater impact in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the pharma companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research carried out by African scientists will help build up their own research capacities in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Research on Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a post-doc at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched the HIV virus himself before deciding to go back home to support the Serbian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warner discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings in the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warner speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the sambian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I am currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>

<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no fundamental research here. we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always remain beneficiaries instead of being doers themselves.</seg>

<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here, because funding and opportunities for development are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">CC: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">CC: what is the opinion of the general public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">CC: what is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it concentrate on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I saw great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The social sciences, computer science, big data, exploration of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa in comparison to Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: it is often the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">"" "the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment (the so-called" "" "paywall" "" ") also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research." ""</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the United States to India: how "open source" seed producers change world food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine dealing with solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton bred a salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 varieties, such as Outreddit, the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many types of salads he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only applied to individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or curled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or carrots. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">Morton is still fond of lettuce as a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, but it now takes longer because his work is more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if a boulder in a river is lying around which I have to dwindle." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "we have to do this now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far on salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And when they stand trial, no one can breed a new type of salad because all the characteristics are already patented. "he continues to do as much as possible and tries to breed those characteristics that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very cautious and endeavours to use no material protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the United States and around the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>

<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"" "the Open Source Seed Initiative (" "" "Open Source" "" "initiative) is inspired by the movement for free" "" "open source" "" "software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software." ""</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was created in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are therefore permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, shortly named Ossi, US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds raised by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open Source" breeders only allow others who buy their seeds, cross it to breed their own varieties, and not immediately exclude them - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emerized professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of the seed and the ability to grow new plants is important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to seed, seed plays a role in larger groups such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg emphasises that the" "" "open-source" "" "movement does not deal with genetically modified plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seeds," says he and takes on the increasingly common mergers of ChemChina and Syngenta and Bayer, which are offered in August and September 2016. "anyone who wants to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables should also know that the manner in which this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative join forces to keep their seed freely available to others. in contrast, their approach is in contrast to patenting seeds and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore increasingly restricted.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive director of Ossi, worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all the carrots is protected as intellectual property, which makes it usable for plant breeders either at all or only difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are no such estimates for other plants yet, but experts like Luby suggest that massive cultivated plants such as wheat are patented in more scale than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they are specifically desired characteristics - from those through which their taste or colour is improved to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and resist threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing through more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto recognises that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It contradicts, however, that intellectual property holds other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant variations" promote innovation. "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibit innovations, but encourages them by making more material and know-how available to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this different: waiting for 20 years until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and continue to remain: "independent plant breeders do not have the time or money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it is impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">Overall, Morton is interfering with the concept of patenting plant characteristics: "we don't really create the features ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants themselves form it themselves and as a breeder we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US State Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "if you breed a variety, you also breed its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures are needed for their cultivation of massive herbicides, which breeds into its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is very opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as moving on international markets but smaller than Monsanto) have patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads at his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding crop patents: "it looks like I am more than a company with my efforts to produce something new.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalog, as I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years, "he says." with a patent one is protected against competition for 20 years, which makes it very easy in my opinion. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is a "open source" seed program. to preserve the seed of traditional crops, the Centre works with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "it also supports them to come to" "" "open source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organisation Agrecol is working on an open-source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding differ from country to country, so the Ossi obligation cannot be easily taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally cultivated plants should not be patentable. this refers to the current practice of the European Patent Office that allows patents on conventionally cultivated plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">One explanation, however, is not a law; now it is up to the member states' governments to bring the patent office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from across East Africa came together to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend to patenting seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' Program for Open Source Seed Systems, declares that the organization is currently building a global alliance for "open source" seed systems for the planned launch of the official start-up next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A combination of environmental protection and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organization USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, technology and concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food - has published a summary of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - a report in which it believes that farmers must have the opportunity to participate in seeds, to exchange it and to help shape the seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The report also highlights the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that hopes that Luby von Ossi hopes that more people will soon see him.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of the Censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock the content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it was the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of the 5th of August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critically criticized this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains committed to defending freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world in spite of this attack and the mockery of the Egyptian right and the constitution. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these aims, it was never as important as now. ANHRI confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome and not to give up. we insist on fulfilling our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, for example the independent news site Mada Masr, Arab-language edition of Huffington Post and the Qatar-based Al Jazeera network because of alleged "support for terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organization of wave of web site closures to the victim. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZMOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Apart from ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada also has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles, which he writes not to accessible websites and media for Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government was the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider in which also Canada's blog is located, on the other hand, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, reporting on the student protests and recorded a video on how the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the government's lock and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even though the blogging of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) I succeeded in giving me the feeling of a state of siege; a arrest, attempted murder, invitation to the National Security Council, blocked blogs, and any other web page I worked for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write for nothing. in other words: my words have influence, even if only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post items to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave ones walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and ETISALAT.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blockage of vendors, where Internet censorship and private surfing were possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blockage of websites offering VPNs started.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice suggests the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users could have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In addition, the situation is worsened by the fact that the decision-making decisions are taken behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with which it can proceed to court against these acts.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to censorship and whom will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army in the Favelas in Niterói, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in the whole of Brazil are reporting with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot at school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is killed," "Thieves robbing pharmacy with military weapons," "President Timer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and airship to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the 2017 violence threshold in Rio achieved the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian Non-Governmental Organisation of Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "published in Rio for detailed reporting on violence in Rio was published in the editorial" "" "This is not normal" "" "in which she announced a new section called" "" "war in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explains the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city in the world, such as murder, robbery, sex crimes, etc. all that happens in the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to cry out: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">"" "" "" "extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war break in a country that doesn't recognise the war." ""</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a newspaper journalist explains that according to the Institute of Inner Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police which only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it uses?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence is a "war." this is in her opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to be held accountable by the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">To remember: the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">According to Cecília, "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie in the north and northeast of the country according to the statistics of 2015. these are the most up-to-date data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "when we look at the Mordrates per federal state, Rio is ranked 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">The Globo company, the largest media company in South America, has recently underlined the importance of the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">One of these security policy measures also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit appointed by Rio in 2003, whose goal is to capture a Favela by deploying a massive police custody and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths. however, after several years, the UPP has been increasingly under attack after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also entails serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this requires the state to use means and ways typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for "collateral damage" and "strained bullets."</seg>
<seg id="2787">The fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio are still suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week ago, the police cleared the mountain with the Favela Jacarzinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: an orphaned died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal sieges and blockades, chiefly through the Assad regime facing loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to the Siege Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace Organisation PAX and the Syria Institute research institute, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib are currently around a million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region east Ghouta, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume, based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege, which led to the fact that local inhabitants are dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Due to the longlasting blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian assistants and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own fungi as a "life saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alintervenda and carry out the project jointly with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the common foods cultivated in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Directly of the project, Abo Nabil, spoke to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we chose cultivation of mushrooms, because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and basements." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2814">In order to raise funds for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowd funding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghira Alnida.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to give 125 families knowledge about the planting of mushrooms, such as Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached more than 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 €, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo until Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators holding the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the shortage of fuel, locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they started the" "" "production of mushrooms originating from regions" "" "before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many district capitals in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires raging in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the government proclaimed a state of state last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Brandies were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 dead.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire breakouts spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occured in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite imagery, some 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is only in 4 districts no fire.</seg>

<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was not able to curb the magnitude of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveral from the Federation of Farmers of Portugal declared the newspaper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After Pedrógão streets and villages were evacuated for anything and nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did not do this anywhere: there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">"" "in the forest of Leiria, a similar tragedy would have happened as in June, as the streets were closed very late." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2851">In addition, building permits are questioned in locations with high fire risk.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far-reaching proposal on the form of forests, which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the communes who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a slackening of the law which allowed the construction activity case to fall if the applicant had funds for self-defence - that was an open backdoor, so everything could be built," João Sorval continues in the same article of the newspaper Público.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organisation Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of easily combustible wood, like in a vicious circle, spread further and further according to fires of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when residents were looking for information or tried to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: they used their own civil protection data with the help of the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial in this fateful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the onslaught of 400,000 users who watched the fires: the site counted more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the party Hezb-e-Wahdat, who was dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt defenceless.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came ever closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran. once again, he found himself in a foreign land along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars that were heavier than himself to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really hard," "" "said Ashark in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site, where we worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">"" "there were no services and no heating there. we hung nylon in front of the open windows, so that we didn't freeze at night." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf had left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After rejecting his application for asylum in Greece, Asharaf moved to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church, which distributed food to the needy two times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high twin quotas. however, it is also true that the conditions applying to asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organisation" "" "Civil Liberties Union for Europe" "" "writes that the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in more than 3000 "special reception centres." these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to an admission centre if they have formally requested an application for asylum - which may result in months after the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation, either depend on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">That's how it was called Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his boundless lifestyles helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having worked for several years in the construction industry, Asharaf put all his savings into the creation of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now subject to the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film won the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some Afghans run business, including tailoring, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his Orient Experience restaurant, where the waiters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant Peace & amp in Padua; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome also stand in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs goals reach far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers and aim to return to the country that he had to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also opportunities," says Ashark with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as everyone else. "</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharaf also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques. "so they can sell their crop surpluses in the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but at the end there are stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported on the clearing of the camp Raba'a el Adavya in Cairo, protesting against the removal of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Photo by @ Ciluna27 on Twitter shared.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen Report is an international snapshot showing challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that stipulates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">In order to be able to use social networks, users must register within six months of successful legislative decision on the authority's website stating their full name and identity number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who failed to take this step could be sentenced to a sentence of up to six months or the end of a sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was applied by sixty parliamentarians, is currently on the right hand to the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "in May another member of Parliament filed a legislative proposal in which harder punishments would be introduced to insult the president or a senior official." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under Egyptian law, the insult of the President as well as government institutions is already punishable. however, under the legislative proposal, such a crime would be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts of Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "" "" "should the law be passed, this can mean up to three years" "" "imprisonment for convicted." ""</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger already for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who captured Egyptian police officers while demonstrating violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan was expecting more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested during the same incident four years in prison for a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to the 20th May because the prison management of the human rights groups failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan also threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree that the apparent burden of inter alia weapons collection, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza acquitted two journalists, Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their coverage of pro-morsi bean blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the penalties of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the aforementioned case, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists are interrogated to skillful documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours hearing Sami Ben Gharbia, who is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat as well as the Global Voices advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was mainly interrogated by the President of the Republic, which according to the plan explicitly endorsed a controversial draft law, which would assure business people and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption accused of withholding all illegally received funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on April 21, on Nawaat's website, sheds light on how the Presidential plans look for the support of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia loaned the attribution of his sources by specifying Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which authorizes journalists to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared in the case of a witness in the district court in Tunis on 9 May.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new rules of the Information Office of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share news in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the rules that registering with full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suggest that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks. until now, it is unclear how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these rules only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Let's see then in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register as the" "" "organizer of the dissemination of information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 law, thanks to which the Russian Government conducts a list of online services that organise the "publication of the information." the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for the removal of content and to force it on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These web pages currently include websites such as Vkontakte and Odnobyniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court decrees Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the Wikipedias locking in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English-language articles, the information that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "the Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site was blocked because it was" "" "a source of information that co-operates with groups in order to create a political diffusion campaign against Turkey." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked the website. it is thus, besides, China, one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Britain cannot stop snuffling</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week's leaked documents, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation regarding increased surveillance powers, which would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install malware programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outwardly.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In spite of all this, the consultation will continue until May 19. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
