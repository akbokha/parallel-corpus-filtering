that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before someone heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that N@@ SA illeg@@ ally listened to phones from Americans .
but it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA literally gave Iran a blu@@ ep@@ r@@ int for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not like at all ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has comp@@ eted against Ris@@ en and urged him to call his alleged sources .
in this move he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many cour@@ ageous repor@@ ters had already done before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 Ris@@ en was thus at risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , although for years they have stated that it would be essential for their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped to tears . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ters and sources can hide less and less .
instead of failure and spl@@ itting to make statements , it could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have secretly procu@@ red his telephone calls ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his credit return , and even travel tips with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey sterling , a CIA W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s alleged source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments before him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional order because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on all .
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press may use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed , they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today , there is communication software , which didn &apos;t exist yet , as ris@@ er had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
one such technology is Secure@@ Code , an open source distribution system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the relevant news agency has access .
so the government cannot provide more information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
but Secure@@ Code is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to weigh mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot; &quot; &quot;
who wants to report about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and report about over@@ crowded hospitals . or the nearest environmental worker who sheds light on the contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a wall street insi@@ ders , warning us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 the greatest data leak in history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; enormous sums of money are hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for a statement . &#93; This week we were sent by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ ig@@ ned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is said that a trace of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait nervous for the next release , and on the next un@@ veiled documents .
now that sounds like the P@@ lot of an agent maker or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should this be done ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
in the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by a few to hide and obsc@@ ure their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these signs .
it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters .
I also find it interesting that there are less reports in the USA on this matter .
presumably because there have been no prominent Americans in these revelations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by the principle behind these tax ha@@ v@@ ens , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a leak@@ age of the Cay@@ man Islands or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , in some US states there is less information needed to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card .
this type of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed frau@@ d@@ sters to rip off particularly vulnerable off@@ springs .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked that all up to one lawyer made suggestions to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it &apos;s not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and in order to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of conduct ag@@ grav@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that may sound very sen@@ sel@@ ess as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I see that some things have started to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few years , we have seen an increase in transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU registers in central registers on a national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it .
one of the most unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have proposed a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally .
for us with Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who will get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bo@@ g@@ us companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need managers in the economy to stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this type of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the transparency that now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story of how I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip all over the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was getting late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what am I doing now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I rock in there ?
a stranger sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , sne@@ aked at to@@ e tips to the door , and shut my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he had bought depends on his class room . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
maybe the people who were sold strangers to me in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
it was normal for me to accommodate people on my air mattress . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a leap of time , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate is pulling out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something about it . our apartment is becoming a designer &apos;s bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , including Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , plus a mattress and morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we created a website and created so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ets ta@@ sted completely different because we made it for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed at us .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things were rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ erg@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept .
so we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when you visit .
over the Internet they can invite wild people to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited for the mis@@ sile to ign@@ ite .
but they did not .
no one who is still in sol@@ ace would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we have learned that strangers are dangerous .
if one has a problem , one is contempl@@ ating the things that one can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design afford such things ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we have been striving for .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I &apos;d like to unlock your mobile phone .
share your locked mobile phone with your left sitting area .
this silent flight of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile of a stranger in his hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
so also most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just like this , who actually has Al Gor@@ es cell phone now ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is chann@@ eling for the president &apos;s office ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you some of the discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name ; if he tells you where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you would have 150 evaluations , all of which say : &quot; he can really cling to very well @-@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because a well @-@ thought out feedback system strengthens trust . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to surrender negative jud@@ gements .
ultimately we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had submitted their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study together with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are in terms of age and residence .
little by surprise , we entr@@ ust the most to the people who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting if you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by assessments .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if one has more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation stems from common ground .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you get no response . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one tells too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great works of art in your home ! I make holidays with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
all our company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not expect was the large amount of people who were more than willing to reject those prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbelievable good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a need not covered before .
for us , the business is running very well .
of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or devast@@ ate apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front , when trust was broken .
there &apos;s nothing worse than these calls . it &apos;s hur@@ ting when I just think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that one hears in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem .
for men trusted one another .
when confidence works , something wonderful can arise .
one of our guests made vac@@ ations in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save life even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they pass books .
you can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay is running .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing fit together with money transactions ?
this is an economical trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not just for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; le@@ asing industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to name , the thing will not do justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people are part of themselves , and that will change everything .
when you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place one visits , a group of Ans@@ wers would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub craw@@ our neighborhood of which one has never heard of ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
today apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground up for sharing ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of sharing ?
I imagine cities that enable us to build society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces belonging to the government ,
were now offered to residents . students who were looking for a place to stay
were taught to people whose children were exp@@ elled . incu@@ b@@ ator programs were started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be guest in a stranger or even host .
so the idea seems not to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was also hospitality before .
there were similar sites in front of us .
so why did our work just work ?
apart from Happ@@ iness and Tim@@ ing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I think it &apos;s amazing ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
of course , we know that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for design in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people that look like me .
a study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think most of them do not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk with their U@@ ber riders .
for those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mo@@ ench@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga singing , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born that way .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ ch .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you afflic@@ t yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : back then it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence for me , and with the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt me to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and finally believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was a tru@@ sting and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone you perceive , completely understands you , and still loves you ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking news &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew into buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock quickly turned into rebellion .
why should we do something like this ?
&quot; &quot; ... &quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Middle descent ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
it was not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others transformed me from a ci@@ vic into a susp@@ ects .
the same day we had to travel through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and begin the post@@ graduate course .
I remember how I drove myself -- as deep as we drove into my seat , and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and when I heard , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be alert , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful not &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in@@ doors all week .
then it was Friday this week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings came out : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who were held for Muslims .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the people who attacked this country attacked our country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have pushed the anger of the people to the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain yourself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the accus@@ ations that are hard . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when will we get rid of them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
the question is : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less , because the question is mis@@ placed .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the US body , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
it might take a few parking spaces but do not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to view people of other fai@@ ths more toler@@ ant , and to show greater ci@@ vic participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told me : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
during the radic@@ alization process one has noticed that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the extrem@@ ist group can do a bra@@ in@@ washing , which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or fallen away from faith .
when we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop people going to the mos@@ que .
some still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add ourselves to their imag@@ inations when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim that their ideology is based on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when you look at them , they do not drive what they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; read &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that makes them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she wanted to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every minister with whom she had spoken brings her to silence and told her that her wrath , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing , and something that gave meaning to their anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts that promised her a solution .
this Ima@@ m re@@ established the connection with God and their church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive way for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consum@@ tion of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- show that if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian system of governance , conformity and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that when people submit messages in which neg@@ atively about Muslims have been reported , they rather vo@@ iced military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just a academic problem .
if you look at when the mood against Muslims swe@@ pt upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to hollow out the fund@@ ament of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
the assignment of collective inno@@ c@@ ence is not just about having to explain oneself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young couple , married in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was at the Faculty of D@@ enti@@ stry , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did such a young man come out of my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting her in the afternoon .
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be fatal , not only im@@ moral , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we would like to give to our children : one thing that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely practise our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we ro@@ de in silence , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took it out , pulled out my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , for half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to help us .
at this moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had preferred the courage and compassion of panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who may claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a ment@@ or with a drau@@ ght , working in a noble thought factory , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fo@@ ol@@ ed . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as allowed .
when one looks at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest study of Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m not an exception in any way .
when people appear as an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about becoming a billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions around the world .
before air @-@ pack@@ ets entered our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France had built a six @-@ meter high tower of 1,@@ 500 bricks in front of the audience . some years ago they started flying with ropes .
connected to each other , air devices reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces .
you can also build resili@@ ent structures automatically .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to laws of nature .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must be collective knowing where the mobile objects are in space .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects , which enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ shoot of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flying machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands can be executed at the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear @-@ star@@ ters ,
a flight device trying to hit two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can ho@@ ver , and therefore has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the flight device doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practi@@ sing .
okay . okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that penetrate the core of the matter .
such a question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of mobile parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known around as machines with a thousand mo@@ ve@@ able parts that come together to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft , which only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanically most remote controlled aircraft . it was invented recently .
it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse th@@ ru@@ sters , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is quite simple , there is a lot happening inside the interior , so that it can fly stable and can move anywhere in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear star@@ ters . to kill it , I have to throw it right .
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of throwing it right when I see all is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the coach with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is symmet@@ ric .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his direction .
thus he receives the extraordinary ability ,
moving in the room in all directions , no matter in which direction it is turned or even rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some things can be imagined in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let us see that .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely secure and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate twin prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when assembling them , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller comes out , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , if restricted .
we will demonstrate this by f@@ row@@ ning one half .
the last demonstration examines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took standard micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ters -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ ps them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where it is in space and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully you will motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to re@@ think new revolutionary ideas .
the especially safe machine there would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for guys like us the wages lie in the development and creative act .
it serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
more than 1,3 billion years ago , two black holes were cir@@ cling to each other in a very distant gal@@ axy . they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth second into pure energy .
for this short moment they sh@@ ined bri@@ ghter than all the stars in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the whole known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy into the form of light --
we finally talk of black holes .
the whole energy was released into the space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded into gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let &apos;s arrange the events in a temporal fashion .
more than 1,3 billion years ago , there had just been several zel@@ liges lives on Earth .
since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is at home -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago a group decided particularly cour@@ ageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- to build a huge laser detector to search for gravit@@ ational waves , which might originate through colli@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized it as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector lig@@ o : the Laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ ometer @-@ Radi@@ ation @-@ Observ@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which improved the recognition performance enormously .
therefore , one calls it Advanced Lig@@ o now .
in early September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to solve some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , just a few days after the detection of the detector , the gravit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes were scre@@ wing through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of My Dau@@ ghter
and the f@@ arewell from my sick father .
in essence , they were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gravit@@ ational waves of black holes for 23 years and their observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gravit@@ ational waves ?
a gravit@@ ational wave is a cra@@ ck@@ ling in the fabric of space and time .
when the shaft is over@@ hau@@ led , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and squee@@ zed into the other .
for illustration , lec@@ turers in courses of rel@@ ativity often lead to a really sil@@ ly dance .
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gravit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ owed by us during the arrival of the waves . the el@@ on@@ gation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . that &apos;s why the lig@@ o staff were crazy for them .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured precisely to less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravity
Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by seeing the light coming from several points around you .
it &apos;s different with sounds .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible , to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
your child &apos;s face for example .
instead , we listen to certain properties , such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to listen to the story behind it .
&quot; now I am talking about Alice . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; du@@ n Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies lie in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
the gravity to listen can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just circular : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same pair of chir@@ ping with an additional key change . that sounds so : wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14th 2015 -- a date which I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; sur@@ ren@@ des noise &#93; Som@@ e@@ one knows what he needs to hear , this is seen as the sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate as quickly as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let us briefly consider what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve one hundred times a second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we heard it .
therein lies the lasting meaning of lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o is pav@@ ing a whole new way to explore the universe , as it has never been possible before .
on this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space we can -- practically or fundamentally -- not see .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ ghty stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we learned a great deal about the universe .
the exciting physical processes occur in the nucle@@ us , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through because these are op@@ a@@ que .
gravit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the cosmos , but we will never see them since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own after@@ glow .
with the help of gravit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and probably the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that there are all things we have never seen before , which we will never see and of which we have no idea of . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , in the first run , Lig@@ o found things we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , like Lig@@ o it ob@@ serves , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are the dust bones for our archaeological work so to speak .
Lig@@ o offers us a completely different view of the events in space , the creation of the stars and ultimately how we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great detectors and listen to the sounds and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start the show ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of , my fear eliminated .
my fear to keep talking , my social fear -- ph@@ ew , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a definite yes that pro@@ found@@ ly changed my life to an unexpected kind . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the least , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pussy , I need milk for my bill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude towards life in my family . from then on I am bo@@ thered to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an amazing side @-@ effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say to play with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am the author . I think of things , awaken you to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
I make television , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs which did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programs simultaneously in production , four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run succ@@ essively on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series in 256 regions in 67 languages run for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are programs that I have created myself and not only produced , so still above . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who is doing it ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you so all of you who work so hard whether you are now managing a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously if I &apos;m talking about work so you can understand that I &apos;m not just sitting on the computer and fanta@@ sizing , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not about dreams in a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am immersed in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I ordered troops to paint on a canvas .
as if you wear a high sound , deliver a marathon .
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy road , I could drive on it forever .
many people assume , when I declare to them the tot@@ als that I talk about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t get me wrong , it does .
but the tot@@ als -- when I started to work and work and work , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy . the bu@@ zz !
the sum is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the voice is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you cannot strive other than by size .
the feeling of not being able to be different than striving for size doesn &apos;t matter at what price .
this is called the sum .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it &apos;s called genius .
perhaps it &apos;s called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I &apos;m not a failure , and I just know that I love sum@@ ming .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more bound limits , the more work there are , the more things are happening , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to succeed , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land which I created , the marathon which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the tot@@ als , the tot@@ als , the tot@@ als .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the bu@@ zz . I &apos;m the bu@@ zz .
am I only this bu@@ zz ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
over@@ worked , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the bu@@ zz stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m won &apos;t be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; She@@ ets , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the tot@@ als ceased .
the bu@@ zz of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was out .
the tot@@ als did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , worked weekends , no regre@@ ts , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan does not sleep , does not sleep , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no tot@@ um .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was an ad Titan ,
everything was grey , I just didn &apos;t have any fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the tot@@ als I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Make ha@@ ste , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re working , you love what you &apos;re doing , being a teacher , a mo@@ m , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love someone else , and that &apos;s how the bu@@ zz feels when you already knew the bu@@ zz when the bu@@ zz is stopped , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things become aware of me :
first , I have to say yes to all and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t call anyone any more &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when did that happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m a titanium and smo@@ ther my hum@@ ming , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of hum@@ ming , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land I create , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky finger and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl is releasing in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I &apos;m happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost is coming in .
and not immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is coming back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the tot@@ als , but a bu@@ zz@@ ing .
and now I feel like I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stick to the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz , the titanium dioxide , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am when I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and TV @-@ hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real money is .
bu@@ zz is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is the stream that comes from the lust of life .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real tot@@ als ignore the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the true hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , for which God told me that I am a titanium ?
it &apos;s just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule so that I can rid myself of any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is Law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the hum@@ ming again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not seem@@ ing to me as they work .
the truth is hur@@ ting ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace than at home .
this conc@@ ession is painful , for what kind of man does he prefer to be at home ?
well yes , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed is not one of them .
we are racing around in the garden , back and forth , back and forth .
we make small dancing parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst pipe bubbles .
at the same time I feel stiff@@ ly , absent and confused .
I always grab my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also say it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you think me na@@ ï@@ ve for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you probably are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or cookie replaces me .
and when my teen@@ age daughter speaks with me for 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more need not .
everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children get ready .
but 15 minutes are included !
my children are my oasis of well @-@ being , my world . they don &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for his peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m going to fail and I win . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands for all I have given up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training , when I wanted to out@@ do myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece , why not treat yourself full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the tot@@ als came back in my spare time . the tot@@ als seem to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends .
this is my sum .
the bu@@ zz of life .
the bu@@ zz of love .
the bu@@ zz of work is part of me , but only a part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that .
it is sn@@ u@@ ff@@ led to me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan who plays a trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the land I create , the marathon that I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the tot@@ als , the tot@@ als , the other , the right tot@@ als : the tot@@ als of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , abi@@ ding , naked and new attitude towards life is spreading within me . less titanium -- more I !
the more I feel exactly that bu@@ zz , the more I know who I am .
I am the author . I think of things , I catch you to life .
that is part of the job , which means living a dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to deal with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low self @-@ healing ability .
after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures .
they certainly have heard of one of the best known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one im@@ planted a electrode deep in the brain to influence neur@@ ons &quot; circuits in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s who suffered from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that at skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas the brain is s@@ wollen and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
to save lives , you have to reduce the pressure of cran@@ ial pressure .
for this you sometimes have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to let cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed to do so .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
this was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it looked just like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from the biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they were disper@@ sed slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fo@@ etus , they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain because we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so sure .
one thing is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them in color to be able to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we re @-@ inv@@ aded it at the point of departure of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re @-@ plan these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ plan the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ ters we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario , we reim@@ plant@@ ated the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury and reim@@ plant@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ planted .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture .
of course we couldn &apos;t stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain damage ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
when they had reached a stable skill level , we moved the motor @-@ motor area in the motor cor@@ tex .
ther@@ eu@@ pon the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore .
exactly as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously re@@ covering up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic cereb@@ ral mechanisms . they recover to some degree , just like the monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left you see the monkey , who recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before the injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we reim@@ plant@@ ated the cells : the same monkey , two months after implantation .
I can tell you that these were very exciting results for us as well .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream still is to implant her in human beings .
I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giuss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results one has to fill about two kilograms of paper and forms in order to pass through this type of studies .
BG : that &apos;s understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate if it is useful to make this type of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multic@@ enter study .
first you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable sentim@@ ents .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- as finance minister in the Euro@@ group , I was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally made clear that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at that moment I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it were to change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and defensive democracy .
for without democracy our societies are mil@@ ked , our future ble@@ ak , and our great new technologies are wa@@ sted .
on the subject of waste , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin top @-@ parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt , who th@@ rows his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to wealthy savers and corporations , who are too afraid to invest there where it would be productive and bring income with which it would be productive and produce all the things that humanity desper@@ ately needs , for example , &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars were invested in the US , England and the euro zone , in all the wealth produced goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , streets , railway tracks , equipment and so on and so forth .
3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until it compar@@ es it with the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion that circul@@ ated at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing except to infl@@ ate the stock exchanges and raise the real estate prices .
thus , debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks that are un@@ equ@@ alled by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , like in an endless loop , reinfor@@ ces the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors that they do not invest in . just like the father who is afraid of the prophecy of the ro@@ cket could be true that his son would kill him when he grows up ,
un@@ intentionally will bring about the circumstances causing the body to kill him .
this is my hair with capitalism --
its extremely la@@ vis@@ h art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents , and especially to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
of course , the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive factor in the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy was and is that it involved the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive which they granted them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voting rights in questions of state interests .
the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
like a candle that g@@ lows very brigh@@ tly , it is also quickly burned out .
however , our modern liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies don &apos;t have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a statute for rulers .
the liberal democracy only emerged when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- that is , the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone .
in our current demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , there is a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , by gradually hi@@ ring politics and dis@@ em@@ power@@ ing them .
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as in the past ?
it is not a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power , because the power has moved from politics to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ate the animals that they feed on , so that they are star@@ ving at the end .
it is similar to the economy that has made politics so far @-@ stock@@ ed that it har@@ ms itself through the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , the ine@@ quality rises , the macro@@ economic demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their businesses .
the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must bring the politics and the economy together again , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keeps control , as in the ancient Athens , except for the exclusion of the slaves , the women and the foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Mar@@ xi@@ an left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism is doing it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation brings the twin peaks higher , the waste more subli@@ me , and the social conflicts deep@@ en , just as I think -- in countries like China .
we must re@@ organize the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear as a documentary .
the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve human beings , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; to indul@@ ge in long conversations to the meaning of life .
I think we can be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you some examples in the near future .
in the area of the company : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows from one work place to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all revenues come from capital and from redemption and the concept of wage labour is completely out@@ dated .
no distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but the company does not belong . no exchange of exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy : please note that our national currencies would have a vac@@ ill@@ ating exchange rate in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; in the interest of all of humanity .
imagine that the total world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency - we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trading surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world in which investment funds are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time they did not have the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe to you is simultaneously liber@@ ated in which it pre@@ fers privileged people , and Marxist , because they will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ nesi@@ an , global Key@@ nesi@@ an .
but above all else , it is a world in which we can introduce real democracy .
will we awaken in such a world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... we do not do that , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which is called &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only destabili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am completely confused .
BG : indeed , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your talk , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view of China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the sem@@ b@@ lance of a democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in some ways , if I may say that so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ el@@ ly sm@@ ells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I gu@@ essed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing as we had the opportunity to make a new start with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say good@@ bye to us from compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the permanent den@@ ial that a massive fault line passed through the euro@@ zone and continues to mas@@ sively thre@@ aten the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposition -- which was , by the way , the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European Group , have continued to den@@ ounce the den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to get an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the change happens , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what change are you looking for ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future unless we change its constitution .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a minister of finance or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he asser@@ ts that he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extending the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that did not exist .
they merely wanted to bring our government to fall , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions running through the Eurozone .
they did not want to admit that for 5 years they had a disa@@ strous program in Greece .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nobody from the tro@@ ika who imposed this policy on us was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the Eurozone won &apos;t survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if they do not survive , the liber@@ ated centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 it seems to me , it will also be det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you will be wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being part of TE@@ D .
Y@@ V : thank you .
most of them have never heard of Roy Price , although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision Roy had met three years ago .
Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ geho@@ g hair@@ style and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy does not have any choice .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right corner of this curve .
this curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive to where after having watched a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left hand side , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to stop &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the medium term , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they just don &apos;t exc@@ ite .
so he must make sure he &apos;s really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s also the first time Amazon has something to do , that &apos;s why Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
it requires guaranteed success , so it stops a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight Candi@@ dates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where everyone can watch for free .
and if Amazon came out for nothing , you grab , right ?
millions of spectators watch these episodes .
but they don &apos;t know they &apos;re being watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you capture when you start the show , when you pause , what parts you jump over or check again .
they collect millions of data to decide with these data then which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them , and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US Sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so slightly above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company another manager placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always on the look@@ out to find this one super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of holding a competition , he and his team looked at the available data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give to the shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these small details about the audience : what shows they like , what producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
the question is , of course : what happened here ?
you have two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this about ?
because logic somehow states that this should work in everything .
when you collect millions of data for a decision you make , you should be able to make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
what you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is a little frigh@@ tening , because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems here ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come in contact , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here and asks for discharge , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether there is dis@@ miss@@ al or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
it &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies is wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the worst way , they can predict , through data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year um year round , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the data of most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these mistakes , data streams visi@@ bly into decisions of life -- at work , in legal enforcement , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer@@ ized genetics -- an area where some very clever people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able lots of data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy
over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , basically do two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its components , so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , put the individual parts together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we have it all : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to compose parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I believe Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and mind where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience for what they would otherwise have been unable to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; does not stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they had a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they comp@@ eted for TV @-@ ideas , then when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what the data tell us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things are wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and to not forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a J@@ a- or no @-@ question , you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will fight it later with a technical demo .
so far , I have made some decisions in my life , with which I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball becomes wis@@ er and wis@@ er and smar@@ ter . ultimately it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you &apos;re doing and taking risks .
because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
