<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that NSA illegally listened to phones from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA literally gave Iran a blueprint for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not like at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has competed against Risen and urged him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this move he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblowers and spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters had already done before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015 Risen was thus at risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, although for years they have stated that it would be essential for their case, the government's demands were dropped to tears." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and splitting to make statements, it could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, have secretly procured his telephone calls,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, his credit return, and even travel tips with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA Whistleblower and Risen's alleged source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional order because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government's technology allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press may use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there is communication software, which didn't exist yet, as riser had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">One such technology is SecureCode, an open source distribution system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the relevant news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot provide more information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureCode is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that endanger all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is important to us to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snowden have a chance to weigh misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower," ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to report about grievances in the supply of soldiers and report about overcrowded hospitals. or the nearest environmental worker who sheds light on the contaminated water of Flint. or a wall street insiders, warning us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016 the greatest data leak in history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that rich and powerful] [enormous sums of money are hidden in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for a statement.] This week we were sent by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up that?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has mailbox companies in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="49">It is said that a trace of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait nervous for the next release, and on the next unveiled documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the Plot of an agent maker or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems ep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this be done?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by a few to hide and obscure their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these signs.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are less reports in the USA on this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there have been no prominent Americans in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle behind these tax havens, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a leakage of the Cayman Islands or even Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states there is less information needed to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed fraudsters to rip off particularly vulnerable offsprings.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked that all up to one lawyer made suggestions to our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It's not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And in order to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of conduct aggravate." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">That may sound very senseless as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see that some things have started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "in the past few years, we have seen an increase in transparency regarding the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU registers in central registers on a national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the most unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have proposed a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us with Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who will get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need managers in the economy to stand up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this type of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally end the transparency that now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip all over the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was getting late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "and I thought," "" "Oh, man!" ""</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "what am I doing now?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said:" "" "uh, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought, "Oh man! what did I rock in there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he's crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, sneaked at toe tips to the door, and shut my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he had bought depends on his class room. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe the people who were sold strangers to me in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">It was normal for me to accommodate people on my air mattress. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a leap of time, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate is pulling out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could make something about it. our apartment is becoming a designer's bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, including Wi-Fi and a desk, plus a mattress and morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "we created a website and created so" "" "air mattress and breakfast" "" "[AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb]." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham omelets tasted completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared at us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things were rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Bleergczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to investors: "we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when you visit.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet they can invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "that will be the next big thing!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in solace would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we have learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If one has a problem, one is contemplating the things that one can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such things?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we have been striving for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Share your locked mobile phone with your left sitting area.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent flight of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile of a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like this, who actually has Al Gores cell phone now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is channeling for the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you some of the discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name; if he tells you where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 evaluations, all of which say: "he can really cling to very well-locked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">"" "" "" "because a well-thought out feedback system strengthens trust." ""</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to surrender negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had submitted their assessments before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study together with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are in terms of age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little by surprise, we entrust the most to the people who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add a person's call -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if one has more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stems from common ground.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, such as" "" "Hi!" "", "you get no response." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one tells too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "" "Great works of art in your home! I make holidays with my family." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">All our company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the large amount of people who were more than willing to reject those prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievable good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the business is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or devastate apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front, when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There's nothing worse than these calls. it's hurting when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For men trusted one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">When confidence works, something wonderful can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made vacations in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save life even though they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they pass books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay is running.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing fit together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">This is an economical trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it is not just for" "" "leasing industry" "" "to name, the thing will not do justice." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People are part of themselves, and that will change everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, you can compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place one visits, a group of Answers would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub crawour neighborhood of which one has never heard of;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Today apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up for sharing?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of sharing?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable us to build society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces belonging to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered to residents. students who were looking for a place to stay</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children were expelled. incubator programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be guest in a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems not to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar sites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from Happiness and Timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think it's amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for design in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people that look like me.</seg>

<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">It might take a few parking spaces but do not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to view people of other faiths more tolerant, and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radicalization process one has noticed that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the extremist group can do a brainwashing, which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and their ideology is a traitor or fallen away from faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">When we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people going to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves to their imaginations when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim that their ideology is based on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when you look at them, they do not drive what they" "" "read" "" "in their" "" "Holy Scripture" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that makes them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she wanted to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every minister with whom she had spoken brings her to silence and told her that her wrath, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing, and something that gave meaning to their anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization of extremists that promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam reestablished the connection with God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive way for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumtion of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neurological studies -- show that if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian system of governance, conformity and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that when people submit messages in which negatively about Muslims have been reported, they rather voiced military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just a academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood against Muslims swept upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to hollow out the fundament of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">The assignment of collective innocence is not just about having to explain oneself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young couple, married in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.</seg>

<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>

<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we would like to give to our children: one thing that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely practise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat, we rode in silence, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took it out, pulled out my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, for half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to help us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had preferred the courage and compassion of panic and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe?</seg>

<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who may claim that you are holding a TEDTalk, a mentor with a draught, working in a noble thought factory, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I'm totally normal.</seg>

<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want to work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I'm not an exception in any way.</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about becoming a billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism are some of the potential applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-packets entered our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France had built a six-meter high tower of 1,500 bricks in front of the audience. some years ago they started flying with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Connected to each other, air devices reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build resilient structures automatically.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turmoil and generally react to laws of nature.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it must be collective knowing where the mobile objects are in space.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects, which enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, an offshoot of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flying machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands can be executed at the highest level e. g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear-starters,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device trying to hit two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters, it can hover, and therefore has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the flight device doesn't matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practising.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that penetrate the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of mobile parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known around as machines with a thousand moveable parts that come together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft, which only had two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically most remote controlled aircraft. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and transverse thrusters, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is quite simple, there is a lot happening inside the interior, so that it can fly stable and can move anywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starters. to kill it, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of throwing it right when I see all is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in cruelty, this machine is here, the coach with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his direction.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thus he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in the room in all directions, no matter in which direction it is turned or even rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some things can be imagined in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely secure and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate twin propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When assembling them, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller comes out, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by frowning one half.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard micro-quadcopters -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equips them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where it is in space and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you will motivate these demonstrations to rethink new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially safe machine there would like to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us the wages lie in the development and creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">More than 1,3 billion years ago, two black holes were circling to each other in a very distant galaxy. they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth second into pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they shined brighter than all the stars in all galaxies of the whole known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy into the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally talk of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into the space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded into gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let's arrange the events in a temporal fashion.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1,3 billion years ago, there had just been several zelliges lives on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God is at home -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago a group decided particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which might originate through colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized it as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector ligo: the Laser-Interferometer-Radiation-Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following period, the precision of ligo could be significantly increased, which improved the recognition performance enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, one calls it Advanced Ligo now.</seg>
<seg id="484">In early September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to solve some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, just a few days after the detection of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes were screwing through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of My Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In essence, they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves of black holes for 23 years and their observatories like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crackling in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When the shaft is overhauled, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and squeezed into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, lecturers in courses of relativity often lead to a really silly dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and stowed by us during the arrival of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is 20 zeros after the comma followed by a 1. that's why the ligo staff were crazy for them.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured precisely to less than one thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">Kip Thorne, co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by seeing the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">It's different with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible, to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">Your child's face for example.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain properties, such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to listen to the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now I am talking about Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob interrupts her." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"dun Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies lie in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity to listen can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just circular: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same pair of chirping with an additional key change. that sounds so: wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14th 2015 -- a date which I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [surrendes noise] Someone knows what he needs to hear, this is seen as the sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold solar mass, which rotate as quickly as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us briefly consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the lasting meaning of ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo is paving a whole new way to explore the universe, as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practically or fundamentally -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereighty stars explode in super-novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a great deal about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes occur in the nucleus, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would love to explore the first minutes of the cosmos, but we will never see them since the Big Bang is covered by its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And probably the most important thing: I am optimistic that there are all things we have never seen before, which we will never see and of which we have no idea of. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, in the first run, Ligo found things we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the ligo project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, like Ligo it observes, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the dust bones for our archaeological work so to speak.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo offers us a completely different view of the events in space, the creation of the stars and ultimately how we came out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build great detectors and listen to the sounds and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried out an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for a year I would say" "" "yes!" "" "I was afraid of." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say "yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I was afraid of, my fear eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to keep talking, my social fear -- phew, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes" "" "has changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes that profoundly changed my life to an unexpected kind. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the least, calls all" "" "kittens" "" "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the South.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "pussy, I need milk for my bill." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude towards life in my family. from then on I am bothered to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">"" "but it also has an amazing side-effect: only recently I fully understood that the" "" "yes" "" "say to play with my children saved my career." ""</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am the author. I think of things, awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programmes, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment offers hundreds of jobs which did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days four shows, i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programs simultaneously in production, four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run successively on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series in 256 regions in 67 languages run for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are programs that I have created myself and not only produced, so still above. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing it?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you so all of you who work so hard whether you are now managing a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously if I'm talking about work so you can understand that I'm not just sitting on the computer and fantasizing, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not about dreams in a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am immersed in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I ordered troops to paint on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As if you wear a high sound, deliver a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best thing about it is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy road, I could drive on it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume, when I declare to them the totals that I talk about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the totals -- when I started to work and work and work, build, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy. the buzz!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The voice is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, then you cannot strive other than by size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being able to be different than striving for size doesn't matter at what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it's called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I'm not a failure, and I just know that I love summing.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more bound limits, the more work there are, the more things are happening, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to succeed, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land which I created, the marathon which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the totals, the totals, the totals.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I'm the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overworked, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom won't be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says," "" "Sheets, I want to go to Shonda-land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the totals ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The totals did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-day, worked weekends, no regrets, nothing delegate, a Titan does not sleep, does not sleep, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no totum.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was an ad Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just didn't have any fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the totals I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think," "" "Make haste, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you're doing it, you're working, you love what you're doing, being a teacher, a mom, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love someone else, and that's how the buzz feels when you already knew the buzz when the buzz is stopped, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern state waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way out, late, and she says," "" "Mama, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say yes to all and secondly, she didn't call me "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="675">She doesn't call anyone any more "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm a titanium and smother my humming, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about that.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, loneliness and lack of humming, I can't do anything except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I create, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky finger and humid kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl is releasing in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I'm happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy boost is coming in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And not immediately, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is coming back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the totals, but a buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stick to the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The buzzing, the buzz, the titanium dioxide, that's just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am when I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and TV-hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real money is.</seg>
<seg id="707">Buzz is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzzing is the stream that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real totals ignore the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The true humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, for which God told me that I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It's just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule so that I can rid myself of any guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is Law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the humming again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not seeming to me as they work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurting,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This concession is painful, for what kind of man does he prefer to be at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too relaxed is not one of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We are racing around in the garden, back and forth, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dancing parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst pipe bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">At the same time I feel stiffly, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always grab my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live and the humming of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you think me naïve for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And you know why? you are not Rihanna or a muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And when my teenage daughter speaks with me for 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more need not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children get ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are included!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my oasis of well-being, my world. they don't have to be the children. it is important to feel the humming, to have a place for his peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "in order to" "" "play" "" "in general." ""</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The totals came back in my spare time. the totals seem to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz, the buzz is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The buzz of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The buzz of work is part of me, but only a part. and I am so thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is snuffled to me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan who plays a trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my campfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land I create, the marathon that I run, the troops, the canvases, the high sound, the totals, the totals, the other, the right totals: the totals of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, abiding, naked and new attitude towards life is spreading within me. less titanium -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly that buzz, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am the author. I think of things, I catch you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That is part of the job, which means living a dream.</seg>

<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to deal with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low self-healing ability.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have heard of one of the best known, the "deep brain stimulation." in doing so, one implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence neurons "circuits in such a way that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's who suffered from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation does not mean neuro healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that at skull-brain traumas the brain is swollen and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save lives, you have to reduce the pressure of cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this you sometimes have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To let cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François managed to do so.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked just like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the biology classes that stem cells are immature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were dispersed slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the foetus, they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain because we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we re-invaded it at the point of departure of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we re-plan these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we re-plan the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Routers we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we reimplantated the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and reimplantated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-planted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we dye in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we couldn't stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain damage?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had reached a stable skill level, we moved the motor-motor area in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Thereupon the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Exactly as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovering up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic cerebral mechanisms. they recover to some degree, just like the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance before the injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we reimplantated the cells: the same monkey, two months after implantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that these were very exciting results for us as well.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is to implant her in human beings.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"" "Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" "" "I know someone who can do that." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results one has to fill about two kilograms of paper and forms in order to pass through this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that's understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate if it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable sentiments.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"" "" "" "in fact, democracy is dwindling with us, in Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- as finance minister in the Eurogroup, I was unequivocally made clear that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if it were to change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are milked, our future bleak, and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin top-paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt, who throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to wealthy savers and corporations, who are too afraid to invest there where it would be productive and bring income with which it would be productive and produce all the things that humanity desperately needs, for example, "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3,4 trillion US dollars were invested in the US, England and the euro zone, in all the wealth produced goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, streets, railway tracks, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3,4 trillion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until it compares it with the $5.1 trillion that circulated at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing except to inflate the stock exchanges and raise the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks that are unequalled by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which, like in an endless loop, reinforces the pessimism of investors that they do not invest in. just like the father who is afraid of the prophecy of the rocket could be true that his son would kill him when he grows up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally will bring about the circumstances causing the body to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely lavish art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents, and especially to finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course, the athenian democracy included too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the athenian democracy due to these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive factor in the athenical democracy was and is that it involved the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive which they granted them the right to political co-determination with equal voting rights in questions of state interests.</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that glows very brightly, it is also quickly burned out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our modern liberal democracies don't have their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">The liberal democracy only emerged when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- that is, the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our current democracies, since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, there is a relentless struggle between the two, by gradually hiring politics and disempowering them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as in the past?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power, because the power has moved from politics to the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of predators that sustainably decimate the animals that they feed on, so that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that has made politics so far-stocked that it harms itself through the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, the inequality rises, the macroeconomic demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their businesses.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism distributes the "demos" from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must bring the politics and the economy together again, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control, as in the ancient Athens, except for the exclusion of the slaves, the women and the foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxian left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation brings the twin peaks higher, the waste more sublime, and the social conflicts deepen, just as I think -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">We must reorganize the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we are democratizing the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological monitoring hyperautocracy, which makes the film "Matrix" appear as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in "Star Trek," in which machines serve human beings, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," to indulge in long conversations to the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we can be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia rather than the "matrix" similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you some examples in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of the company: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows from one work place to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues come from capital and from redemption and the concept of wage labour is completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but the company does not belong. no exchange of exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy: please note that our national currencies would have a vacillating exchange rate in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries] in the interest of all of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the total world trade is traded in this currency - we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trading surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "imagine that this fund invests in" "" "green" "" "technologies, especially in parts of the world in which investment funds are rare." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time they did not have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "today we have them, especially against the background of a reunified policy and economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is simultaneously liberated in which it prefers privileged people, and Marxist, because they will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else, it is a world in which we can introduce real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world?</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as a libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... we do not do that, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which is called "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Like Hayek, that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am completely confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your talk, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West's view of China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">"" "" "" "in our liberal democracies we have the semblance of a democracy." ""</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some ways, if I may say that so provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to link liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smelly smells of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guessed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later in the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing as we had the opportunity to make a new start with the Eurozone,</seg>

<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European Group, have continued to denounce the denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to get an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and authoritarianism, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the change happens, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>

<seg id="1038">Most of them have never heard of Roy Price, although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision Roy had met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog hairstyle and describes himself on Twitter as "movies, TV, technique, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy does not have any choice.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right corner of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive to where after having watched a season, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left hand side, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to stop "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the medium term, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just don't excite.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he's really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it's also the first time Amazon has something to do, that's why Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">It requires guaranteed success, so it stops a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight Candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where everyone can watch for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon came out for nothing, you grab, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">But they don't know they're being watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show, when you pause, what parts you jump over or check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data then which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them, and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican US Senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so slightly above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he is always on the lookout to find this one super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a competition, he and his team looked at the available data about the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give to the shows, their course, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these small details about the audience: what shows they like, what producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">The question is, of course: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">You have two very competitive, data-sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this about?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that this should work in everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">When you collect millions of data for a decision you make, you should be able to make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">What you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then this is a little frightening, because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software. come in contact, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here and asks for discharge, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether there is dismissal or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">It's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the worst way, they can predict, through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year um year round, until suddenly it didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"" "it simply didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the journal" "" "Nature" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these mistakes, data streams visibly into decisions of life -- at work, in legal enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computerized genetics -- an area where some very clever people use unimaginable lots of data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, basically do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, disassemble this problem into its components, so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, put the individual parts together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we have it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to compose parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I believe Netflix was so successful because they used data and mind where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience for what they would otherwise have been unable to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards" does not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they had a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they competed for TV-ideas, then when they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "" "that's what the data tell us." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things are wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and to not forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question, you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "highly likely" "" "-- right here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fight it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far, I have made some decisions in my life, with which I should have listened to the ball afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball becomes wiser and wiser and smarter. ultimately it's up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you're doing and taking risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
