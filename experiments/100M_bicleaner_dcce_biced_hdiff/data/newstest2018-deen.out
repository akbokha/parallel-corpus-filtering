Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people are to meet today .
a mine chapel , where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers cultivate the former ground of peasants .
Munich &apos;s oldest official map promotes exciting stories .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows that , because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als of Bavaria to the State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - yet very enligh@@ tening .
especially when comparing them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria at@@ las is a fli@@ ck@@ ering carpet , which one does not recognize as such .
in the large overview map , detailed maps , so @-@ called position sheets , were incorporated into cities and municipalities .
these arose according to the Bay@@ erische surve@@ ying authority between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originates from the first survey in Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops were finally removed from Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , today &apos;s neighbours , who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map .
Elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus Bay@@ erische surve@@ ying .
the original position sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is , like all others , to be found on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded into all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was established 21 years after the map was created , i.e. in 18@@ 77 , as the district of Munich .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling concentrate around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbered tiles from the so @-@ called &quot; original recording , &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
today , small par@@ c@@ els do not occupy any farmers anymore - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in the sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the scene of the October test since 18@@ 10 , was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of Is@@ ar , the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen district it is not only possible to read the street name &quot; at the restaurant &quot; or from the height &quot; On the air &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße you once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich @-@ based district @-@ asylum @-@ institute &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; was established .
starting in 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time , and for instance finished sett@@ ling the so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he prohibited the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients first place was first , later on 500 places were expanded .
at some point , this capacity was insufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ aissance in hair 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um München @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , is located there .
young people meet in the area of the former Au@@ er Institute in Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities .
West is the TS@@ V Munich football field east , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built - architec@@ turally referring to the original building of the asylum system that had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 and the Kauf@@ inger@@ strasse was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed a lot of holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a large remained until today - at Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages stood at Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days were prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn station .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
citizen Rights Group publishes Travel War@@ ning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the national association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the Federal State Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ ameri@@ can travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to pay special attention when travelling by the state , as a number of question@@ able , rac@@ ist @-@ based incidents occur recently throughout the state and be noted here , &quot; says the Group &apos;s statement .
a recently adopted Mis@@ sour@@ i law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination suits , as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state that dispro@@ portion@@ ately target minorities , initiated the group to issue the warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more gasoline during the trip and taken custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of crime .
the Council also pointed to a recent report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General , which shows that black mot@@ ori@@ sts in the state are 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Saint . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring Cau@@ tion money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i reported in 2015 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the hate crime report of the FB@@ I , which classi@@ fy the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th place of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the States had adopted immigration laws that local law enforcement agencies commit to arrest people due to immigration violations , which will contribute to further ra@@ cial profil@@ ing according to AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but l@@ ately stakeholders have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
soft fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n project is a successful project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have given a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ Orts@@ verband , together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties , met with the right @-@ wing court of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insight into his farm , in which he managed 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as well many k@@ itt@@ ens provided and accommod@@ ated in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative market@@ able marketing path for milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only region@@ ales arrive at the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also the chairman of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fis@@ her@@ man Fisch@@ bach &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he described the soft @-@ fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit on such steep areas .
the green area pro@@ visi@@ oning for a lot of work , much has to be worked on with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed it without any chemical plant protection and fertili@@ ser , even if it does not lead to bio@@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e recognised the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leader promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3,000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .
I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the land could be drawn out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how to continue their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced off by eleven participants .
the open space is therefore 40 hectares , which cannot be aff@@ or@@ ested by at least 20@@ 23 .
half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was supported by a leader , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
thus , the farmers kept 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 km pasture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and farmers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter Weiß asser@@ ted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ schaft@@ sch@@ ungs@@ Gui@@ deline ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state sponsor@@ ship of electric f@@ ences .
the aim is to open the Black Forest .
the pre@@ condition is the existence of a flow set drawn by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the surface to be fenced must not be tractor @-@ free ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation .
for the fis@@ her bacher Tommy project in 2018 the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els is currently underway , which will build just under 16 kilometres of fence .
the open space is 35 hectares and the calculated costs are more than 1@@ 12@@ ,000 euros .
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump @-@ regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the president &apos;s proposals for the dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller did not touch the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ants would have ly@@ n@@ ched him if he had done it .
but he took up the importance and in particular the importance attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the memorial , was added to his base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem to which you refer , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tually correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about contemporary resonance on the crum@@ bling words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , and your oppressed masses who y@@ earn to breathe freely , and the el@@ lowing apost@@ asy of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our screens was better to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took a high political action .
the sculpture was to show the ties between French and American republi@@ can@@ ism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classic depic@@ tion .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone , but rather an early Neo@@ conserv@@ atives bringing the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch will not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh was rather unusual here .
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the standpoint of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted , el@@ event@@ ful , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
in the tru@@ est sense it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they need to hear .
and this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever wish to acknowledge .
their torch will not light up the path , but the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team
the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship cad@@ re &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 , starting on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special developed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ flip - who are competing against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m distance , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected captain of the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her Captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world champi@@ onships in the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads along this path and last year raised five British and two European records .
it will take part in the 1.500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1.500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man , which one should observe after a great season , which included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champi@@ onships , when the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was .
the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots not only belong to the team , but in some cases also be involved in the med@@ als and the fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ate voted for me and chose me makes it something special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots belonging to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums .
concerning my speech as Captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block critics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the heat @-@ up of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the papers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he was argu@@ ing with the cri@@ tique , sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans staff have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and that is why the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union def@@ end@@ ant him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a reaction with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a guy like Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the nation &apos;s 50 govern@@ ors .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and rigor@@ ous adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skil@@ ful to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair @-@ loose head after chemotherapy on his side .
that is why the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , which is called official and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ woman , Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse , defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing but a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of tro@@ lls or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing online the whi@@ p .
the post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are just true people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no tro@@ lls .
they all said their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful , and not prof@@ ane .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary box &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take a stand on the same issue , they are more likely to be dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of people affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff designated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical clo@@ ths and to arrest or sil@@ enced prot@@ esters .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County decre@@ ed the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she banned a vot@@ er from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this shouldn &apos;t be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable airport had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers were multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and an anonymous letter writer struck his lead .
and even then Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , which critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Great Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project .
but he did not silence them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the foundation of our nation .
and true guidance means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former European No@@ .1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort over the next three days since the ren@@ aissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who ran right next year in the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rap@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he laid down this place .
he is an avi@@ d advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won the European Tour as well as the European Competition Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels particularly good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the home @-@ based player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since she was taken out of the program in the year after I had won her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always cher@@ ish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the promotion on his home ground .
this event will be his first Scottish show since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a little more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer through passive smoking
in the past two decades less and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases are due to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said academic director Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this topic from 1994 .
at that time there have been 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
house connections turn out to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are somewhat in time , &quot; says the head of the Fred Hein@@ ze farm .
in the area of the house @-@ connections , the situation is more complicated than assumed , as underground is much mountains , which is not indicated in the plans .
traffic , which is constantly obstruc@@ ting the construction work , is a major problem for the construction company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ ori@@ sts against red lights and shut @-@ off grids is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are eligible for transit .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kot@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z of the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite ti@@ ring . &quot; &quot; &quot;

poverty and death in the Indonesian gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a stove .
it rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai rule in the un@@ settled Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the carb@@ oni@@ zed tu@@ ber is removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the ground floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. to wash clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless space serves as lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of her husband &apos;s four wives , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be dangerous to work late : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to walk around in the village after 5@@ pm , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote for a public raising in front of the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement that stir@@ red up independence for the Dutch rule was swiftly appe@@ aled to the government of Jak@@ arta , who maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea incorporated the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive by car .
there is no public transport .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from corrugated iron roofs , which were converted by rust into various yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her light coat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is the poor@@ est province of Indonesia , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst childhood and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it &apos;s also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable Gold mine in the world , gr@@ assy hill , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high country province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3.000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port min@@ ed gold and copper worth 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources worth $ 78 billion worth $ 78 billion .
these fortun@@ es , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military safegu@@ ards a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 almost $ 20 million , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ tian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands were tor@@ tured , tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ ua &apos;s tribal high@@ land during the 1970 &quot; s became genocide in line with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Wer@@ den Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric sho@@ cks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the screws have increased since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing as Muslim economic migrants are coming from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung caf@@ et@@ erias sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetable served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people are fighting to keep up here .
&quot; migrants have started selling chi@@ ckens and vegetables cheaper on the traditional market than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local who went to work in the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cost the native Pap@@ ua - Mama @-@ M@@ um &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - her market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President J@@ oko Har@@ do@@ do , known as the Jok@@ ow@@ ai , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations in Pap@@ ua during his campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but little changed in Pap@@ ua , and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that it will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , only two months after Jok@@ ov@@ is &apos;s initi@@ ation , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers attacked their tone and later returned with four soldiers , according to the local Pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their def@@ enses , said sacrifices and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus , Y@@ von@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into a coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting arches and introduced the Wa@@ ita dance - in circle and im@@ it@@ ating a bird song - from Pap@@ ua &apos;s Me@@ e P@@ ago strain .
some demonstr@@ ators started to sling stones at police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released by local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home .
no one was listening in the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in was the witness of the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ama , who , like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , only carries a name , the TI@@ ME in a glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw it was dead ... I knew it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ e@@ M@@ ende , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news of the kill@@ ings came on the next day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
for three weeks , in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he would set up an extra @-@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historic human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 &apos;s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we are committed to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wi@@ ran@@ to , who charged the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; demanding more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence referendum in 1999 , said 11 cases of violations of human rights have already been included in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with gri@@ m dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid of being shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us reiter@@ ated that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; he says .
the shooting did not cease .
on Tuesday , the Indonesian police fired on vill@@ agers in the Dei@@ y@@ ai neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a building company who refused to bring an unconscious man to hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ g , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but local people say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting on the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were delivered quickly , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called on the officers involved to hold accoun@@ t@@ ability and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police out of the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an inno@@ c@@ ence for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al living in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily arrested in the last few years , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never dive again .
among the people of Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a &quot; tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just out of range .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the indigenous Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived at the hub of Nab@@ ire in greater numbers since the opening of new routes .
the few jobs there are in the region usually go to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants .
Pap@@ ua seldom have capital or necessary skills to keep their own companies competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Go@@ bai , the chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribal board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission to film was given to them .
according to P@@ hel@@ ine K@@ ine , Human Rights Watch &apos;s deputy head of Asia , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s electoral campaign have not been realised in order to raise the limits of reporting in order to promote transparency and development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s most un@@ rest provinces of Pap@@ ua and Western Pap@@ ua : visa refusal and black@@ list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ ua .
in March , six Pacific States - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands challenged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai firing .
the same countries have historically seen O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Ar@@ r@@ ha@@ tha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the group &apos;s accus@@ ations and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human right ambassador , K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but wants to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua are saying that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Go@@ bai , the chairman of the tribal board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , the families of the Pun@@ i@@ ai fire victims led a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ p@@ se of a victim was buried in an area just opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never give justice to them , but at least they don &apos;t forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a lowered head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire records the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per of Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest living towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 3@@ 37 meter high , 79 @-@ story building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the sky@@ scra@@ per in just two years , which is coinci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , violations were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the people &apos;s scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a resident who called his name George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ ba@@ is &apos;s civil protection authorities said the fire fighting units were extingu@@ ishing the fire at 4 : 00 p.m. local time ( 00 : 00 GMT ) and the building cooled off . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government said that they are working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can resur@@ rec@@ t questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damages came from facing , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation .
in Britain the police said that the system of plates for isolation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) went through with his large Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the Davis Cup single was a revolutionary suggestion for this sport to play only two profits , and won &apos;t be supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
these often very long , but even therefore highly este@@ emed five @-@ set classics remain the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of the member countries voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore just missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work to improve the rate of application .
not until the vote , after many in@@ consist@@ encies , the proposal was already made to fill the fin@@ als at a neutral location .
new from 2018 are only comparatively small details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be hosting the host right next year in the following year .
in order to reduce the costs for the Organ@@ izer , the requirements in terms of training positions , etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media events prior to the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 US passengers bring forbidden items into the plane , find a survey
a survey among passengers showed that more than 20 percent were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled by deliberately or un@@ consciously forbidden items at the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 per cent who entered the plane while wearing in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently forbidden knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed that they had late discovered that they had gone mad with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people , conducted by a jet @-@ charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
from those surv@@ eyed admitted that they have know@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent were mill@@ enni@@ als compared to less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X were .
the most common items intentionally passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent admitted to know@@ ingly carried objects with blades through security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs to the plane .
the company said it had inter@@ viewed travelers across the country to find out how many acci@@ dently shipped s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling goods through airport security and how many had done it intentionally .
it is no surprise that people , most likely s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who fly most frequently .
however , the company pointed out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which fluids they are allowed to take with or how much of it .
so there is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids purchased by the T@@ SA are forbidden fluids .

El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
electric @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to give up with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
in doing so , he has so far assumed that some of the customers have already with@@ drew their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever tri@@ ump@@ tious figures on sales increases and more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k announced for the first time a different , less da@@ zz@@ ling number : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k had often recru@@ ited more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose ex@@ tradition has just begun .
now Mus@@ k is dre@@ aming : of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 reservations , 63@@ ,000 had already been withdrawn .
critics always pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present 45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are present , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .
the Tes@@ la Group , however , does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
by 2018 , all models should be taken together - 500@@ ,000 by 2020 , one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are made per day .
if you order a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today , you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la is able to drive his brand @-@ new production lines that have never been tested in practice without any major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to bigger delays , then the binding nature of the reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ cont@@ ented customers from running away in flocks .
EPA Chief P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s due to the hes@@ it@@ ant of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after being acc@@ using of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Authority , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama Er@@ a in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ ck presented the change as his agency turned out to be responsive to the needs of government environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint filed against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a deadline that expi@@ red on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for near @-@ ground o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfer@@ ing in local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump public prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental protection regulations .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulation that resist@@ s the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden conversion from Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ denti@@ al roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards simply reinfor@@ ces the willingness of the EPA to co @-@ operate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to meet the dead@@ lines for execution and then been waiting to be charged by activists and others , and in an agreement to determine the date for carrying out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who charged the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court procedures and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we take the law and the authority that gives it to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Republi@@ cans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the O@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the decision was not made in the Senate yet .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who pres@@ ided over the coalition of States that had lam@@ ented the EPA this week , said the group wanted to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ al of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil Oz@@ on occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and to thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists shou@@ ted about P@@ ru@@ ch &apos;s surprising course change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 Years St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church
750 Years St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 am to a seren@@ ade .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ arc their concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village jewel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württemberg document of documents : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ lingen and the vo@@ g@@ tei , &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the document of the document , besides the former parish church , besides the former parish church , there was also a splendid courtyard , which belonged to the church or the patron saint and not vice versa .
so there were people living there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , besides the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still recognis@@ able today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Berg &quot; is the third , the noble sett@@ ler @-@ centre of the village .
old maps from around 1600 substanti@@ ate these historical facts .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from early medieval church law .
a gent@@ leman who built a church , bur@@ dened and occupied with a priest still remained the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath this church .
this was accompanied by the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ at@@ est of the two crushed on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later it had to be released during the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 @-@ 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were in@@ filtr@@ ated and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camped near the church .
they broke out pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the cemetery was also used as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed .
only the bell tower was left standing .
in the New Year &apos;s night in 18@@ 34 a storm broke the steep@@ le and half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the tower still existing today remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius facility by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; creative reti@@ re@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as successor of Dieter D@@ ock@@ horn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday , July 16 , the organizers invite the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ arc to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
it is designed by the Com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
the former Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann talks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
to the end of the seren@@ ade a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organizers set out the fantastic view .
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for tum@@ ors and listeners .
the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens feel particularly committed to home care such as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini .
association wants to test approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see a legal requirement for the construction and therefore turned to the coun@@ cil@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim hi@@ des itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved at all , since at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind force concentration camp at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
within this zone of concentration , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
such zones are intended to prevent the &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; of the landscape .
the city of Vier@@ sen had a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , a few days before , but it had not authorized the district government of Düsseldorf because of a formal alli@@ bility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , the chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council again approved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is where granting a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the respective letters have been received by the Vier@@ sen circle since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes it to the occasion to examine the matter once more .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to express itself in regards to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four four @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65@@ ha large area .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines , electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ se@@ ater households .
the NEW Re Group wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s city coun@@ cill@@ or gave the green light to purchase three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .

a woman was injured le@@ thal .
two further persons were slightly injured .
the state road was closed for hours .

city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ ei@@ a and people from the region are to discover the shopping opportunities in the city center in September .
the commercial club and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the residents to shopping in the city centre .
as the president of the business association , Christian König , announced that the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers their own city provides away from the usual supermarket product .
a market with regional vendors is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic companies should present themselves with their training places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city center invite to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the promotion aims not only on the inhabitants of the city and the region .
in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , says Christian König .
the city administration and the commercial association co @-@ operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the business association and the city are thus entering a further stage of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Attrac@@ tive city centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these include new offerings such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to the well together with selling Sunday , talks with all business operators and hosts in order to move them to active participation .
also attractive offers for Saturday and the aband@@ on@@ ment of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials are to be re @-@ opened or opened again .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals lost the city center when shopping out of sight .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to li@@ ven up the city center - to land@@ lords , the companies of the whole city and clubs .
it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that was partly spreading , had been said to King in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , the first five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities , will take part for the first time .
next to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advertise for the appreciation of local trade and emphas@@ ise its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his purchasing behaviour .

a first missing person later was also found dead .
the dead were the employees of the school .
as a result of the accident , the authorities assumed works on a gas line .

Tr@@ ump put forward le@@ aked tran@@ scripts of phone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January Tr@@ ump asked in a telephone call with Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to to quit publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president has insul@@ ted him because he den@@ ounced the wall publicly . according to reports , he said to him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull told that a trade for the US , who emig@@ rated to Australia , was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was conveyed by the Obama administration , would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump concluded the call after he said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; That &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford @-@ massacre : activists carry rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and rum@@ ored to the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stepped forward with guns to block its path .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer strip - took a long train at his ci@@ gar , looking through the wind@@ screen .
in@@ doors the occup@@ ants were floating in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
cri@@ es broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is only a reproduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience met very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , civil rights activists join the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ col@@ m and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were ly@@ n@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever charged with murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ comprehensible that in all these years no single person has been arrested - although we see them in our churches even though we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks who helps organizing the post @-@ employment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of Georgia and a life long citizen .
for him , the post @-@ employment serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that an injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need to get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a medical officer puts a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford Lyn@@ ching on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but none was ever indic@@ ted .
although the susp@@ ects have been on the free base for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer campaign .
roughly at the same time as the election , according to the FB@@ I , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ col@@ com had a white landlord , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , down during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ or was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .
on July 25 , 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when they got away from prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a mo@@ b mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepared and arranged the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in murder , removing evidence and obsc@@ uring the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene managed the annual exhibition of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is descri@@ p@@ tive , gri@@ pping , and is rooted in a kind of deep rac@@ ism that many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of black - crowded into a room and listened when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene co @-@ director .
he has played the role of Chief @-@ C@@ lan@@ co @-@ member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors Dar@@ by Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ col@@ m , who scre@@ ams H@@ ester and pus@@ hes him angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He , go away from my property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire respon@@ ds to the fire .
there is a pause .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ cona asked .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people back then --- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black performers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is exactly where the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman , dressed in a dress of mourning , stands above the bodies of the actors and seduc@@ es Bil@@ lie Holidays lau@@ d &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice is breaking with every other word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen viewers caught sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many just come down the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as for almost eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch mur@@ ders took place , the air will feel sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the last notes of the song are sounding out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the car@@ c@@ asses .
children sit on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember .
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks a lot - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wipe their tears off .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit who played the cl@@ an member .
Nick Ras@@ cona fli@@ rts with two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks out with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that it is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sat together with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white couple from Atlanta talks about the night with a black pair that they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky strug@@ gled to find words which feelings the performance left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me lets me believe that the Lyn@@ x is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Today this is called the police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks &apos;s courtyard holds at his table , he eats and rec@@ alls the civil rights .
he said he had already started planning the performance in the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emphasis is in a certain way inspiring , as it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a multi @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous st@@ aging in front of a giant , six @-@ stor@@ eyed setting .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Alek@@ sand@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) optionally shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner together with Wall B@@ rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car park , in which the Rhein@@ g@@ frei@@ ghters are pos@@ ing as a rock energy or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil drums remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ mo@@ tiv - money , power and gre@@ ed - which is moving through his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging .
the three Rhine clo@@ cks - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise like in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .
k@@ ess seduc@@ ed Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , gr@@ ind a cor@@ p@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ man@@ ners and pass the Kra@@ gel@@ o Cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the grand fi@@ esen Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when Siegfried turns into Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) has to believe in it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with a strong applause .
in a stor@@ my way , Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who mo@@ dest@@ ly bend his hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te , are celebrated .
there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the big heat again in casual clothing .
the performance by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited .
in 2013 , he had to let go of the organ of the Pfei@@ f@@ konzert , five years later , there were great rejo@@ icing in which the isolated &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls proce@@ eded .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have rejo@@ iced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one notices that the audience with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has somehow grown together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of his view .
I draw a positive resume .
Max Quanti@@ ty works as a volunteer
they work in their volunteer year at several places .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture market , once a week I will help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at school in the open all @-@ round .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does that come about ?
amount : I did a high school diploma .
and then a design engineer , let &apos;s say , abor@@ ted successfully .
for me , I realized that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different with people .
and then I asked what you do .
do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focus maybe also , really is .
and was it like that ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
in the winter semester , I will start my studies in the social system .
I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker training and study at Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different places of use during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you are doing your FS@@ J .
one can do it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was exactly the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different to the degree in civil engineering ?
amount : sure , here it &apos;s not about calculating stil@@ ts .
again and again there are other people who have a very different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a youth , who has been taken out of the family - one must always deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no fear of touch ?
amount : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is .
Pear@@ son abbrevi@@ ates further 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut its divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is facing .
the job cuts previously announced by CEO John Fall@@ on in the end of 2018 and early 2019 will also result in his previous restructuring , where 4,000 points have already been lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the fiscal year remained unchanged after generating an increase of 1 percent to 2.0@@ 5 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul Con@@ vo@@ y attack : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in Kab@@ ul , the capital of Afghanistan , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , shared a NATO Declaration .
according to local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h subur@@ b .
bombing is the last violent act that hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a NATO statement it is said that the explosion happened on Thursday evening when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by an impro@@ vised explosive device carried by individuals . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the U.S. military hospital on the air@@ field of B@@ agra@@ m .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the UN , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide car accident killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had executed this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the city centre killed more than 150 people with the country &apos;s dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack , since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Tali@@ ban out of power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. forces supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule by law@@ suits
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , which states that the states are obliged to contain the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 states accused the agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EP@@ O announced late on Wednesday the decision to push forward the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone rules 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said that they show the agency &apos;s commitment to co @-@ operate with States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA Chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which in part of the country pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured to determine where inc@@ isions must be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - in order to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the District of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that is said to boost economic growth , according to Tr@@ ump .
however , the efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of the Democrats and nature reserves who are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the website of EPA says that inhal@@ ing air containing o@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can reduce pul@@ mon@@ ary function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
common room wants common room
at the end the decision was clear : at two opposing voices , the municipal council of flu@@ o @-@ win@@ king decides to set up a community space in the future residential complex .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing piece of land is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will continue until the area belonging to the church community has remained in the community , there is now no planning permission for the project to be st@@ em@@ med by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common area for this .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council stipul@@ ates that such a common area is not to be seen as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ous housing , but openly in the congregation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget will be sweet@@ ened by funding opportunities .
the building is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a community space would be , according to T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible .
the proposal fores@@ ees to signal the investor that in this regard it is not possible to throw a bil@@ let between the legs , the finding that both the saddle and the surrounding area are le@@ aning - as well as pitch roof - which reduces the lifting height and makes the construction more economical .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer means this addition .
when it helps : it unanim@@ ously passes the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many of his own buildings with which you don &apos;t get so much forward , but now you lean out of the window at the common room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m doing hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger definitely speaks for the community space - but absolutely against communal participation .
it sees behind it a concealed subsi@@ dy to wealthy or foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but receives a real equivalent in the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
at the request of Sta@@ al , three advoc@@ ates will find the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original programme that Stefan H@@ aller summari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we take the decision like this , we make a huge step to close a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with car : cycli@@ st is thrown on the street
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car in Gar@@ ath on Wednesday and severely injured .
as the police announced , the 82 @-@ year Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from the direction of Hil@@ den coming from 12.@@ 20 hrs on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg .
the senior wanted to cross the track at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction accor@@ ded him the priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder entered the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the opposite traffic .
he met a car that ste@@ ered a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown on the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital by ambul@@ ance .
FC Bayern Munich must refra@@ in from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
with personnel care , FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season .
seven pro@@ s are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the personnel care staff of the German football @-@ record master Bayern Munich is getting bigger and bigger at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must refra@@ in from carrying out the Special with the BV@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
the Italian confirmed this on Friday .
in addition , the M@@ ens Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has held the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory match of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German soccer heav@@ y@@ weights draws the fans under spell .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
walking in the resin of star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Trail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created in the Harz Mountains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is planned by the association Observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a planet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; planet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Göttingen since 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is coming to meet the information needs of many visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check this out St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be supplemented by internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later on , the train will be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Star@@ way the viewers experience a lot of interesting facts , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars could have different colors or why a star was more light than another , even though it was much more distant .
I will also medi@@ ate in which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg in 2014 , the highest located astronom@@ ical observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the Harz National Park ranks among the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can clearly be seen .
in the Uni @-@ Stadt since 2003 at the initiative of the Sup@@ porting Society Planet@@ arium Go@@ ett@@ ingen , there is something similar to the planned Star@@ wer@@ g Plan@@ etary Trail .
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet journey leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( commune of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the degra@@ ded Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun standing exactly 75 meters away measures 70 centimet@@ ers .
the total distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
while the light from sun to Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than light in space .
the march to the next star , however , would last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko are meeting for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 l@@ bs , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN branches in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the failed World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight Champion , went down the hall to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization Super spring weight champion .
following Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous vote on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko is defending his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the pair posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas@@ h noticed that a possible show@@ down would be the &quot; perfect size &quot; between the fighters .
&quot; I &apos;m a former spring weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia remembered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I grew up for Bron@@ ters &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I would like to come down to light weight .
and he must move to lightweight @-@ weigh@@ ers &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is the demand for the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
climate mates asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year to schedule a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the battle against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight title fight in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all the fans were in demand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later expressed himself openly to fight on the network that offers the best finance package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he appreciated Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he could possibly participate in his Saturday battle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko thought of the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said he thinks that the three combat champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to quit the K@@ o @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said that the focus was to show impact , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top comb@@ at@@ ants , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four injuries after the tyre plat@@ ter
in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four persons were seriously injured on Thursday after@@ no@@ ons .
after initial information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost market wide control over his vehicle shortly before the end of the market .
the passenger turned to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where he over@@ turned and then remained on the roof in the green strip .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was blocked in the direction of the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; chain works better &quot;
and@@ re Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener to the season op@@ ener of Brun@@ swi@@ ck , that the optimization of the defensive formation in Au@@ e points brings points .
with the first match of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result too , would not have been the two ad@@ versaries at 2 : 2 against Brun@@ swi@@ ck .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three chain is to be further optimized .
and the tro@@ user won &apos;t want to catch a gate after a kick @-@ off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be no more to be placed next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that even after the experience in preparation with the three chain , his team is better able to cope better than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not yet know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have just in the triple chain on the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Fo@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ izing and we do not make so many mistakes in the construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also travels to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about an un@@ decided start , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his coach didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; I judged the start of the season only after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to a storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the au@@ e players might even be a bit fres@@ her as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an ascension preference in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know 100 percent where they are currently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defender of the inner &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although guests from the Rhin@@ eland become an easy favourite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep it away , just because we have the right to get among the first six , is non@@ sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e out of nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga which must be beaten in advance , &quot; says For@@ tun@@ as Chef@@ coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to see his players in no case on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish Asyl@@ um holder assessment test published
recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who underwent a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Department of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Rä@@ t@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started performing tests last year .
during the asylum procedure they should make a more precise assessment of age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critici@@ zed for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
until today , Migration verk@@ et has sent 6.@@ 8@@ 80 cases to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency noted that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; might be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the person &apos;s age is questioned .
according to Johan Go@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases where the person has been judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
in May the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases suggest@@ ing that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year .
the method of the medical age assessment , in the X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work includes the assessment of human biological maturity in order to see whether sooner or later than usually they went through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the kind of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judging the biological age in this way is very un@@ safe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot safely say it , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday , a concrete part of the bridge was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going to be great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , head of construction at the department of road construction and traffic in the Regier@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the works began at the same time on all three refur@@ bish@@ ment bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be comp@@ lied with .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is an arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has come into the years now .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished .
the other two bridges run over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning got a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons weigh@@ ted bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the northern side .
this is a rim attachment that is also used as operating mode .
at the southern part of the bridge a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge can be used on Friday .
the pedestrian walk@@ way will be on top of it .
the special thing about this is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps .
the laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach requires particular finger@@ tip sensitivity .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable that many companies are connected to .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish first had to be f@@ ished .
traffic is regulated by a traffic light for the bridges between the building site and the collecting fork in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed .
the cost of the three bridge investments is 700@@ ,000 euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ ang Protest at German potato salad
it doesn &apos;t happen that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which is otherwise very difficult to get under a hat .
the parties represented in the Krei@@ stag party ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) are among a wide alliance that will show a peaceful flag on this day , because the Af@@ D invites R@@ ond@@ ell to &quot; great election campaign &quot; in Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle .
as Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land , brings the leading duo for the German elections on 24 September , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix von Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot for hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ A @-@ speakers but to demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the city picnic under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned on the fountain square , but is now place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and there@@ with right in front of the eyes of those coming to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair@@ woman of the Forum A World and one of the main organizers , is pleased : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; original German potato salad , which also the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few meters from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D volcanic Eifel reports that he has tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there were not enough parking spaces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; well , the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
there is also a band for entertainment at around 8@@ pm , in the Stad@@ thalle there are several speakers , among them the German Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D Chairman Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the leading candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix von Stor@@ ch hold their speeches .
the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
the Af@@ D event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is announced shortly after 21 : 00 .
the police can move - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli will be available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Monastery concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 20 o &apos;clock in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; hits a classical German training with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and win solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the solo@@ ist of the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo voice of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire to not only cross the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds at the two as in a new gar@@ b , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of jazz ech@@ oes N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free games mix into an intri@@ gu@@ ing overall artwork .
this key part of the program was premi@@ ered this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously integrated into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart on her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the best @-@ known relationship of Hollywood star was her &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who finally dealt bitter@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the gre@@ edy act@@ ress asser@@ ts against the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously in love with anyone I &apos;ve posted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;ve played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation Kri@@ sten admitted that they were bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and seriously believed in it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never been confused or obstruc@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I just never liked to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially among them , she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the school time when she rather dressed like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , they don &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and this anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some may call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening a manifestation with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of reflection ... today I will say to you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised previously a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
according to For@@ bes , Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party , which would rather prevent us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement by Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party , which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , unanim@@ ous message , &quot; said the R@@ NC chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the global leader of the field of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an open ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed into the sport again .
Russia &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who have been cut off gold and silver med@@ als in competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite its comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted in favour of the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to the repor@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognised by itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been achieved , but the Congress supports Task Force recommendations that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupted system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics World Championships starting Friday in London following the rigor@@ ous IA@@ AF as neutral players .
the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for a re@@ mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden coaches are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
trimm@@ ing ceremony for soldiers cut off in Mali
during a funeral service in F@@ ritz@@ lar , north Hes@@ sian , around 1000 people of the two died in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
the Minister of Defence , Ursul@@ a von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing to the even un@@ resolved crash fact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but she described the two turned drivers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cor@@ kers of their profession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice they have brought in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er Cathedral St. Peter .
at mid@@ day only the relatives in the church f@@ arewell .
after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
among them H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the wounded laid down roses , the relatives stood arm in arm on the coff@@ ins .
before the church , F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built the flying operation of the martial artist Tiger at F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach , commander of the regi@@ ment , to whom the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this occupation could not turn the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doubts about the UN mission in Mali were not shown by the Le@@ yen : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the deployment is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country of which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral ceremony , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where to be buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried alongside his wife after his death .
this divided the royal house on Thursday .
the Danish royal couple is traditionally settled in Ros@@ kil@@ de Cathedral .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , and she continued in her message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , remains unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become a king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he retired in 2016 and also takes the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince &apos;s Su@@ pper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik had not received the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the head @-@ speaker of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , remains unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French noble family , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people were always hel@@ pless , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year @-@ old reign .
Hen@@ rik said in a auto@@ biography about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did critic@@ ised .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stum@@ ps instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the gau@@ ch@@ ises I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of society critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed happy with this position and not ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants swift re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
according to the loss of the red @-@ green government majority , Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) refuses to step back for a rapid re @-@ election of the country .
this was the reason for the resolution of the Parliament on Friday .
the surprising res@@ ignation of a Gre@@ ens de@@ pu@@ ties from their state parliament in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover lost its short one @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
El@@ ke T@@ westen , former Green Party , founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election circuit in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
s &amp; D Group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ur@@ ler wants to recommend his group to include them .
in this way , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
until now , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be regularly elected on January 14 , 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sm@@ ur@@ ers said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether or not they can continue to rule in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers that the Land@@ tag decides as soon as possible its self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Land Constitution also provides the possibility that the Land@@ tag chooses confidence and chooses a successor to the Prime Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these opportunities must be insp@@ ected legally clean , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ anks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ urg@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ wen@@ ens Step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens called on the stub@@ born de@@ pu@@ ties to return their land to land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of course assume that she returns her country day mandate , which she received via the green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen extra@@ ordinarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she deliberately decided not to pron@@ ounce a foreign language pron@@ unciation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Schulz &apos;s candidate for Chancellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens MEP El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the voters , but also betra@@ yal of Red @-@ Green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Federal President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly re@@ vote the parliament day .
the exit of Western Europe costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony by the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her latest vanity and fru@@ stration expressed her personal interests against the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony manages this dirty intri@@ gue and attempts to make it political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
s &amp; D Group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ur@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to incorporate El@@ ke T@@ westen into the CD@@ U .

interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ sies , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal occur ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the German editorial office ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , how can the consumer protect himself from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to watch the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information about the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , after all , what we are currently aware of , a health hazard is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the re@@ conn@@ aissance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has opened immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s concern .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
the trade has to ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and harmless to health .
if the residual residual content of 0.0@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded with eggs , these are non @-@ transfer@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time , not the operations are to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to the state of knowledge , production plants are not directly responsible .
on the contrary , they have to face economic damage due to the alleged illegal practices of service companies .
as always , there are too few controllers in the emergency .
is it lacking only on the staff or at the conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was just the official controls that have uncovered the process .
the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent ruled out .
it is precisely for this reason that a consistent education of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ utor in cases where criminal off@@ ences may be present are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete clari@@ fication from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular alarm mis@@ m necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to receive exclusively safe and market@@ able food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an un@@ authorised insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly indign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
through the company , manufacturers , distributors and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ giving animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately .
it must work consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all competent authorities that the facts are resolved quickly and without gaps .
how the balls &apos; financial rules affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organisation that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G must prove at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( $ 26@@ 2 million ) to buy the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount tens of tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PS@@ G can make money loose with security so that N@@ ey@@ mar will sign and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the wealthy family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but have to counter@@ act with legitimate sources of income that enable them to break the break @-@ even point in their business related to football .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini for his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that associations who had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success effectively che@@ ated and ris@@ ked to ruin if banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debt of clubs to monitoring their losses .
the change meant that the business model , which Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a har@@ sh@@ er affair .
in the current three @-@ year period of FF@@ P , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros .
although Plat@@ ini &apos;s 2015 Pres@@ idency has fallen in favor of the Pres@@ idency , the UEF@@ A successor , Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to sc@@ are off excessive expenses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly intensi@@ fy the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the sales revenue for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the har@@ dest sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later was lowered to 20 million euros - and it has been arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs trying to out@@ wi@@ t their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing was to exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not allow it to be considered legitimate .
that was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA &apos;s sponsor@@ ship was raised by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 cont@@ ested that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup ambassador is going to be and such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could be easy to find out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive every attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UEF@@ A had no preliminary discussions with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announced on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with sales of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales .
the association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signing .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players to see , and they tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s immobili@@ se by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ar@@ senal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La league against a state that finan@@ ces an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and this has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect financial fair@@ play because one can deal with different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new source supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet collaboration is coming to an end : the airline will re@@ write the order .
Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; on Friday at the news agency s@@ da .
according to the current plan , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subject to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson .
around 17 million tiny red and white s@@ labs of 14 grams per year distribute the cabin crew to the passengers before landing .
Swiss does not want to provide information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders in terms of &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a sho@@ oter manufacturer .
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there is at the new tender .
however , only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y aims to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement .
since 2006 , the Swiss chocolate tablets are distributed on board their flights .
prior to signing a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry Cal@@ le@@ baut had supplied the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g .
for two and a half years Swiss took the opportunity to place the logo in partnership with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline co@@ operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights , the First Class customers are indul@@ ged by le@@ aks from the Spr@@ ün@@ gli Con@@ fis@@ erie , in Business Class passenger Sho@@ gg@@ i von Lin@@ dt and Economy Class scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
on the short track , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y distri@@ butes both in Business and Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes into the niche in &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot;
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ years gr@@ unge era ( when the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter turned the sketch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to greater things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well not only because of its absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a talking dose of vegetables spoken by H. J@@ on Benjamin ) .
by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ag - middle aged actors playing hor@@ ny kids , who will grow up - they still managed to regain the last part of the weather .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults playing adults , is less emo@@ tionally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the casting principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character sticks through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another mad @-@ evil plot that Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ done impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it is a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons sub lip of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is like an old cra@@ cker .
it &apos;s the moments of accidental del@@ u@@ sions that could heat this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches what I accept as his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band debut of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Amazon is reminiscent of another kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its east vs. west w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka with Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director exists : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the road of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alo@@ gues are syn@@ ced by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an M@@ ask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
there are six long episodes , and the com@@ edy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was re@@ arranged to a smaller length , could better supply its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef are constantly visiting the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imagined Communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a for@@ age for a ban@@ quet .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with theirs .
beat the drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police managed to beat the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zwald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office Kon@@ stanz wed@@ ged on Friday .
15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 and issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials ensured greater amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand euros .
at the time of the same ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects of Italy .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators took part in the campaign .
a total of over 300 polic@@ emen were deployed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organised drug crime , heavy violence , attempted murder , and rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organised drug trade in the south German area .
between the public prosec@@ utor in Con@@ stance and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore the big effort was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
the aim of the investigation was mainly Italian nationals with a close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
Weise testi@@ fies great gaps in the register of foreigners
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the country @-@ centric register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in the case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned us in an analysis published by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the register , ten million people with foreign citizenship are reported in the register , including around 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
according to this , the data is managed by approximately 600 Länder authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been adequately maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and no longer should appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data inputs can significantly slow down processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the statistics on sufficient people , EU citizens are also included who don &apos;t have to travel at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such false directives , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led to a distorted debate on how to deal with exc@@ uses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with children under 16 years of age if they came from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this paper , it is said that the BA@@ MF again performs such procedures &quot; regarding families with children - with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , according to the newspaper , referring to the difficult situation on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees arriving at first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the immig@@ rant country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post is now writing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy have given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) considered these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back there within the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the female speaker of the left @-@ wing fraction , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children thre@@ aten un@@ lawful detention conditions and a threat to child welfare in the Italian asylum system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood from Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach has already provided blood don@@ or service to other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were honored on Friday .
all of them are Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who meanwhile donated 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , at the meeting of the council , the congregation gener@@ ously acknowled@@ ges willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our body is created for it and we pay respect for the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , even more un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the District Church leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the preserved foods are broken down into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by this way , three persons could already benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher told of the actions carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K Regional Team Leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the change to the theatre house obviously led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ lau@@ rel were among the majority don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations .

Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation on an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it kept the interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the policy makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members to increase in this month , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and 1.6 % for 2018 , and warned that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .
but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to raise the inflation tigh@@ tened by the Bre@@ x@@ it and said that credit costs might have to rise in the financial markets more than expected .
the members also voted to withdraw a part of the M@@ amm@@ ut economic stimulus which was issued a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it is said that it is now expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - at 115 billion pounds sterling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after deciding on the interest rate , the bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to strain consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the rate of interest , it reiter@@ ated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat larger &quot; scale than the markets would expect .
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this year and next year are expected to rise by 1.9 % to 1.7 % in May .
it maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to these news against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision on no change will come after the latest dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened rising expectations on interest rates and GDP grew from 0.2 % in the second quarter to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to lie at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the end of the year .
the recent inflation forecast gave little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by rising inflation and minor wage increases , as the sharpen@@ ing becomes worse at first before it becomes better .
she added that in the next few years monetary policy cannot &quot; prevent the coming of income , &quot; but she added that wages will recover significantly at the end of their three @-@ year forecast .
the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which will compensate for a part of lower consumption expenditure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes one year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the shock@@ ing EU vote provo@@ king the sin@@ king of the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully reach prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final verdict on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % last month in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said this was expected and will put them on again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bank said that the transgres@@ sion in proportion to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entirely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of recent swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders tend to search for businesses and end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages finish , and many with extra @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be 10,000 people as a controversial HIV drug
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trans@@ form@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight in front of the High Court in September . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ position pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now provided by the Health Service about a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite claims that the local authorities should finance it .
the cart@@ on announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National A@@ ids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described it as a &quot; crucial moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable people to register and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in April 2018 in the whole of England .
pre@@ texts pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV supplements taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infectious areas .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medication in the body of a person is present to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for the treatment are gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and persons with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable candidates will be identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will sign £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to evaluate the entire potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical specimen as it is used in a large scale .
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges facing hum@@ ankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National A@@ ids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded trial in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on H@@ od@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how trans@@ form@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are HIV @-@ infected , and that it will contribute to stopping the spread of HIV in society a step closer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , res@@ ized in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and an mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel factory is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us over@@ looks the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it work longer .
in the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that when you push the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here , they have succeeded in increasing the floor space and at the same time using high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which can help create emotional ties in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square footage of some standard in something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you might decide to not leave this .
brothers struggle for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two decades later , after its Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute over one of the biggest real estate markets of Victori@@ as worth more than $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how her property and her assets should be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 .
the West@@ co Jeans initially created je@@ ans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos; portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - described by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - roughly two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul approximately one third .
a court case states that this means that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars .
the breakdown of real estate and cash has been a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers now also struggle for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to in@@ compet@@ ently manage some possessions .
in an early affair submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs are in the case , with hundreds of pages with affir@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and law firms held by both parties .
Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy farmers and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950 &quot; s and bought a shop in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they took advantage of the security to purchase the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans of the family .
Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co when he was the High School in my last years when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on her property ben@@ ign to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , with Col@@ in claims that Mark had paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million in leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul tells &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in was held back very well , although he was a former AF@@ L member and after a biography from Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV star in 2015 .
Fair@@ fax Media got in contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw up our family name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father did not want Paul and me to end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to limit the Pres@@ idency &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico states that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course .
here is a piece by repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , on his first working day with executive staff , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House that he wanted to repair : poor information coming into the hands of the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly said that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship to television stretches back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was angry because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former electoral advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February facing Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keeping Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter custom under control , according to six ex @-@ election campaig@@ ners , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit has ever been &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
maybe these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know - that Tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets would have even more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump did not send .
if his employees have managed it a few times to keep trouble from him , their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently prevented von Tr@@ ump &apos;s controversy .
a part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting dump material that possibly promotes their views of the world .
Poli@@ tico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to supply doub@@ t@@ ful information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former slu@@ dge officials say that pumping like a volcano can react to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and that he insi@@ sts on finding out where these come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ci@@ ously accused the president of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ tw@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ateur , Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to &quot; be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for har@@ ass@@ ment or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced er@@ ron@@ eous alleg@@ ations and rev@@ oked them in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and started ques@@ tioning employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ smith added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work that Tr@@ ump is receiving . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most searched criminal receives post from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped .
the police all over Europe send ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals in this summer .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after heavy criminals are naturally not known , references from the population are hoped and asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , Euro@@ pol wrote about the action following the winter on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences would have shown that many volati@@ le refugees are hiding at holiday destinations , called Euro@@ pol .
one has put together 21 post@@ cards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times , has been viewed .
36 of the online orders could be det@@ ained so far , at least eleven of them due to clu@@ es after the publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire range &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with a few decided travelers at war feet , who have tra@@ ded a tren@@ ch drawn by the community to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road called Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their invasion .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pushed its vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry inhabitants have pushed the advice of Soli@@ hull , saying that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous person said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They moved there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council needs to be forced by shame to implement it , as it was useless in dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back .
more arrived last night , probably even more today . &quot;
she added , &quot; The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding a long brief@@ ing to protect its parks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council can &apos;t even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a resident who did not want to be called said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of this trav@@ eller just to be lo@@ oted from another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for Soli@@ hull , said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the stream brook Road and work together with Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls police . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them going as soon as possible .
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police , by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located in Birken@@ hof
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located in the former Hotel Birken@@ hof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently undergoing renovation and is to be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Birken@@ hof by the then Ambiente Manager company l@@ t@@ d. on April 13 , 2014 , approximately 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income by the tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building was offered to the District Office as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Council of the congregation .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s Lord Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious people interested in the house at that time .
he was to be right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ Hotels with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ wal@@ ern , acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ wal@@ ern and one in Bad Men &apos;s al@@ b .
they are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , building sh@@ utt@@ les are standing in front of the entrance for quite some time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out .
the floors were torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs were removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and meeting room are part of the equipment .
it is not to be positioned at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an up@@ scale downtown level , sh@@ aver emphasizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already conducted talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause .
the city &apos;s ideas are the same as those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
asked for the amount of investment Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define exactly .
under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the external systems are also brought forward , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace is created which will be accessible from the restaurant that is public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : us special agent sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Sonder@@ kom@@ mitt@@ ler Robert Mu@@ eller was said to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee has recorded work in the past weeks , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with reference to people familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had wi@@ dened and intensified his investigation .
the station CN@@ N reported that there were already the first invitations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence services have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time in target@@ ing the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations there are to be several men who acted as advis@@ ers to the Republi@@ cans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller took a closer look at more and more dr@@ um@@ ps of private and business environment .
a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote , a few weeks ago , that the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator Tr@@ ump personally moved to the centre and searched for the accus@@ ation whether the President could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair .
the main purpose of Grand Jury is to examine this evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide if charges are to be charged .
Grand j@@ uries are therefore also called the Ank@@ le Clips .
mostly they are switched on when dealing with bigger and controversial cases .
the procedure always takes place behind closed doors .
the panel can also be turned on by the At@@ tor@@ ney General to invite individuals to the hearing under oath .
according to CN@@ N , invitations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , and was said to be in the report .
they should also provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ um@@ ps advis@@ ers and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner as well as his former election campaign boss Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in U.S. television that the implementation show that Mu@@ eller should not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charging of an accus@@ ation .
nevertheless , the implementation of the committee is the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Tr@@ ump .
amid the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the president used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the topic gives the Democrats an opportunity to &quot; feel good &quot; because they have nothing other than they can talk about . &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
but they usually work secretly , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any action that acceler@@ ates the work of the special agent in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair way &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FB@@ I chief James Com@@ ey told three times that not against the President .
there was no reason to believe that something had changed in this regard , and continued to explain it in the statement .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this ration@@ ale , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have been loud , he has hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey spoke in front of a Senate committee in June , Tr@@ ump asked him to stop the investigation against the former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator and its employees .
this triggered spec@@ ulation on whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to release .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the late President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the insist@@ ence of President of the Ministry of Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a move . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators presented legislation on Thursday , after which the special investig@@ ator could no longer be released so easily .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg powers in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the west ant@@ ar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has loos@@ ened itself from the scar@@ ce of Berlin by the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin .
this was announced by the Bre@@ mer@@ haven Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , which weighs about one tri@@ l@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably need two , three years until it is mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered in the past three decades .
there is no risk for human beings .
the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demoli@@ tion of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
in total , however , for some 30 years there has been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s of ice cream in the region , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers this could be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
it grows further and further into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
to the north of this ice shelf the balance of wa@@ xes and abor@@ tions was disturbed several years ago .
A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete schol@@ astic file there .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s are in danger , because the front edge has never pulled back as far as at present .
in addition , the ice plate is under tension and can be dis@@ integrated if one piece breaks at a key point .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level , as they float on the water and squee@@ ze ice as much water as it produces after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaci@@ ers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project to observe Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth biggest Sch@@ el@@ ow of Antar@@ c@@ tica with nearly 50,000 square kilometres .
at the junction from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural phenomenon and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists it is disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will now grow back in the long term and possibly come back in the long term , &quot; said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though these scientists do not lead the demoli@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many ice caps in the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades .
this long tip of the Antar@@ c@@ tica stretches to South America .
according to the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the rise in temperature has contributed to the decline .
in the last 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has been war@@ med around three degrees and therefore ranks among the areas in which the temperature increases the fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the personnel
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U calls on the employer to step out of the employers &apos; association in order to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the Krei@@ stag gained 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and officers work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now again , 17 trainees have left their first working day .
the teachers in the circle are obviously very sought after .
there were approximately 6@@ 20 applications for the places to be awarded this year .
nevertheless , the group still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present there are still 50 vac@@ ant positions in the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration , are sought among others .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the request of the parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to meet short @-@ term demands on skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage .
the overall concept should be oriented in@@ wards and externally , to show specific measures for newcom@@ ers and include an education offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems which you did not know before .
other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes a high number of employees who are absent from the service due to illness or age .
it is high time for action so that not even more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he had long since made a big surprise in the circle of chal@@ k when he publicly challenged the shortage of personnel and st@@ un@@ ned the other parties .
people want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow an exit from the municipal employers &apos; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfying solution here at short notice , the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should strive for a house tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials , when the public service charges the tari@@ ff for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently required exactly , increases or more money is only available when changing to a higher level that is oriented towards career years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up , in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law .
not least because of the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , coun@@ cill@@ or Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy ag@@ grav@@ ates the tone to NGO migrant rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they may not continue to do so unless they adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after Italian authorities had conf@@ is@@ cated a boat to the German aid organization &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to comment on the detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess all accus@@ ations that are currently being collected after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is assumed that its crew will take infl@@ atable migrants aboard , which will be delivered directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting occurred only 1,3 km off the Libyan coast , according to the file of the prosec@@ utor , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of being over@@ seen by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta have to have an Italian police officer who supervis@@ es their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or obstruc@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization is Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Minn@@ iti has said in the meantime that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives , and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate , to enjoy Tri@@ als and sights for four days .
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and Wine Festival of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour continued at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far over the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were again and again extended asc@@ ents , for which long tri@@ als were rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim for Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
again , the view point was reached at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wer@@ ed &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days a lot of al@@ timet@@ ers were announced again .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed healing sal@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
also Neu@@ stadt was controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometers and almost 4@@ 500 meters , the group got to know the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cultural .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga ge@@ os for e @-@ sport
will the sports stars in future be sitting in front of computer consoles , instead of fighting with wind and weather over the stadium racing ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long become a serious industry , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels included .
these have also recognised the first Federal Republic of Germany , which are increasingly involved in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two pro@@ s for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are many clubs going on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; next weekend , FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where gam@@ ers compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven are qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , in particular that young people still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially Asian .
with prominent E @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the German airline to Asia .
what is it all about ?
in the E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the soccer simulation FIFA are challenged at the competition level .
as in normal sports , Li@@ gen has long since become established in which the pro@@ s compete against each other .
and in Asia , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to it .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber has also long been dealing with the question .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classic sports - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , cognitive abilities require a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and rapid response .
professional gam@@ ers should not only train at the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but F@@ rob@@ atic also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot;
controls are difficult to carry out on online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing .
the scientist emphas@@ ises the highly integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
the players are on the way internationally , which is like a great global family , there are no intercultural obstacles .
a study by the Corporate Consulting Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth for E @-@ Sport .
in 2016 , 50 million Euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments .
sales tot@@ alled 130 million in three years .
this is little against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , e @-@ sport is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte @-@ consultants write . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries are already on the move .
major markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez take part in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ Wett@@ dler Uni@@ kr@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a lot happening in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a teaching subject , says F@@ rob@@ ber .
in the Netherlands and France , the soccer league soccer clubs , according to D@@ utt , are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; Germany lag@@ ged behind in the European comparison , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B managing committee R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
only to fall into nostal@@ gia and to clarify the old times is no longer enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company with the modern market at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ sed world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no need to keep in mind that only football stays the same as it has always been . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted of the lyrics that Con@@ rad Roy wants to commit suicide
a woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls to suicide .
Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted of forced killing by Con@@ rad Roy in June , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ con@@ sol@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his vocation .
she was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in his eyes , folded hands and facing down@@ wards as she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she showed no regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible thing she depl@@ ores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Ju@@ dge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find that her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even her mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no day on which I don &apos;t get the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I want him to be proud of me and how I go with everything . I try to be there for eternity , in spite of all my pain , for his sisters , &quot; that is to say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the realisation that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer this single person with whom I was together every day since my birth is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ter revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hang up , jump from a building , walk yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the moments before his suicide it wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the fall by some press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
one of the few who defended Car@@ ter belonged to Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted of murder of her British co @-@ hab@@ itation in Italy in 2007 , before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves sympathy and help , not jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er were to be seen , he stopped his split bond .
&quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as a Bavarian captain .
good , the stand could have been better than at 0 : 2 vs SS@@ C Naples .
but I was able to interpret the sign from the coach .
not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f consisting of young people , de@@ but@@ aries and straight out of the holiday .
sugar is most likely to be distributed to those people who want to keep a good mood .
those who have been chosen to take the heritage of L@@ ah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ e said , &quot; That &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ atten@@ ed over the field as a mini @-@ l@@ ame .
to the right , this is his position , the white band@@ age at the arm did its rest .
and at all Kim@@ e worked in this grid formation as the one who is able to take the ru@@ dder into the hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ bund@@ led tro@@ upe .
he had a view for the whole , while many others were busy with themselves .
Vi@@ dal thus , to re@@ play his missing fitness ( collap@@ sed barely ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on the devil come out to the accompli@@ sh@@ ments of the Asia journey ( also only partially ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le do not drop neg@@ atively in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot .
after all , this worked out very well .
Sü@@ le ran along with Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both acted confi@@ dently .
the nam@@ ably occupied Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le tried to succeed in playing the game a few times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the outcome was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not like we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance in his debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also brought up for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual this Bayern @-@ World is still for the new arri@@ vals , one looked at the game following the game .
for example Ru@@ dy did not give one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determines six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said good@@ bye to some cris@@ p statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
after all , he does not have to teach the new .
Al@@ aba Mo@@ tiv@@ ates Ec@@ st@@ asy La@@ dies

Austria &apos;s most famous foot@@ b@@ aller was announced shortly before the game about Twitter and the Ö@@ FB @-@ La@@ dies wanted all the best .

company content with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected in more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy on the T V request - and simultaneously blame the old ministers .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Fir@@ ms ( V@@ TU ) says , &quot; Wis@@ sing takes up the wishes of the economy , which has all blocked Lem@@ ke . &quot;
the biggest down@@ turn sees Nat@@ alia in the infrastructure policy : the gap of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 is expected to stand .
the West housing Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Marketing Plan , also plays a role in the plans of the country .
the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says Mini@@ steri@@ al spokes@@ woman Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees this as a sign for supporting regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier , as suggested by Wis@@ sing , aims at the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German vine exports which has been sag@@ ging for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
the Chamber of Crafts Trier has added an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
provided is a premium of 1000 Euro for the passing championship exam and 2500 euro , if graduates within ten years after the master scho@@ oling are self @-@ sufficient .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road construction is quick to find facts , at the same time it lacks the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , head of the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce of Trier .
to date , only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers who wish to recru@@ it bis@@ cuits in state @-@ owned mobility .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be assigned to external offices .
according to the calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the CD@@ U faction , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , refers to more than 20 million euros less than proposed by country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank Nat@@ us also anticip@@ ates a country concept , as the shortage of skilled workers in the region wants to fix .
the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies had assessed grid supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey only with a score of 3,@@ 4 .
they compl@@ ained about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ downs .
E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , former Minister of Economy , is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become a president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months of in@@ consist@@ encies she already cleared the field .
Audi is supposed to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW told that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW Group CEO said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as driving restrictions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to ban or restrict . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with regulations for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ it diesel engines , are regarded as carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the costs for car manufacturers , systems for the neutr@@ alisation of exhaust gases em@@ itted by diesel vehicles are also increasing , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of har@@ ming the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the faults of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called switch @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but return to normal driving conditions .
several Volkswagen Emplo@@ ye@@ es were indic@@ ted in the United States , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been extended .
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could seriously affect Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer is dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the win of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft through Munich , which has a special message , drives on Saturday morning .
when it comes to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and that is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building &apos;s bure@@ au wants to clarify .
on the raft you can see a big Inf@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter .
it shows a Müll@@ berg .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a public campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar should be sharpen@@ ed as a protective wild flow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer , the raft sailed over the Is@@ ar and again this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll @-@ n@@ oses and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ on dra@@ fts@@ men , the bulb n@@ oses of his characters are his trademarks .
also with 85 Argent@@ inians are still drawing and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he presented himself as an artist for congrat@@ ul@@ atory cards - what frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he once said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist of cities was inspired .
large , round Mor@@ di@@ llo figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits at the drawing table , works daily for almost ten hours .
through cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , T @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks , its dro@@ ll figures continue to spread widely worldwide .
for six years he has also been working on a carto@@ on and a TV series with his figures .
the main character in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thous@@ and@@ ler as a counter@@ part .
for the first time , his figures in the 3D film , which are to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
for this reason , he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without words .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence at risk of climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
la@@ ven@@ der is due to the conditions that are reminiscent of d@@ rought and insect @-@ borne insects , which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert in the C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which in spring brought much less rain and much more in the autumn .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small ci@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather , there are many of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is much on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse , said : &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are taken into account include a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to d@@ rought .
the little town of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ in@@ gian town of R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 year anniversary this year .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist emphasizes the growing threat to Mexico
the staff of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ urs usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting about the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security .
they told them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists wanted to discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a plaque on the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and stomach feelings suff@@ ice .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s pay@@ roll or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there are no breaks of violence , and while the bodies are pil@@ ing up throughout the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to res@@ ig@@ ned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter are their editors and their inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ sius , co @-@ founder of J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ sius building . two repor@@ ters in the 19@@ 30s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was set up in 2010 in order to deal with the cases of journalists , it only initiated two criminal proceedings under the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders connected with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely tried in court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ sia , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ con@@ sol@@ able and even though the terrain is even more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of safety has little use , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s very foolish to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we di@@ str@@ ust everybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 Val@@ dez was leaving the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ sius in the capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth Flow . &quot;
the sho@@ oter stopped in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and ex@@ tradition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the country &apos;s bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields , as rival fac@@ tions struggle here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that every day one or more people are shot on the street in Sin@@ alo@@ a or that the grav@@ eyard is full of decorated , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace , &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ sius , has broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first of all , in February the publication of an interview with Damas@@ co Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for its own security after conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ urs and sold 50 US dollar particip@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug ad@@ diction problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation because of the cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
repor@@ ters loved publishing hard @-@ hit studies without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ sia , she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for her reporting in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; by the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he volunte@@ ered to be sc@@ ared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take over the task that you as a journalist is entitled to - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ? why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ urs @-@ Team miss Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is His love for the routine his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced her to question her own ass@@ umptions about how to do her work best and remain alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret start and landing strips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trouble is , the editor of Ri@@ odo@@ tin Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be fo@@ ol@@ ed ... and then the thing happened to J@@ avier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ tin met for safety training , no mobile phones suddenly were allowed . days before it became known that sp@@ y@@ ware , which is sold solely to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ sia in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size neighborhood of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , whom the Gover@@ nor himself was not trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the repor@@ ters went to the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ sius made three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous maker Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an Ex@@ pos@@ é about state expendi@@ tures concentrated on the home town of the Gover@@ nor .
and there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows , that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , dominated almost the whole century all political planes .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ profile cases of corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous events in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Ch@@ apo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few months earlier , readers had seen the Val@@ dez column as the best informed resource on the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we used to have known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was turned into a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers , prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez took a few signs and went the next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist for the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador N@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is his .
in the whole country , journalists have become ph@@ one@@ tics by writing in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on walk@@ ways and constructions .
on that day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and killing them because they told the truth .
she has since been asked to be re @-@ divided by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated objec@@ tivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , involved government officials and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ different society &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs but also on the order of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ um 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and civil servants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut , &quot; Ram@@ i@@ rez said .
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kartell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones lay beside their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue what El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly contacted the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page titled &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled their country or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben E@@ spin@@ osa , who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who lag behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , admitted that drug traffi@@ cking was frigh@@ tening him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico is going to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ urs sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , when suddenly all their phones began to h@@ um .
19 confirmed dead were left by a series of arch@@ ers with ri@@ bel@@ ties and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan seaside resort .
the war continued to escal@@ ate , as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the cur@@ b edge , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ sius over mobile phones .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens pil@@ ed up nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
if they were frigh@@ tened at all , they did not show it .
under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ urs followed his foot@@ steps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you keep thinking about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to do@@ dge his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a frigh@@ tening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible h@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain workers have been preserved so well that experts have described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so well received that they could even notice that his fl@@ ak@@ y skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best preserved din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
its incredibly well preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he p@@ itted on March 21 , 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine , near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something that was out of place by the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 l@@ bs ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy soil .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a moving tank , probably was threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technology known as a mat@@ ing , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to blend better into its surroundings and ev@@ ade its enemies , say experts suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million year old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
the astonishing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered bank@@ rupt@@ cy , a widespread defense method in animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was dark@@ er than their under@@ side .
although the sh@@ ad@@ owing is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of today living animals .
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by enough pressure through car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals , who use the sh@@ ad@@ owing - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable to prey , indicating that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es have been of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was red @-@ brown .
scientists continue to study the animal for indications of his life , including his con@@ served intestinal contents , to find out what he ate as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the se@@ abed .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as south fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much far@@ ther inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved sk@@ inn@@ ed skin , but remains intact in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; Brown said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just look a little with your eyes , you might almost believe he &apos;s asleep . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous time was a time when huge thermal di@@ odes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , who lived Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he p@@ itted on March 21 , 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine , near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the best preserved din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long spi@@ kes that were ra@@ ging from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swe@@ pt through the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open ocean .
but the underwater hull of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the porch of the house is still covering hol@@ pri@@ t ar@@ mor@@ ed plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rare as a win in the lot@@ tery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upward .
I can count the scales at his sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
violent accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , kilometres @-@ long st@@ on@@ e- and g@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) around 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
according to the police , at 17.00 o &apos;clock between the connecting sites of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( administrative district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , almost 30 vehicles , including trucks , crashed into each other during a thunder@@ storm .
there are no indications of the exact number of injured layers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a matter of light to moderate injuries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large provision of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
a ten @-@ kilometre return au formed in the direction of Munich .
as reported by an A@@ Z repor@@ ter , there were also massive disabilities on the opposite track - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade was the hall@@ mark of the vehicle operators who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive fin@@ es .
shortly after 18 : 45 a.m. a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : it is not surprising that one sits in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and just has an ingeni@@ ous thought .
and then : buff@@ ered .
the conductor comes and w@@ akes an un@@ sweet@@ ly or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the paper@@ less ticket control .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take your seat and use it to vali@@ date the ticket .
currently , a test operation runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer comes , we extend it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available at many other highway routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a track spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ticket de@@ valuation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without the conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use it , however , some conditions need to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
you also have to buy it via the app of the train , the DB Navigator , which is anyway the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : one climbs into the train , calls his ticket to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for electronic de@@ valuation appears with the test customers .
the train companions receive a message on their mobile devices that the passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
if the train driver arrives at No@@ .@@ y on the ticket inspection , he knows that there is a passenger with an already cancelled online ticket .
so one can continue to sleep , work on , keep quiet .
check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers .
&quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train crew , please check the DB Navigator for yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Network Marketing Director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are among the biggest nu@@ is@@ ances .
because often you do not have all the documents you need for the de@@ valuation of online tickets in any case .
either the credit card or the identity card is missing or a document you have to assign .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling their own tickets and taking the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that applies only to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same track are not yet available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to its core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a mail from someone from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as no one else posted the information on her feed , she joined Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly ret@@ ou@@ ted on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was about to live the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought .
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she put her cell phone off to return later in the evening to twe@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos of police and people shou@@ ting , and of a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who wore a shield with the inscription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman said his ri@@ f@@ le and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l to her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shi@@ vers .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she got her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11th .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance resulting from the perspective of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a matching crown , the two discussed a conversation that they had &quot; over the black experience and the black state &quot; countless times before this morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take them with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be re@@ ared in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves .
even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be doing her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the Police Department , which became a camp site when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped them to pass on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism changed totally after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis president of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black commun@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it &apos;s all come . &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by inn@@ um@@ erable cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently said in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt occup@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks or talks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , how these people are portra@@ yed , because I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ells &apos; experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah guide , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells &apos; life as she falls in love and marry her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , laugh@@ ing when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and the de@@ human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have supported the movement overall , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said , &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts .
black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ tive type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film due to her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person that vibr@@ ated this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no coincidence , even though it was at the front , because in a life at these junc@@ tions a black , gay woman stands as much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the ra@@ cial connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels oblig@@ ated to this memory , since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support one another .
we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV readers discuss bit gallery &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bit gallery moves people even though it hasn &apos;t been built for a long time yet .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been spl@@ itting the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
cold the topic hardly leaves one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while some say to the bit gallery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That would be great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no man needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mad ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the advoc@@ ates build that a gallery will attract more customers into the city , including the rest of the shops , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will ble@@ ed .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the grounds on which the farmers market hall stands in which 13 directly market their products .
with the beginning of the construction work will be finished .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sim@@ one Room : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have bought for many years almost a week in the farmers market hall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women always liked very much .
we also discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
we would wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing takes place in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low with the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping bags in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think this is superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough of that in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important for us to keep at least the market hall .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive in addition .
as you can see , shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , because the r@@ ents there are often not portable to a retail@@ er .
too bad , specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably also disappear . &quot;
Wolf fan@@ pack : &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the farmers market hall stand during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery is actually coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does the gh@@ ost &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bit @-@ Galerie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already manage to distribute all stores from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
and no one needs a shopping center that stands empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market hall there is no place thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I think - sen@@ sel@@ ess building projects in Bit@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which resem@@ ble almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly - which hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 Portra@@ its were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Haar@@ etz , who were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st banned a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after publi@@ cally classified diplomatic messages about Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August means A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ woman and pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted from Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , how anyone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways they can interpret and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward but openly talked about identification as a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted of 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , sitting in the man@@ ing obviously un@@ well sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just about the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in this , the artist produced portraits of foreigners from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ ts and ch@@ ewing gum , by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look .
that was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a portrait of a DNA .
the artist and her imprisoned M@@ use became an un@@ equal Bri@@ eff@@ re@@ unden , who in the course of two years exchanged several letters .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated com@@ ics &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; which fores@@ aw a future in which the president would change the judgment of Over@@ seas and would be able to see the exhibition in person .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would be a welcome type of happy coincidence .
there is also now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to fl@@ are up the rigid spl@@ its that he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about all these things after the strange timing , she said &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing asked with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is endow@@ ed with a heart ) , an end to the &quot; automatic de@@ frag@@ mentation , whose foundation was gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by including the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as surprisingly similar , at least in biological matter , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully bring along is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so it &apos;s 30 of these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle .
it shows Mann@@ ing , how she appears in the hand of the United States bre@@ wing bar@@ racks like King Kong with a hands @-@ free telephone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they put your words in the cold , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not yet personally seen the exhibition - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , she will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room , by her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ons , who assemble themselves like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also target @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor at the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for killing
a nationwide human race is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University , who are sought out as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the records of the Cook County Court .
the documents say Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died , 26 , after several stit@@ ches .
a common warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene , and det@@ ec@@ tives examine the stit@@ ches as murder while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
he has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ onder@@ s , the Vice @-@ President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that they are now undergoing a review and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal affair examined by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is a Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker from the University and Somer@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any manner possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said that he insist@@ ently calls on susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs and our efforts to locate them strengthen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police got a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , said that something happened in apt 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that they were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team at Grand Plaza has published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the backdrop of the victim , exploring a variety of motives , including a possible home incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA Road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA Road@@ map has been updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s schedule to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for the re @-@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the Organisation &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria listed in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigations approved by the WA@@ DA by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in reference to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ kos &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v announced problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one pre@@ fers to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the WA@@ DA by the implementation of dop@@ ing checks in Russia in November 2015 .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the organisation in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; in order to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for the time being
this divided the company groups .
it was a mere precau@@ tion that no health impair@@ ment could be assumed , it was said in the notification .
from now on only eggs are likely to be delivered to Al@@ di , which were demon@@ stra@@ bly tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ous anti @-@ lice inf@@ ant .
Al@@ di wants to create clarity and transparency with its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company do not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has called people out of the outside for help .
a new breed of human resources start @-@ ups is on growth to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , to offer special groups and demo@@ graphics groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t won .
in addition to snap surveys and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most gri@@ ev@@ ances and what managers have low approval results - so that you can re @-@ bore , why .
companies come to see that they must stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next person involved in sc@@ and@@ als , since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken will be punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , following the financial engineering site Let &apos;s Talk pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , who helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber F@@ ever@@ thing in Mis@@ kol@@ re@@ dit .
Conan has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
over recently , u@@ ber has registered as a client .
like G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent lets companies send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which employees can report bad behavior .
and when the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has gr@@ asp@@ ed the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company finds its employees badly treated or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and law@@ suits , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
rug@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has deployed Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and processes and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now , as the company Con@@ ver@@ cent uses , problems that have previously been hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair inter@@ ns - can be identified and addressed more quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance given by Venture Capital investors who supported both startups .
cent received $ 10 million in funding in February by companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer &apos;s venture partner and brought his total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only assignments .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company , feel that their voices are heard and that the work you do is worth it , they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience on Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors can reach returns when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
when the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take measures .
in fact , when a company asks staff for your feedback , it may have a expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , it can grow dis@@ appointments and demo@@ tiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4.000 ideas , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow the staff , ask yourself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , saving .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights into its employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bond of workers in a sector that is known for high sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you lose customers too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose your business .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the bru@@ ins
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players conver@@ se on one side of the team &apos;s new training fields .
some have pulled off their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled at the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour practice before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the boys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brother @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore the first three trainings of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as played six seasons in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of formal playing preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supported the change of control of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them for three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ken further , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will stop its practice as soon as the camp is over , which is not an easy task , given the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already been ki@@ cked off with foot@@ balls that clean up a net behind a door@@ post .
players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then hire them to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts inspection in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with error messages to third parties and then display their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company stated in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to detect possible errors and to send them to fac@@ t@@ checks that may display results of the fact test from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan that social media networks should be punished if they fail to eliminate h@@ aci@@ dic post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook announced in a separate statement in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts sc@@ rut@@ iny will be launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the understanding which stories of third parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that Facebook continues to be testing its feature on the &quot; related article &quot; and working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages .

in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher during the 1970 and 1980 &apos;s .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said bol@@ dly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ck May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : in 2014 he wrote &apos; Dead Man &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb print on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
and letters always smell smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were there as well .
Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome &quot; ) this seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape fle@@ ets , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust only received full access until 2006 , when the last hei@@ ress , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristoc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards representing what possessed it : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch that fought two families .
guys , let everything go your way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se themselves in the English story , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant revol@@ t began in this area and I thought an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it patent , whom the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l from the 18th century is portra@@ yed who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; favourite family of Scot@@ ties : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be quite a du@@ n , always making loans and spending money for things they could not afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men solved their debt crisis by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking boys , with a talent to advertise land@@ lady . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle , Rho@@ des is looking for other unique write experiences
he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be done with dam@@ n life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : more than 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle veiled in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the revelation of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honne@@ f launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team headed by Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and slogan at home until Thursday .
at the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
or ? , &quot; ask the makers of the campaign yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorf chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their website free of charge yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we , as Bad Honne@@ f , are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it goes on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ encomp@@ assing promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Honne@@ f will cost a mid @-@ five @-@ digit amount for its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on Pen@@ sion@@ ings and Promotions in officers &quot; cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance , a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the general staff , as in the past , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the Prime Minister , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the consultations .
as a result , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in abundance .
the government is pulling the re@@ ins in the military .
although Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed .
since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan 169 has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as a re@@ pul@@ ler of the attempted put@@ sch attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who allegedly participated in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara since that week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely clean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
at the end of February , the &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; newspaper published an article entitled &quot; Dis@@ comfort in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ line ban for soldiers , wrote the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in any case , the large pur@@ ges in the army and the security forces continue .
in the middle of July , another 7@@ 3@@ 95 government ear@@ ners were fired by decree , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan was t@@ aming the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the real masters of the country .
three times they appe@@ aled to their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform targets of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is target@@ ing an Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer , who sought asylum from fear of persecution in foreign countries after the attempted coup attempt , would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not allow Nato to be cold .
anyway , after the pur@@ ges there is doubt about the readiness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the Green Card rules
there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media .
it envis@@ ages lowering the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by changing the way citizens from other countries will issue Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to san@@ i@@ tise route for race foot shuttle
over the past few months we have been argu@@ ing about the future of the race track shuttle - now it is going to go very quickly .
at the end of the year , at the ailing route , on which the tourist railway drives , is to be built .
in order to secure the future of the race shuttle service in the long term , construction work on the track will start again this year according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; with the decision to further order and san@@ i@@ tise the track Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country comm@@ its itself to this connection particularly for tourism , &quot; explained Klaus moment@@ l , Secretary of State , on Friday in Er@@ furt .
the costs for the repair of the route were estimated at about 2.5 million euros .
this sum represents 75 percent of the country .
the contract , on whose basis the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , is currently being fin@@ alized , declared expi@@ ation .
the ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen railway as operator are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company is closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the race car shuttle will be ordered regularly in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is an especially popular rail link between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
in the course of a pilot operation , it has been tested over the past few months , whether the route is used by enough people to order them regularly in the future .
the track is also very steep in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about
just as you thought that 2017 may not become even cra@@ zier , a new report comes on the technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes indeed .
sex robots are currently a big deal .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robo@@ tics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robo@@ tics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of FR@@ R , we must start taking their Ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; people are making fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the publication of his new report .
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot to his convic@@ tions and choose everything from the sight of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
for example , the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot enables users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; who conve@@ ys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as much as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses True Compan@@ ion &apos;s website .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has her mo@@ ods , quite like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in tune &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex @-@ robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female features , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape if one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , alarm one the most .
on his site compared True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex toy .
their emergence and increasing refin@@ ement point to something dark@@ er and deeper in our culture , towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notices their rising popularity , they nevertheless remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what escap@@ es from the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive in relation to the spirit of the time in which we live .
and many people are not wei@@ rd or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots come up at a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened all over the world , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted women .
the most dre@@ ad@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand @-@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the intri@@ cate body and the st@@ out eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it doesn &apos;t feel like a big leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical lik@@ eness to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( al@@ beit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human@@ ely aware that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots do not represent real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can &apos;t separate yourself from your companion or just go away .
they have no mediation or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that might distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the 2017 Rede@@ mption : ma@@ ids
dr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense of man
it has become a tr@@ ump @-@ wisdom of the tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the U.S. voters have also split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we are all ost@@ ensi@@ bly critici@@ zing all of us to burst out our filter bags .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps to bring families together .
I mention this because my cous@@ in , a left @-@ looking poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republi@@ cans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with whom she had fought for decades on account of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
around the dining table that is certainly a good thing , but it falls in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dec@@ lining effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens will not be dump@@ ed one day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is , however , a more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Republi@@ cans of the right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison with his standards as the notion of reason@@ abl@@ eness .
I find myself affected by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to dump in fact seem to be a very mild criminal off@@ ence .
when Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of the Republi@@ cans must be spiritually healthy to qualify as an un@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our kids to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ ry and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely glo@@ omy and the per@@ pen@@ sive music conve@@ ys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not over the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is in fact not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the them@@ ed pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage counts not - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park @-@ car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , as two two @-@ year @-@ old , 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given it the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it .
on the other hand , during this week in a department store , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood horri@@ bly angry while I was tired of the experience of submitting my credit card to five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pist@@ ori@@ us , for the second time , left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts on his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to which he was tor@@ tured to the prison authorities in one case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first death sentence .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing it several times through a door to the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a ni@@ gh@@ tly intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time to the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , which they say is too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Criminal Inves@@ tigation Agency said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ cler@@ ks were dischar@@ ged from sho@@ ot@@ ers and E@@ stu@@ en@@ ho@@ fen to the holidays and to the secondary schools .
three of the pupils will go to secondary school in the future , four to secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 pupils of the four classes , led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle rising up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the scre@@ ened band headed a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The eagle in the chicken &apos;s yard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and let it bro@@ ods from its chi@@ ckens .
instead of a chicken dish , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of it broke , the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and s@@ wore .
after that the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young go@@ ck@@ les that bore the cylinders to the bet .
the eagle stands for integration , said school manager An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te .
the kit@@ ten is different from the other young ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
she wished each town@@ spe@@ ople that he feels accepted in his new school .
there was a thank@@ sgiving to the colleagues , former school director Michael Müller , who repeatedly ski@@ ps in instruc@@ tional bott@@ len@@ ecks , and the parents &quot; representatives .
the ch@@ ick @-@ time is over , explained teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher .
she will leave her students very hungry after two years of instruction , because it was a really great time .
finally , they could rely on the four @-@ cler@@ k .
at the end all students explored a song of summer time and holiday season .
in this context , great joy broke out among the children .
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camp@@ ings in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .
on the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal refugees , including the two Bulg@@ arians , was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia by the police .
on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway .
the State Department reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have ag@@ grav@@ ated control over the free camp and present to anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls continue throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected must now know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel @-@ drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
an overview of the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the emission characteristics of cars of emission scale Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ ted from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin , ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the software updates negotiated will be voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swiss Federal Office of Technology ( KBA ) has ordered their retro@@ fitting .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced swift implementation in the coming months , but not yet known as an exact date .
Daimler reported to write down any person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , that will be settled in its framework .
how long will the retro@@ fitting go over altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
the company &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen that the autom@@ akers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment up to now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
what do mot@@ ori@@ sts do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE reveals to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would be re@@ trac@@ ted , so S@@ met@@ anin .
does a massive price drop of Euro @-@ 4 cars now thre@@ aten ?

ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the hon@@ our@@ able .
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and join his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
this is why the award @-@ winning award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV shows is already announced to refra@@ in from attending the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ve them of the means - and this puts a strain on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use the talk with Tr@@ ump to make her view clearer .
the Kennedy @-@ Center named after former President John F. Kennedy is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
former award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Urban Builder , reti@@ res next year .
the place is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare .
since 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he conve@@ ys in the press talk .
he reports about varied but also challenging tasks that await his successor .
at the same time , it is surprising that until now no application is required for the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
so - considering the regular periods of notice - should still be enough time for a famili@@ arization .
since Has@@ lach works as a Lower Building Law Authority for the Administr@@ ative Community , the applicant has to present the corresponding degrees .
because this function wants to keep the town in any case .
if it were no longer able to fill it , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but clos@@ eness to citizens is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who reports about a good working climate and good atmosphere between authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office some significant projects have accumulated , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park@@ ing@@ stand are about to be found .
the zig@@ z@@ ag bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed and the stadium renovation is still a topic .
the latter alone will be able to book with around 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is available for a city @-@ builder of great play @-@ space .
with Has@@ la@@ chs own farm and nur@@ sery can be re@@ acted flexibly in many ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the landsc@@ aping of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what fits in , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the reti@@ ring municipal building master emphasizes .
in any case , the City Engineer has a high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is the builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the event of support and coordination he can count on long@@ standing employees : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been with us for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker wants his successor for a long time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere , but also for the further design of the city .
according to the town of Has@@ lach , anyone who wants to inherit Roland W@@ acker should be able to present a completed study as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor with the subject of architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of construction planning and construction planning law .
the Municipal Building Department is subject to civil engineering , civil engineering , underground construction , administration of urban properties , municipal yard with building yard and urban gardening as well as the Lower Building Law Authority ( including historic monuments ) .
bike is thrown on lines : South railway line closed
according to the police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rators tos@@ sed the blue bike from the railway track transfer in the area of Le@@ oben Street ( B@@ 116 ) onto the lines .
these were badly damaged in such a way that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been looking for them since the night hours .
close to the scene there were witnessed a ros@@ ary sco@@ oter and a bike rider .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a sl@@ ump in Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch on AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator or the perpet@@ r@@ ator would have je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed himself and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the installation , as well as the delay of delay and the cost of rail @-@ replacement traffic , even pat@@ rons of the railway customers could come to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum is expected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages had been repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern rail track could be guided without any disabilities .
almost ten people had dropped out on Friday morning , two of them included correspondence .
freight trains did not drop , but they had delay .
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch , around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate can help to allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition affecting about 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the senior researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ines pat@@ rol in order to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hiding in the food will not penetrate into the body .
cells capable of tri@@ g@@ gering infections are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the equilibrium is too far towards inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
experiments have been found to detect a type of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice carrying a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ e encourages toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lie@@ us , if the same system also works with people .
the post @-@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was investigating a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was however separated , had not had this .
they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and found in six bacterial species , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but were missing in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria exer@@ ted on the immune system , the researcher L. reu@@ ter@@ i allowed to grow in a fluid and transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - onto im@@ mature immune cells isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in mice food , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han levels were hal@@ ved , the number of cells fell by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that humans have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells such as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han levels can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic committed a &quot; genius &quot;
at Manchester United , with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound signature from Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressed in the keeper &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched as they wanted .
however , matic was excluded from the pre @-@ preparation Asia tour of the blues and managed just 45 minutes , which admitted M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
along with M@@ atic also started Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho made his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted three other new obligations , but he insist@@ ed that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority obligations .
&quot; getting three out of four , I thank the club , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great pains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing had painted the sil@@ houette of a dre@@ am@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle to Washington State Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a dre@@ am@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind rot@@ ates : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , Social @-@ Democratic Prime @-@ Democratic Prime Minister always looked for Berlin with a certain concern .
the most important wish of the campaig@@ ners was not merely a fire from the party headquarters , but no head@@ winds from the League .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are observing the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Schulz from there since the beginning of the year has not been described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were cr@@ ates .
and one by one .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not go@@ vern confi@@ dently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Peter Tau@@ ber , Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber , the German editorial office ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising fac@@ tions of a Gre@@ ens de@@ pu@@ ties have over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the Parliament elections , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Federal Executive Officer Michael Kell@@ ner called on the apost@@ ate Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens MEP El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear distortion of the elec@@ torate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
El@@ ke T@@ westen must return her mandate immediately , &quot; said the Federal Executive Officer and campaign leader of the Green Party network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD campaig@@ ner gro@@ ans when the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is there after the transition of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U without their own government majority .
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD regional associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the misery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , no more , did the comrades so@@ o@@ the at his time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
then it became - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into stag@@ gering , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te flat@@ ly hau@@ led the party .
the comrades were lab@@ ori@@ ously re@@ trac@@ ted again in the weeks after that .
then , when they had just picked up new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next cr@@ ot@@ ch .
mayor O@@ la@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his Nim@@ bus at the weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communication he did everything wrong afterwards , which can be done wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust @-@ affair and its role in the Supervisory Board , Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister has stood in criticism for quite some time .
the average poll@@ s were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l always tried to set accents in the Con@@ federation in recent weeks .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin did not remain hidden from the comrades in the surroundings of Martin Schulz .
they let him give him , because they spoke of a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
at the same time Wei@@ l is not responsible for the party internal compul@@ sion of the Gre@@ ens of Lower Saxony .
and Schulz does not work at all .
at times the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed against the Gre@@ ens , and here especially the apost@@ ate parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ westen there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democratic , how Mrs. T@@ westen sets out her own career in the interests of all the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial office ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr@@ s T@@ westen is not elected as a direct candidate because of her personality but has been elected to the parliament by the state list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains about an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vot@@ er four years ago was clear : people made Stephan Wei@@ l as Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the SPD SPD as the top candidate to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties now fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he demanded clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments from CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for local nucle@@ us III
those who want to rehabil@@ itate their home in the years can soon get support from the country .
on Wednesday , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives informed city development on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler once again gave a review of what happened so far .
since 1991 , there have been a lot of refur@@ bish@@ ment areas .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the existing renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is ultimately important to promote interior development , not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , I received the information from the Regier@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Karlsruhe that there will be a refur@@ bish@@ ment area III .
the amount of funding amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500@@ ,000 euros would come from the country , the rest from the community .
how is a remedi@@ ation area created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will further investigate , as Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether interest exists in the planned area at all .
if necessary , the regional boundaries could then also be postpon@@ ed again .
on Wednesday evening , the jet@@ ty represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the Bund Project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the reconstruction would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
core of the program is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , i.e. per plot .
the renovation area would eventually be defined as a statute .
the licensing period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , the survey will only take place , within the framework of the participants participating in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December the deadline for punc@@ tu@@ ation should be carried out so that the restructuring can begin next year .
afterwards , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann declared that every Commun@@ e had to carry out the aforementioned investigations .
it is important to evaluate and decide the conditions of the urban development , when it is rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
there will also be a san@@ itation note in the land register for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come to his senses again and get a picture of the situation she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .
this is why there will be questionn@@ aires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and plot arc &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where it concerns the structural condition and the renovation prospects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and H@@ ousing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data on size , parti@@ tioning and residents of a residential space can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled out if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , please note that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures were not eligible for promotion .
Sch@@ in@@ dler still emphas@@ ised that the distribution of funds according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; func@@ tioned - whoever comes first , ad@@ mon@@ ishes first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to conclude , pictures of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Orts@@ kern II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a refur@@ bish@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip to enter house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has partner@@ ed with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ aes@@ thesi@@ ologist at Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed Z@@ 4 technology at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel .
white House adverti@@ sers cost thousands of tax@@ pay@@ ers
the White House decision to fly a nav@@ al helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American production last month will cost tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military service provided to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17th at the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter made in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was exhibited beside a Ma@@ ine yacht , a Wisconsin Fire Brig@@ ade and a For@@ kli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House Military Office requested the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the notes of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , the Deputy Military Commander of Aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the news showed that the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long it remained until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .
the note also adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the hours a second crew for the return flight would be required .
the original air@@ crew was in the helicopter during the event , while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time .
it was not clear from the records provided by TI@@ ME whether a second air@@ crew was required in the end .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
dat@@ as@@ ets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could viol@@ ate the provision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the command@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you were locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was marked by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was in progress in the Senate and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advantageous purposes , is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to request her use only for a photo operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential jet served in the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 countries which are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often carry out training flights in the Washington area around Washington and South La@@ wn to susp@@ end US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tr@@ ump in early July was on the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 practice land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted during the training needs of the crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers over@@ took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man for Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in setting up the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential run , and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event .
according to the US Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time , the White House press spokes@@ man , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the helicopter &apos;s use for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things this week , which are made in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to highlight that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump had inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire fighter .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before tri@@ cky task
the leader of the Second Tennis League ki@@ cks off at the stand@@ ly third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blau @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss joins the stand@@ alone Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V tomorrow from 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel .
despite five games still flaw@@ less , the leader of the Second Tennis League has gained the sense of reality .
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay in any case has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially on the post@@ erior positions I find the team very good . &quot;
imports from the high North above all ensure class and stability at the S@@ V in Düsseldorf .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ swivel ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good dose of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high North stands practically .
his debut for blue wh@@ ites could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ sson .
if the Fren@@ ch@@ man currently active in the chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella is not active for the Bundes@@ liga match , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) will be playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) for his first use in this season .
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo was yesterday with the White Russians An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el at the Ball .
he was also to be present in Kiel as well as Bo@@ tic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the Club at Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could again move into the team again .
if it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one of the Junior World Ran@@ king in January 2016 , someone from the trainer will fill the cad@@ re with Mari@@ us Z@@ ay .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when on Wednesday evening he signed his signature under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the congress concluded a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he argued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the US advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft plan is to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors of O@@ MV , who co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Project North Stream 2 together with other European companies , have been al@@ armed .
the dr@@ one backdrop is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early to estimate the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have had to bring the sanctions to life by executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked at which the group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is moved into the center of the Hit@@ row by Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which reveals Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars killer , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not over yet .
the seasons three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest vil@@ la@@ ins of the show .
with the third season the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organisation of the world &apos;s drug trade : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kartell .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ ac@@ ote ) is in New York .
in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns to J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Sil@@ vest@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will begin on September 1st .
roll back : the city provides 46 kitchen utensils
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table again .
with strong contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the city nur@@ series , the clock is turned back .
on 1 September the city Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of youth aid , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very happy . &quot;
cooking is still done outside the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies fresh Gek@@ o@@ ily chill@@ ed .
in the Kre@@ feld area , the city operates 46 day@@ care centers , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch time .
last kit@@ esur@@ fing year 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime not only children , who are cared for 45 week@@ days , eat at the K@@ ita at lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care , if children remain until 2 pm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time employees have kitchen service starting September 1 : they warm up the delivered dishes , add salad , raw vegetables and fruit , divide the meal individually , give food out , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as squ@@ ad units - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen assistant is now a member of the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital administration to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about eating healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - previously also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also the charm that it has shown in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign awards for the city as the most economical one , it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ configured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much in weight for 750 persons in the educational sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are going to run in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ pres@@ idents and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tali@@ ban has published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year the elections for the first time will hand over power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ som , a strong role for women will reinfor@@ ce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women of a total of registered 3.6 million voters are registered .

men try to eradic@@ ate 13 @-@ year @-@ old girls
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday .
according to the police information , the men talked to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends on the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2.@@ 55 a.m. because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone .
but the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and went on with her friends .
as a result , one of the perpet@@ rators tried to attack the mobile phone and the girl &apos;s necklace , which however failed .
the duo managed to escape without prey .
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations are ongoing .
G@@ MB app@@ reh@@ en@@ sion on investments in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie facility in Glasgow
a union would like to make sure that Mc@@ Vi@@ tie is responsible for the long @-@ term commitment to production at its Glasgow facility in the form of managers of bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company has out@@ weigh@@ ed the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which alongside other products produces hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea bis@@ cuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ Soft &apos;s owner Pla@@ dis said he invested over 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter addressed to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s insist@@ ed on &quot; saying concerns that financing for modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Senior Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply affected by our members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the workers focus heavily on the local community and the large @-@ scale Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman for Pla@@ dis said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The manager at T@@ oll@@ cross received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland last night , and the company will respond directly to the fact that we value our ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross project , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility . should our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La League may regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave N@@ ey@@ mar in pursuit of an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record raid ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , taking Paul Pog@@ ba back in the past season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United .
after the termination , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world &apos;s highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ lete . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans board insist@@ ed that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but three years ago , the football world was warned by the PS@@ G president before this prospect ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ i@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ i@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish Society expressed interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prize offerings for N@@ ey@@ mar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is what author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann says .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are a Church , &quot; stated after publication to the German Press Agency , he received an ap@@ ology from former Regen@@ s@@ burger Bischof and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as from Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ zed Pope Bene@@ dict XVI .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church much when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret over their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false evaluation of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in reporting on violence in the cathedral @-@ cats with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in regard to the attacks in Regensburg , nobody doubts that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Hist@@ orian and Member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee , should be con@@ spic@@ uous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis also said in the interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we like to go to the church and this is a dev@@ our@@ ing meal . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ kes were a very normal educational means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for decades to come , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger , writes completely wrong@@ ly , writes poetry ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says E@@ zek@@ iel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the At@@ tor@@ ney General Ulrich Weber by the B@@ ish@@ op@@ ric of Regensburg ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of ass@@ aults . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that in many cases Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister was used in many cases of physical and psychological violence .
especially with high emotional emotion@@ ality , punishment for the students was even more violent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other accused , many victims inv@@ aded the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even combine positive memories with him in spite of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s opinion is reli@@ eved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ ci@@ dents of Viol@@ ence of Viol@@ ence at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , many students stand out for their &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , he appears also as ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ sts and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became more and more tangible when a domain record did not bring top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger generally occurs in it .
he has just been devoted to eight pages and he is clearly exemp@@ ted from any suspicion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ operation in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses at the pre @-@ school also took place outside of its sphere of activity .
one can , at best , pre@@ tend it , to experience it too late or to have taken first hints not seriously enough .
the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um on which he worked was felt by almost all respon@@ dents as - as literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
thus also the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes a very excellent testimony , describes him as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding &quot; as a very good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always surrounded by children &apos;s grapes . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotional appeal , which also led to wound break@@ ups .
the fact that he didn &apos;t only hit the floor with chairs and cast the key ring on the floor , but also gave ear @-@ feathers scattered and over@@ looked boys on the hair or ears , he himself had already given years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to its salvation it must be said , however , that such educational methods were widespread in the time of the 1960s , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as with teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , it is ad@@ mitt@@ edly dre@@ d@@ els .
one wonders whether it is not more familiar with his fame and role as a brother of Bene@@ dict XVI that many media had just pl@@ ung@@ ed him .
many who have never understood him at the Bavarian Pope are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is : the report bears witness to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
much about the subject of mis@@ use in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen has been reported in the media in connection with the report .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger placed in the final report any involvement or co @-@ workers with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault has claimed to have become familiar with the cath@@ ed@@ ral@@ â s master .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one affected person representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing was very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was , however , that most of the victims are silent .
if they didn &apos;t even confi@@ de in parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir director who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators in a professional manner .
how do R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s cath@@ ed@@ r@@ als judge R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role with regard to the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able disciple thus formulated it : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that it is expected that ... Bu@@ ben have opened more penet@@ rable or clearer or even more openly than their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of the investigation , the students and / or their surroundings affected it in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free to speak of any complic@@ ity .
so he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the display .
therefore there is no reason to link up his good name to these re@@ cover@@ able crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cath@@ eter Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Weg@@ eing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this reproach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that in reporting everything is mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is precisely the abuse of the report .
because it is clean@@ ly separated : between the pre @-@ school and the high school of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and violence @-@ eating as well as , we say once , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , i.e. also four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the ch@@ oral director of the cathedral @-@ cats .
all the horrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were mis@@ judged and mal@@ ig@@ ned , and suffered terri@@ bly , all happened at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions had to be ruled .
but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only face when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , as most of the witnesses emphasize , the theme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac &quot; conditions .
what was different on the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
and this is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even combine positive memories with him in spite of violence . &quot;
in this way , at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have looked away .
but in spite of all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( such a witness ) did not want to hear , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently swal@@ low the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the V@@ atz@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even re@@ produces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he pointed out this to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool , the term punishment will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test pun@@ ish@@ ments were also banned in Bavaria .
before that they occurred in a legal grey area , as each of us probably still knows .
it was difficult for him to guess where the affected persons might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where the permissible limit was actually exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that it always looked away .
that just isn &apos;t right .
only in 1980 the test penalty was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis asser@@ ted that it is unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards at that time .
how do you see that ?
Michael H@@ emann : we histori@@ ans are talking about the &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today &apos;s moral standards .
the princess was right .
but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able at all times , and not for what was broken in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , which goes far beyond that then practice .
that &apos;s all really aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be re@@ worked .
but at the same time , I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , i.e. sla@@ p sla@@ v@@ ings and on the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when corpor@@ al punishment was then forbidden , it has kept strictly adher@@ ing to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his Regen@@ s@@ burger time did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger play in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the theme of the test sentence also come to language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , tells from his perspective , as the cathedral @-@ cats only played a minor role .
nevertheless , I did not at all mean that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but this must also be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding un@@ conditioned discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world @-@ rank , true cultural ambass@@ adors of Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , un@@ ru@@ ly boys are no big singers and before every success , no matter what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people have you ever experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks with her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through his work in the book and beyond , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger quite well and again and again experienced a wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , deeply beli@@ ever and heart @-@ loving person , of whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could only be able to do something for a fly .
I regularly get in touch with him , like many former dom@@ es still today , 23 years after his exile , regularly visit him , visit him , read him - he &apos;s almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family .
those who did not forgive him until today that he was once strict with them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most of the cathedral @-@ cats are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them the world of music to them .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able resp@@ ectable person , to whom they still look at and which they almost ven@@ er@@ ate .
and please , once again clearly : all that one acc@@ uses to him are educational methods , which were on the order of the day at that time .
we can be happy that we have long passed this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has a more prominent brother to become a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that is behind it , only too obvious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the report that has just been published reli@@ eves him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the applicant would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
