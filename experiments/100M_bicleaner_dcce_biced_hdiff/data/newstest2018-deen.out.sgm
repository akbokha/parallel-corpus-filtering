<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">A Irren-Anstalt, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A mine chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners cultivate the former ground of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">Munich's oldest official map promotes exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows that, because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals of Bavaria to the State Government, are anything but up-to-date - yet very enlightening.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria atlas is a flickering carpet, which one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large overview map, detailed maps, so-called position sheets, were incorporated into cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These arose according to the Bayerische surveying authority between 1810 and 1864 and originates from the first survey in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops were finally removed from Lunéville on February 9, 1801, today's neighbours, who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map.</seg>
<seg id="18">Elector Max IV Joseph drove the project forward, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus Bayerische surveying.</seg>
<seg id="19">The original position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is, like all others, to be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded into all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was established 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877, as the district of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendling concentrate around 1856 along the present Plinganserstrasse, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: handwriting numbered tiles from the so-called "original recording," from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Today, small parcels do not occupy any farmers anymore - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in the sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, the scene of the October test since 1810, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar, the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the area of today's Au-Haidhausen district it is not only possible to read the street name "at the restaurant" or from the height "On the air" - but also in big letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße you once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59 the Munich-based district-asylum-institute "Auf der Auer Lüften" was established.</seg>
<seg id="34">Starting in 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time, and for instance finished settling the so-called Irish." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he prohibited the personnel to use violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients first place was first, later on 500 places were expanded.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was insufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenaissance in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, is located there.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people meet in the area of the former Auer Institute in Salesianum in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the TSV Munich football field east, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - architecturally referring to the original building of the asylum system that had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "Main Square" "" "in 1856 and the Kaufingerstrasse was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies bombed a lot of holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A large remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages stood at Marienhof, where these days were preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn station.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizen Rights Group publishes Travel Warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The national association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the Federal State Missouri, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for afro-american travelers, visitors and Missouri to pay special attention when travelling by the state, as a number of questionable, racist-based incidents occur recently throughout the state and be noted here," says the Group's statement.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination suits, as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state that disproportionately target minorities, initiated the group to issue the warning, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents like racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more gasoline during the trip and taken custody by the Missouri police without being accused of crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also pointed to a recent report by the Office of the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Saint." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be willing to bring Caution money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri reported in 2015 100 hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the hate crime report of the FBI, which classify the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "the warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States had adopted immigration laws that local law enforcement agencies commit to arrest people due to immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling according to ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Soft fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weidezvn project is a successful project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have given a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU-Ortsverband, together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies, met with the right-wing court of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first granted insight into his farm, in which he managed 55 hectares of lawns and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as well many kittens provided and accommodated in five apartments Feriengaeste.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest" "" "is for him the alternative marketable marketing path for milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">Only regionales arrive at the table of the Feriengaeste.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also the chairman of the" "" "Fisherman Fischbach" "", "he described the soft-fence project as" "" "essential." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profit on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area provisioning for a lot of work, much has to be worked on with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the parental farm and managed it without any chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if it does not lead to biooperation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear:" "" "the Commune recognised the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leader promotion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3,000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestation of the land could be drawn out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how to continue their operations," "" "stressed the Mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced off by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open space is therefore 40 hectares, which cannot be afforested by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was supported by a leader, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers kept 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 km pasture.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do a really good job, without farmers and farmers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">Peter Weiß asserted that "" "" "" "best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The LandschaftschungsGuideline (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state sponsorship of electric fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The precondition is the existence of a flow set drawn by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the surface to be fenced must not be tractor-free (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fisher bacher Tommy project in 2018 the application of eight participants with 24 parcels is currently underway, which will build just under 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open space is 35 hectares and the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump-regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the president's proposals for the drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller did not touch the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitants would have lynched him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took up the importance and in particular the importance attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the memorial, was added to his base.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "when Miller Acosta complained," "" "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem to which you refer, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factually correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about contemporary resonance on the crumbling words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, and your oppressed masses who yearn to breathe freely, and the ellowing apostasy of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "on our screens was better to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show the ties between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone, but rather an early Neoconservatives bringing the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty continues.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch will not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh was rather unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted, eleventful, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">In the truest sense it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they need to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever wish to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch will not light up the path, but the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of the United Kingdom's athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the world championship cadre "will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>

<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butflip - who are competing against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m distance, while Eilidh Doyle was elected captain of the team.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Eilidh is rather modest." ""</seg>

<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships in the 400-m hurdles, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-distance runner Muir leads along this path and last year raised five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1.500 m and the 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1.500 m, is another Scotsman, which one should observe after a great season, which included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots not only belong to the team, but in some cases also be involved in the medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammate voted for me and chose me makes it something special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously I am very proud of all the Scots belonging to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>

<seg id="155">Concerning my speech as Captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you can't tolerate the heat-up of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the papers struck him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He was arguing with the critique, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>

<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans staff have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And that is why the American Civil Liberties Union defendant him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"" "the governor's staff dismissed the suit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a reaction with" "" "Na, and?" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's just Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the nation's 50 governors.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and rigorous adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skilful to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair-loose head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">That is why the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum, which is called official and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessarily and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing but a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just true people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani by Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," "" "she wrote in the commentary box" "" "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="188">"" "what the Governor's staff designated as" "" "concentrated spam attack" "" "would probably call others" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical cloths and to arrest or silenced protesters.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>

<seg id="421">Electric-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to give up with the huge number of preorders for his new Tesla "Model 3."</seg>
<seg id="422">In doing so, he has so far assumed that some of the customers have already withdrew their non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the ever triumptious figures on sales increases and more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced for the first time a different, less dazzling number: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">In recent months, Musk had often recruited more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose extradition has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk is dreaming: of the 518,000 reservations, 63,000 had already been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics always pointed out that it is merely a non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="427">"" "in case of cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds)" "" "reservation payment" "" "completely." ""</seg>
<seg id="428">At present 455,000 of such non-binding reservations are present, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">The Tesla Group, however, does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">By 2018, all models should be taken together - 500,000 by 2020, one million.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1800 reservations are made per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla is able to drive his brand-new production lines that have never been tested in practice without any major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 Years St. Hilarius-Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 am to a serenade.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>

<seg id="470">"" "Walter Martini stresses:" "" "it is a unique village jewel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württemberg document of documents: count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the vogtei," at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the document of the document, besides the former parish church, besides the former parish church, there was also a splendid courtyard, which belonged to the church or the patron saint and not vice versa.</seg>

<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, besides the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still recognisable today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "Berg" is the third, the noble settler-centre of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from around 1600 substantiate these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church, burdened and occupied with a priest still remained the owner of this church and could also bequeath this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">This was accompanied by the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greatest of the two crushed on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but later it had to be released during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648), the windows were infiltrated and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the cemetery was also used as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's night in 1834 a storm broke the steeple and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower still existing today remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>

<seg id="507">It is unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved at all, since at the time in Viersen there was only a wind force concentration camp at the border to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this zone of concentration, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are intended to prevent the "sparing" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">The city of Viersen had a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette, a few days before, but it had not authorized the district government of Düsseldorf because of a formal allibility.</seg>

<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65ha large area.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the establishment of the four wind turbines, electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-seater households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re Group wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen's city councillor gave the green light to purchase three wind turbines at the Linnich wind park near Aachen, as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="892">"" "" "" "we don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are fairly constant," "" "he said," "" "The Local." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="893">The high percentage of cases where the person has been judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">In May the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases suggesting that the examined person is 18 years or older. "</seg>
<seg id="895">When the paper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year.</seg>
<seg id="896">The method of the medical age assessment, in the X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="897">A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute whose work includes the assessment of human biological maturity in order to see whether sooner or later than usually they went through puberty.</seg>
<seg id="898">"" "" "" "I had reason to think about it and I don't think the kind of measurement should be used." ""</seg>

<seg id="901">However, Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "in general, you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low.</seg>

<seg id="904">The works on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are progressing well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday, a concrete part of the bridge was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it's going to be great," "" "said Reinhold Leicht, head of construction at the department of road construction and traffic in the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg." ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, the works began at the same time on all three refurbishment bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The end of the building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be complied with.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is an arch bridge made of concrete, covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the two other bridges, it has come into the years now.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges run over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are built from red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 meters long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning got a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons weighted bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the northern side.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a rim attachment that is also used as operating mode.</seg>
<seg id="919">At the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meter wide bridge can be used on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">The pedestrian walkway will be on top of it.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about this is that it is finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">The laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach requires particular fingertip sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable that many companies are connected to.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, fish and crayfish first had to be fished.</seg>
<seg id="927">Traffic is regulated by a traffic light for the bridges between the building site and the collecting fork in the direction of Schramberg.</seg>
<seg id="928">For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach town entrance, the street in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is fully closed.</seg>
<seg id="929">The cost of the three bridge investments is 700,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="930">The whole is financed by the country.</seg>

<seg id="948">In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the leading candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the vice-president Beatrix von Storch hold their speeches.</seg>
<seg id="949">The police presence remains unchanged, but until now the officials had a quiet evening.</seg>
<seg id="950">The AfD event takes a little more than an hour, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there it is announced shortly after 21: 00.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the balls' financial rules affect Neymars moving to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditures of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the leading organisation that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG must prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount tens of tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can make money loose with security so that Neymar will sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the wealthy family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but have to counteract with legitimate sources of income that enable them to break the break-even point in their business related to football.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini for his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that associations who had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked to ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011 FFP shifted from concentration to the debt of clubs to monitoring their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, which Roman Abramovich used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harsher affair.</seg>
<seg id="1133">In the current three-year period of FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">Although Platini's 2015 Presidency has fallen in favor of the Presidency, the UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to scare off excessive expenses.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly intensify the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the Buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the sales revenue for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the hardest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of €60 million (then 82 million dollars), which later was lowered to 20 million euros - and it has been arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs trying to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring was to exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not allow it to be considered legitimate.</seg>
<seg id="1142">That was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the PSA's sponsorship was raised by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 contested that Neymar World Cup ambassador is going to be and such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulatory authorities could be easy to find out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "the previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive every attempt to circumvent the rules." ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preliminary discussions with PSG about Neymars Transfer, announced on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with sales of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and tricot sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signing.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players to see, and they tried to prevent Neymars immobilise by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the President of the League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar's last ownership of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1169">Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there is at the new tender.</seg>
<seg id="1170">However, only Swiss manufacturers are in question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey aims to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the sda, the largest chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Since 2006, the Swiss chocolate tablets are distributed on board their flights.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Prior to signing a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.</seg>

<seg id="1194">And there's another mad-evil plot that Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-done impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>

<seg id="1196">It is a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons sub lip of "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy is like an old cracker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of accidental delusions that could heat this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I accept as his logical conclusion: "wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the band debut of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"" "" "" "Comrade Detective" "" "on Amazon is reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War by" "" "The Americans," "" "on the film" Atomic Blonde "" "" and even on "" "" GLOW "" "" with its east vs. west wrestling iconography. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as a director exists: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the road of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>

<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so much involved in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan Mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resized in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"" "" "" "before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," "" "says Joanne." ""</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I was looking for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and an mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"" "" "" "I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light." ""</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel factory is quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">A classic copper light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went inside," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is very important that when you push the door, it glides very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day, you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here, they have succeeded in increasing the floor space and at the same time using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and which can help create emotional ties in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "these are important, but they don't play with your heart." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square footage of some standard in something quite amazing.</seg>

<seg id="1356">Two decades later, after its Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute over one of the biggest real estate markets of Victorias worth more than $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how her property and her assets should be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp debate over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family purchased a business in Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">The Westco Jeans initially created jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis' portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - roughly two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul approximately one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court case states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The breakdown of real estate and cash has been a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also struggle for control over the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to incompetently manage some possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affair submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs are in the case, with hundreds of pages with affiridavits, emails and reports of companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both parties.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Ms. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy farmers and delicatessen shops from the late 1950 "s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They took advantage of the security to purchase the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jeans of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he started Westco when he was the High School in my last years when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old). "</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on her property benign to her sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before the courts," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>

<seg id="1379">"" "both Luke and Mark are," "" "Paul tells" "" "about the conditions of their financial separation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin was held back very well, although he was a former AFL member and after a biography from Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV star in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media got in contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the Presidency's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico states that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"" "" "" "as John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, on his first working day with executive staff, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House that he wanted to repair: poor information coming into the hands of the President." ""</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "Kelly said that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship to television stretches back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "when candidate Trump was angry because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing," "" "said the former electoral adviser Sam Nunberg in February facing Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keeping Trumps Twitter custom under control, according to six ex-election campaigners, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know - that Trumps tweets would have even more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees have managed it a few times to keep trouble from him, their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented von Trump's controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting dump material that possibly promotes their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to supply doubtful information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former sludge officials say that pumping like a volcano can react to negative press clippings, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he insists on finding out where these come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously accused the president of a printed copy of an article by Gottw.com, the website of the Internet provocateur, Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff of Katie Walsh to "be the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has voiced erroneous allegations and revoked them in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and started questioning employees about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldsmith added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump is receiving. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently undergoing renovation and is to be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Manager company ltd. on April 13, 2014, approximately 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income by the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the autumn of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered to the District Office as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Council of the congregation.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's Lord Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious people interested in the house at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He was to be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group LuisenHotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergwalern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergwalern and one in Bad Men's alb.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia affair: us special agent sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, Sonderkommittler Robert Mueller was said to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "the committee has recorded work in the past weeks, wrote the" "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "with reference to people familiar with the matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper took the step as a sign that Mueller had widened and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The station CNN reported that there were already the first invitations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us intelligence services have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time in targeting the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of the investigations there are to be several men who acted as advisers to the Republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller took a closer look at more and more drumps of private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">A few weeks ago, the "Washington Post" wrote, a few weeks ago, that the Special Investigator Trump personally moved to the centre and searched for the accusation whether the President could possibly hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main purpose of Grand Jury is to examine this evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide if charges are to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand juries are therefore also called the Ankle Clips.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are switched on when dealing with bigger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel can also be turned on by the Attorney General to invite individuals to the hearing under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to CNN, invitations have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, and was said to be in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr. also Trumps advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his former election campaign boss Paul Manafort were with him.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "" "" "legal experts said on Thursday evening in U.S. television that the implementation show that Mueller should not be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly." ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charging of an accusation.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the implementation of the committee is the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Amid the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the president used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">The topic gives the Democrats an opportunity to "feel good" because they have nothing other than they can talk about. "</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But they usually work secretly, he emphasised.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House advocates any action that accelerates the work of the special agent in a" "" "fair way" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey told three times that not against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">There was no reason to believe that something had changed in this regard, and continued to explain it in the statement.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this rationale, accusations against Trump have been loud, he has hindered the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey spoke in front of a Senate committee in June, Trump asked him to stop the investigation against the former national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the Special Investigator and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation on whether Trump Mueller wanted to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent investigator of the Congress such as in the Watergate affair around the late President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the insistence of President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">"" "" "" "several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move." ""</seg>

<seg id="1526">According to many researchers this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has so far been a part of the Larsen-C Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It grows further and further into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the north of this ice shelf the balance of waxes and abortions was disturbed several years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete scholastic file there.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis are in danger, because the front edge has never pulled back as far as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can be disintegrated if one piece breaks at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level, as they float on the water and squeeze ice as much water as it produces after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project to observe Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth biggest Schelow of Antarctica with nearly 50,000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the junction from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural phenomenon and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists it is disputed whether the Larsen-C Schelfeis will now grow back in the long term and possibly come back in the long term, "said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" our models say that it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though these scientists do not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice caps in the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of the Antarctica stretches to South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In the last 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has been warmed around three degrees and therefore ranks among the areas in which the temperature increases the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at the personnel</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU calls on the employer to step out of the employers' association in order to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, the Kreistag gained 41 new jobs in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1,100 employees and officers work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now again, 17 trainees have left their first working day.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teachers in the circle are obviously very sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">There were approximately 620 applications for the places to be awarded this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the group still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present there are still 50 vacant positions in the Mettmann district.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Doctors and engineers, as well as forces of general administration, are sought among others.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "the administration should" "" "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development" "" "at the request of the parties." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to meet short-term demands on skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented application shortage.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be oriented inwards and externally, to show specific measures for newcomers and include an education offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems which you did not know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a" "" "competition of public employers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">This includes a high number of employees who are absent from the service due to illness or age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">It is high time for action so that not even more places remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He had long since made a big surprise in the circle of chalk when he publicly challenged the shortage of personnel and stunned the other parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow an exit from the municipal employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we don't come to a satisfying solution here at short notice, the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - should strive for a house tariff," "" "said people." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">In doing so, the CDU tries to better pay the employees and officials, when the public service charges the tariff for public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently required exactly, increases or more money is only available when changing to a higher level that is oriented towards career years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up, in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitution protection law.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, councillor Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy aggravates the tone to NGO migrant rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they may not continue to do so unless they adhere to new rules for their operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"" "" "" "if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can work," "" "said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa." ""</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after Italian authorities had confiscated a boat to the German aid organization 'Youth Rettet' because their crew worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to comment on the detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, saving human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," "" "said the organization in an opinion on the social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only assess all accusations that are currently being collected after we have collected all the information and assess the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is assumed that its crew will take inflatable migrants aboard, which will be delivered directly by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart, so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting occurred only 1,3 km off the Libyan coast, according to the file of the prosecutor, whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of being overseen by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa have to have an Italian police officer who supervises their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any" "" "essential changes or obstructions" "" "of their rescue operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel laureate organization is Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">Minniti has said in the meantime that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations has declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "in recent days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="1596">He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives, and with Chad, Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate, to enjoy Trials and sights for four days.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Wine Festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour continued at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">There were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were again and again extended ascents, for which long trials were rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim for Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again, the view point was reached at the lookout point, connected by "flowered" trials and moderate ascents.</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days a lot of altimeters were announced again.</seg>
<seg id="1608">Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks.</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers inhaled healing saline in the open-air inhalatorium.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Also Neustadt was controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters, the group got to know the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporty and cultural.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga geos for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Will the sports stars in future be sitting in front of computer consoles, instead of fighting with wind and weather over the stadium racing?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact is: e-sport has long become a serious industry, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">These have also recognised the first Federal Republic of Germany, which are increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and signed two pros for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>
<seg id="1617">"" "" "" "we hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB," "" "says CEO Jochen Röttgermann." ""</seg>
<seg id="1618">"" "he is certain," "" "that there are many clubs going on this train." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1619">"" "next weekend, FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first" "" "Interactive Club World Cup" "", "where gamers compete against each other." ""</seg>
<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven are qualified.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises a agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds, in particular that young people still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially Asian.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent E-athletes under contract, one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the German airline to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In the E-Sport, computer games such as "League of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the soccer simulation FIFA are challenged at the competition level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, Ligen has long since become established in which the pros compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in Asia, e-sport is already part of the official program.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to it.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobber has also long been dealing with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classic sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, cognitive abilities require a technical and tactical understanding and rapid response.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"" "" "" "the fit player is a good player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1637">But Frobatic also sees problems: "doping becomes more and more a topic."</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls are difficult to carry out on online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist emphasises the highly integrative effect of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1640">The players are on the way internationally, which is like a great global family, there are no intercultural obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the Corporate Consulting Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth for E-Sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million Euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsorship and big tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">Sales totalled 130 million in three years.</seg>
<seg id="1644">This is little against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundesliga.</seg>
<seg id="1645">"" "however, e-sport is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," "" "the Deloitte-consultants write." ""</seg>
<seg id="1646">Many countries are already on the move.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender from Provence at risk of climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">Lavender is due to the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and insect-borne insects, which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, an expert in the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which in spring brought much less rain and much more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"" "there is also a small cikade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather, there are many of them." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist emphasizes the growing threat to Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodours usually meet Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting about the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists wanted to discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a plaque on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and stomach feelings suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's payroll or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no breaks of violence, and while the bodies are piling up throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto resigned in December 2012. 589 are after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter are their editors and their inspirer of Riodosius, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodosius building. two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 in order to deal with the cases of journalists, it only initiated two criminal proceedings under the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders connected with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely tried in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodosia, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and even though the terrain is even more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">"" "" "" "without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of safety has little use," "" "says Ibarra." ""</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we distrust everybody." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15 Valdez was leaving the office of the newspaper Riodosius in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfth Flow."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter stopped in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival factions struggle here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that every day one or more people are shot on the street in Sinaloa or that the graveyard is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace," if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodosius, has broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all, in February the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for its own security after confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues for the founding of Riodours and sold 50 US dollar participations.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug addiction problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved publishing hard-hit studies without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">"" "eight years after the establishment of Riodosia, she received the prestigious" "" "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize" "" "for her reporting in Latin America." ""</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' by the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be scared.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>

<seg id="1856">The Riodours-Team miss Valdez, the fun bird, who could curse like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Is His love for the routine his destruction?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret start and landing strips," "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "the trouble is, the editor of Riodotin Andres Villarreal said" "" "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened to Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodotin met for safety training, no mobile phones suddenly were allowed. days before it became known that spyware, which is sold solely to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodosia in a four-storey building in a mid-size neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen, whom the Governor himself was not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodosius made three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous maker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an Exposé about state expenditures concentrated on the home town of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows, that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), dominated almost the whole century all political planes.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-profile cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"" "Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous events in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" "" "El Chapo" "" "Guzman escaped a military attack." ""</seg>

<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was turned into a storage room for signs and stickers, protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went the next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist for the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Name disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA testing that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In the whole country, journalists have become phonetics by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on walkways and constructions.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, director Bojorquez is in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and killing them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since been asked to be re-divided by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has violated objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, involved government officials and a" "" "indifferent society" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs but also on the order of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>

<seg id="1928">Its incredibly well preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivores is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk as he pitted on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine, near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that was out of place by the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.</seg>

<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 lbs (1,100 kg) of heavy soil.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"" "" "" "it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa the dinosaurs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivorous, although it is covered with armor and resembles a moving tank, probably was threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technology known as a mating, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to blend better into its surroundings and evade its enemies, say experts suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli according to the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered bankruptcy, a widespread defense method in animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than their underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the shadowing is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure through carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals, who use the shadowing - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable to prey, indicating that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which resemble almost imperceptibly - which hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 Portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haaretz, who were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst banned a 35-year prison sentence after publically classified diplomatic messages about WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August means A Becoming resemblance (a matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwoman and pioneering dissident, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, how anyone could look with these genomic data - the many ways they can interpret and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but openly talked about identification as a woman since puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, sitting in the maning obviously unwell sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just about the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of foreigners from forensic artefacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a portrait of a DNA.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned Muse became an unequal Brieffreunden, who in the course of two years exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili kanungo illustrated comics "Suppressed Images," which foresaw a future in which the president would change the judgment of Overseas and would be able to see the exhibition in person.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would be a welcome type of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to flare up the rigid splits that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about all these things after the strange timing, she said "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning asked with her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is endowed with a heart), an end to the "automatic defragmentation, whose foundation was gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), as surprisingly similar, at least in biological matter, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring along is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so it's 30 of these stories." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned Comic-Novelle.</seg>

<seg id="2155">This was also target-oriented, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manning Stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.</seg>

<seg id="2161">The documents say Cornell-Duranleau died, 26, after several stitches.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the corpse was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene, and detectives examine the stitches as murder while the police are actively seeking the two suspects, said officials.</seg>
<seg id="2165">He has been Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>

<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.</seg>

<seg id="2180">"" "" "" "we will conclude the WADA Roadmap in the near future" "" "- Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko" ""</seg>
<seg id="2181">The Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it won't take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"" "" "" "at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2183">"" "the WADA Roadmap has been updated in this respect," "" "said Mutko on Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of WADA's schedule to comply with the Code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the Organisation's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"" "" "" "everything has been announced, everything is implemented." ""</seg>
<seg id="2187">"" "and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," "" "he added." ""</seg>
<seg id="2188">One of the criteria listed in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigations approved by the WADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sports.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "in reference to the matter, Mutko said:" "" "we carry out the investigation, as our anti-doping system has made a mistake." ""</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"" "but there were no state programmes, and we will not admit anything that does not exist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">Mutkos's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with the Russian sales office rsport at the beginning of the day Smirnov announced problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">"" "no one prefers to accept this report unconditionally" "", "added Smirnov." ""</seg>
<seg id="2195">In November 2015, RUSADA was excluded from the WADA by the implementation of doping checks in Russia in November 2015.</seg>
<seg id="2196">However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti-doping (UKAD).</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck with your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"" "" "" "there was never consistency and objectivity," "" "said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2208">She has called people out of the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of human resources start-ups is on growth to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">Through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, to offer special groups and demographics groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to circumvent the C-Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint won.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to snap surveys and surveys from certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most grievances and what managers have low approval results - so that you can re-bore, why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they must stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won't be the next person involved in scandals, since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who have spoken will be punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, following the financial engineering site Let's Talk payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, who helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the Uber Feverthing in Miskolredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Conan has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Over recently, uber has registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline with which employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the court of public opinion has grasped the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company finds its employees badly treated or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and lawsuits, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Rugby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has deployed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and processes and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a timidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company Convercent uses, problems that have previously been hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair interns - can be identified and addressed more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who heads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment litigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employees Commitment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "Social Media came to their right," "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance given by Venture Capital investors who supported both startups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Cent received $10 million in funding in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November by Bessemer's venture partner and brought his total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees are expecting more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only assignments.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are heard and that the work you do is worth it, they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience on LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors can reach returns when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">When the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take measures.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks staff for your feedback, it may have a expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come fast enough, or not at all, it can grow disappointments and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"" "" "" "if you ask for 4.000 ideas, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," "" "said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied on collecting data." ""</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you don't follow the staff, ask yourself," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about this?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care about it, why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported about Glint, saving.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights into its employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better bond of workers in a sector that is known for high sales.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"" "" "" "if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose the people," "" "said Vitrano." ""</seg>

<seg id="2261">Some have pulled off their tricot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">For a good part of the team, these idle minutes represent a lunch break.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970 and 1980's.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy sitting in the Mainl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a predilection for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: in 2014 he wrote 'Dead Man's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>

<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust only received full access until 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to look after the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>

<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse themselves in the English story, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>

<seg id="2374">Over the past few months we have been arguing about the future of the race track shuttle - now it is going to go very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2375">At the end of the year, at the ailing route, on which the tourist railway drives, is to be built.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In order to secure the future of the race shuttle service in the long term, construction work on the track will start again this year according to the Ministry of Transport.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to further order and sanitise the track Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country commits itself to this connection particularly for tourism," explained Klaus momentl, Secretary of State, on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The costs for the repair of the route were estimated at about 2.5 million euros.</seg>

<seg id="2380">The contract, on whose basis the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future, is currently being finalized, declared expiation.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that 2017 may not become even crazier, a new report comes on the technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-Founder of FRR, we must start taking their Ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people are making fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey at the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can also" "" "adapt" "" "his robot to his convictions and choose everything from the sight of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or colour of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "that would make a stepford woman look progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot enables users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah" who conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as much as possible," enthuses True Companion's website.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods, quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can be" "" "in tune" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex-robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female features, the allusions to rape if one goes a step on Frigid (called here: resisting) Farrah, alarm one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his site compared True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy?" "" "it is said on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notices their rising popularity, they nevertheless remain on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what escapes from the boundary zones can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of the time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not weird or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots come up at a time when women's rights are threatened all over the world, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have sexually assaulted women.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most dreadful aspect of the TV series' The Hand-maid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the intricate body and the stout eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it doesn't feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical likeness to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel humanely aware that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots do not represent real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">You can't separate yourself from your companion or just go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the 2017 Redemption: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Drumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense of man</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a trump-wisdom of the trump-era that the political divisions that polarized the U.S. voters have also split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all ostensibly criticizing all of us to burst out our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-looking poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everyone who knows them, including the republican kinship, with whom she had fought for decades on account of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table that is certainly a good thing, but it falls in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the declining effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalization" "" "and" "" "trump" "", "we refer to the creepy possibility that his kittens will not be dumped one day." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, a more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing are "normalized," which suddenly appear in comparison with his standards as the notion of reasonableness.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to dump in fact seem to be a very mild criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump is going, the next candidate of the Republicans must be spiritually healthy to qualify as an unmeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels of the New York park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurry and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely gloomy and the perpensive music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage counts not - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park-carousel is still a strange magic experience, as two two-year-old, 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given it the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, during this week in a department store, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it's the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store stood horribly angry while I was tired of the experience of submitting my credit card to five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius, for the second time, left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrists, according to which he was tortured to the prison authorities in one case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against a first death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing it several times through a door to the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time to the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appell, which they say is too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "the National Criminal Investigation Agency said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year." ""</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>

<seg id="2467">But the hope of making a chicken out of it broke, the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and swore.</seg>
<seg id="2468">After that the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a chicken dance.</seg>
<seg id="2469">The hens danced with the young gockles that bore the cylinders to the bet.</seg>

<seg id="2536">The place is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Since 31 years Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun, as he conveys in the press talk.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports about varied but also challenging tasks that await his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it is surprising that until now no application is required for the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">So - considering the regular periods of notice - should still be enough time for a familiarization.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach works as a Lower Building Law Authority for the Administrative Community, the applicant has to present the corresponding degrees.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the town in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If it were no longer able to fill it, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But closeness to citizens is important to the city and itself, says Wacker, who reports about a good working climate and good atmosphere between authorities and citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2558">In any case, the City Engineer has a high responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">"" "he is the builder," "" "at the end everything runs over my table." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere, but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">According to the town of Haslach, anyone who wants to inherit Roland Wacker should be able to present a completed study as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor with the subject of architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of construction planning and construction planning law.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting about 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestines patrol in order to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food will not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of triggering infections are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium is too far towards inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found to detect a type of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice carrying a specific bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophane encourages tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system also works with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was investigating a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was however separated, had not had this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced and found in six bacterial species, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but were missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria exerted on the immune system, the researcher L. reuteri allowed to grow in a fluid and transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - onto immature immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice food, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells fell by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells such as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan levels can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reuteri. "</seg>

<seg id="2672">Those who want to rehabilitate their home in the years can soon get support from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">On Wednesday, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives informed city development on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a review of what happened so far.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, there have been a lot of refurbishment areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the existing renovations are a "success project" - it is ultimately important to promote interior development, not only to open up new areas of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, I received the information from the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe that there will be a refurbishment area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The amount of funding amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500,000 euros would come from the country, the rest from the community.</seg>

<seg id="2682">"" "one will further investigate, as Schindler, where the" "" "really old" "" "houses are." ""</seg>

<seg id="2692">In November or December the deadline for punctuation should be carried out so that the restructuring can begin next year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Afterwards, Pietzschmann declared that every Commune had to carry out the aforementioned investigations.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The note also adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the hours a second crew for the return flight would be required.</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the misuse cases relieves Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann says.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are a Church," stated after publication to the German Press Agency, he received an apology from former Regensburger Bischof and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as from Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerized Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church much when Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret over their own omissions or their then false evaluation of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican's" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "on the other hand, criticised that in reporting on violence in the cathedral-cats with" "" "double standards" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">In regard to the attacks in Regensburg, nobody doubts that it is "shameful and shameful deeds" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the author Lucetta Scaraffia, Historian and Member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee, should be conspicuous.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis also said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we like to go to the church and this is a devouring meal."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "Strikes were a very normal educational means" "" "to deal with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It is unfair to apply today's standards for decades to come, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who authored the" "" "My Brother of the Pope" "" "with Ratzinger, writes completely wrongly, writes poetry (translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger," "" "says Ezekiel," "" "because all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is written in the 440-page report presented by the Attorney General Ulrich Weber by the Bishopric of Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "" "with high plausibility" "" "victims of assaults." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that in many cases Domkapellmeister was used in many cases of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotional emotionality, punishment for the students was even more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "" "" "nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other accused, many victims invaded the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even combine positive memories with him in spite of violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In an interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger's opinion is relieved.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "Incidents of Violence of Violence at the Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">On the one hand, many students stand out for their "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he appears also as cholerists and perfectionist, who became more and more tangible when a domain record did not bring top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger generally occurs in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been devoted to eight pages and he is clearly exempted from any suspicion of complicity or co-operation in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses at the pre-school also took place outside of its sphere of activity.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can, at best, pretend it, to experience it too late or to have taken first hints not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The gymnasium gymnasium on which he worked was felt by almost all respondents as - as literally - "salvation," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus also the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger describes a very excellent testimony, describes him as "warm-hearted," "sincere," "competent," "competent" and "understanding" as a very good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always surrounded by children's grapes."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotional appeal, which also led to wound breakups.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he didn't only hit the floor with chairs and cast the key ring on the floor, but also gave ear-feathers scattered and overlooked boys on the hair or ears, he himself had already given years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To its salvation it must be said, however, that such educational methods were widespread in the time of the 1960s, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, it is admittedly dredels.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not more familiar with his fame and role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media had just plunged him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who have never understood him at the Bavarian Pope are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report bears witness to Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">Much about the subject of misuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen has been reported in the media in connection with the report.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger placed in the final report any involvement or co-workers with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault has claimed to have become familiar with the cathedralâ s master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "" "said one affected person representative for the others," "" "Everything was very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in educating sexual abuse was, however, that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they didn't even confide in parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir director who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do Ratzinger's cathedrals judge Ratzinger's role with regard to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable disciple thus formulated it: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that it is expected that... Buben have opened more penetrable or clearer or even more openly than their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "in the course of the investigation, the students and / or their surroundings affected it in the run-up could not be confirmed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus free to speak of any complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to link up his good name to these recoverable crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media a lot of" "" "excesses" "" "were to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former catheter Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "Wegeing" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that in reporting everything is mixed and mixed up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Because it is cleanly separated: between the pre-school and the high school of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and violence-eating as well as, we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. also four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choral director of the cathedral-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were misjudged and maligned, and suffered terribly, all happened at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions had to be ruled.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only face when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on the one hand, as most of the witnesses emphasize, the theme" "" "preschool" "" "taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiac" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this is also true for Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even combine positive memories with him in spite of violence."</seg>
<seg id="2959">In this way, at most, the accusation remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But in spite of all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (such a witness) did not want to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently swallow the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Vatzatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "he pointed out this to" "" "that in the preschool, the term punishment will continue to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as test punishments were also banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they occurred in a legal grey area, as each of us probably still knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to guess where the affected persons might be exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit was actually exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that it always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That just isn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis asserted that it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hemann: we historians are talking about the "pitfall of anachronism," i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and not for what was broken in the preschool of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond that then practice.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all really awful and I'm glad that it will finally be reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishing, i.e. slap slavings and on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When corporal punishment was then forbidden, it has kept strictly adhering to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what picture of his Regensburger time did Georg Ratzinger play in the talks with you for the book" "" "My Brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the theme of the test sentence also come to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, as the cathedral-cats only played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not at all mean that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this must also be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditioned discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-rank, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, unruly boys are no big singers and before every success, no matter what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you ever experienced Georg Ratzinger during the talks with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through his work in the book and beyond, I have met Georg Ratzinger quite well and again and again experienced a wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believer and heart-loving person, of whom you can't imagine that he could only be able to do something for a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in touch with him, like many former domes still today, 23 years after his exile, regularly visit him, visit him, read him - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him until today that he was once strict with them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the cathedral-cats are thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them the world of music to them.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respectable person, to whom they still look at and which they almost venerate.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: all that one accuses to him are educational methods, which were on the order of the day at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long passed this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man just because he is prominently and has a more prominent brother to become a medial scapegoat.</seg>
