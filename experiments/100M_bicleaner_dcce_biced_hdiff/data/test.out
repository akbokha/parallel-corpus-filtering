28 year old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping m@@ all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went uphill again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway .
the victim &apos;s brother , Louis Gali@@ cia , announced that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , shared his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco just six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are during this difficult time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia stated that Frank initially lived in host@@ els but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said that he could not imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
joining us with his family was to always cook something to prepare us for dinner , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia .
he never wanted to take part in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that brigh@@ tened every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the S@@ F@@ PD on the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston hasn &apos;t always had to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star has made this clear in an interview un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always put in drawers or glued onto the outside label that has little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are more sn@@ u@@ ff to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about her as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as explained in the current Cos@@ mop@@ olitan .
the act@@ ress loves to spend her time at home , in front of tel@@ ev@@ isions with loose de@@ bris and Mexican food , in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked the question of the children &apos;s wish : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is to be seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film will run from 25th August onwards .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the pyramid of sport
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little change with some colleagues on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their celebrations , they drove home to the food @-@ trou@@ ghs in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and this ended the riding career again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament wins - again near horses .
he had his family run over the plant of the AL@@ RV , he didn &apos;t even bo@@ ther on a horse for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and there@@ with also at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
in the context of a small gala , German sports aid presented the Golden Sports Py@@ ramid .
there is no lack of awards to the li@@ ke@@ able ath@@ lete .
Federal Cross of Mer@@ it , Silver lau@@ rel leaf , champi@@ ons @-@ tour @-@ player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already ro@@ amed him .
long is the 18th prize @-@ winner of the Sport pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lan@@ ger says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because she is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talents for decades .
and so he continued with the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time U.S. Master Win@@ ner was admitted to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Wirtschaft &quot; on Saturday .
the performers Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the fen@@ nel Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um der Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ stadi@@ on , where the Lav@@ azza price was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger was far from the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade deal - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , both US presidential candidates are divided against tax and energy policies , as well as in a fundamental demand .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton become a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
who , on the role of the State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep those in doubt small and warns about how the state of the economy can do harm - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself , on the contrary , would be quite different , claimed Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will drive back on a massive scale and he will be strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , states that the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has to open up dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money .
that is why taxes for the rich would increase , &quot; she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in the need to invest , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost verb@@ ati@@ m .
the democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical shut@@ down of the Republi@@ cans .
thus , there could be party internal discussions on Tr@@ ump .
distinc@@ tions are the differences in energy and climate policy .
Tr@@ ump plans to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris climate agreement wants to termin@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , plans to explicitly expand and demand renew@@ ables with its investment program : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want we to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too distant from each other .
T@@ PP , the d@@ ei@@ ving trade agreement , do not want to sign them .
at the same time , both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs .
they should be paid better then , according to Clinton .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a star@@ vation .
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must arise , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion in the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens , stands for boo@@ sting growth .
his critics argue that the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to demand at least from the rich that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is for women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each has a baby that is only one year old .
one has put her little son in his arm .
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she s@@ miles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Area Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor of social services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are chicken .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ central shel@@ ters for single @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs opened up the institution together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Women &apos;s Aid in Munich .
recently , it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - even not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; send them hope to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; among women there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly for seeing no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , volunte@@ ering , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that tu@@ gs for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
those who believe that the end , as soon as they come to Germany , is ir@@ re , re@@ counts B@@ ahr .
here too single women in refugee camps are often considered inferior and at worst mis@@ used .
this means that around 90 per cent of women who live in the accommodation in the Munich north are traumati@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children surely did not come up voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women were so used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not speak openly about what they experienced , because shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , more accommodation is needed only for them , asks B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answered with no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia there is no such thing in the accommodations of the Govern@@ ments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fle@@ eing women are not accommod@@ ated separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokesperson for the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia there are stories or own houses only for single women and their children in some community shel@@ ters .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the privacy is missing or are men and women accommod@@ ated together , it can - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separate and easily accessible for women , stands in the study .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read from the impulse given to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have spoken about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily open a second house .
assistant General Stri@@ kes : demands for new Labor Ne@@ eds
representatives of the assistance physicians have called on their union to appro@@ ve new work campaigns in their dispute regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire council to appro@@ ve more labour campaigns starting at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC stated that ministers had agreed to deal with the concerns regarding the contract .
in July , assistant doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in favour of the elections .
in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had &quot; persist@@ ently cal@@ m@@ ly &quot; had problems which led to the rejection of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and solic@@ it official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today submitted a formal application for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating working conditions starting at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the fact that assistance physicians struck six times this year , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the director of the B@@ MA Assistant physician Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ ig@@ ned after the election to reject the agreed contractual terms recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during the sessions which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors and medical students , so that the contract should be advantageous and should be accepted .
after the vote , Health Minister Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and proclaim an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin is receiving his Turkish counter@@ part in the gil@@ ded Hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be da@@ zz@@ ling and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if something bad happened .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s be@@ aming , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that the head of state of Russia had forgotten anything .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was rage .
Putin informed Ankara , accused Ankara of having fallen behind Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater , as it was done by an alleged friend .
re @-@ building the ve@@ to will be difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the state @-@ controlled media launched a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
most serious were the accus@@ ations from senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology he wanted to hear from President Erdo@@ gan .
Russia could win a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was dismissed from his office after a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
this week the national TV forecast cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again .
a Ve@@ dem@@ sti report formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West , as it considers its reaction to the attempted power tak@@ eover as a weak response .
to this end , the persistent res@@ ent@@ ment of the worm &apos;s pace of accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West .
in Ankara , the Russian head of state gained a bonus for claiming that after the attempted coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat , he demanded support for the elected state institutions .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit meeting in this splendid palace on the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present an alliance of out@@ si@@ ders : two countries that are driven by the West and feel ill treated and now unite .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it might be significant that after almost three hours of first talks , both pres@@ idents met at the press conference that they hadn &apos;t even stri@@ pped the issue .
the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question of their differences while Putin chose to emphasize this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster - when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state will at least talk to each other again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s Chief Executive Officer , the R@@ BS label shall only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was linked to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced itself since it had to be collap@@ sed and res@@ cu@@ ed almost eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this period , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts have used &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to protect other end consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to clients in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alised head office and the stock exchange listing to Nat@@ alie will change .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are others , smaller brands for retail business , which are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour by customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor &apos;s brand and the brand under which our employees will be engaged , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we are not pursuing global goals , but local objectives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of the brands , because how do we focus internally ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these marks again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori fin@@ alize his 3@@ .000@@ th gain at New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double in New@@ market , which gives him 3,@@ 000@@ th win
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3@@ .000@@ th British gain in New@@ market on Friday .
he placed a milestone in Pre@@ dil@@ ection , trained by John Gos@@ hen , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ mond and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori who previously won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20.000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori pi@@ cks up the che@@ er when he pi@@ cks up on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved over 4,@@ 300 wins in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career opportunities
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone which only few have reached before him .
it has style and is strong , but it is its tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that distinguishes it from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a have been enthusiastic fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already scored 6,000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already had almost 30 years of winners in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous Gl@@ orious Si@@ eben in 1996 , at As@@ cot , but he also survived an airplane crash and received a prohibition of drugs .
three years ago , he had difficulties in the beginning when he returned from his six month lock , but showed an impressive character to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form .
and he hasn &apos;t finished yet - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his least 50@@ .@@ ten year of age .
Russian President Putin fired Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin recently fired his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was a part of Putin &apos;s narrow trust in many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as Special En@@ vo@@ y for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it reads that Putin has ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ miss@@ al Ivan@@ ovi@@ ch &apos;s dis@@ miss@@ al of his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a deputy for Ivan@@ ovi@@ ch since 2012 , has been appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is said ( in Russian ) that he was later the protocol manager and staff leader of the governing board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state for bills and checks to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest confi@@ dant Vladimir Putin and works as he did for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on TV , both men claimed that the chief of staff res@@ ig@@ ned at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
is this the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that at this time .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president at once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great skep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - trust post for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V assumed the item in December 2011 .
prior to that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he most trusted .
it was once believed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia , because a third term Putin viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another exceptional ally , Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister before he became president again three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he proposed producer
Gib@@ son participated last month on a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced their dis@@ miss@@ al in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al .
on the set there were artistic differences and differences of opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character of Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , which follows a team of FB@@ I agents , is published , according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios is expected at a later date .

puzzles of fishes who landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
one inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff requested help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could act for sandals , which were picked up by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , released a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ bury Crossing : bridge now joined by fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ bury cross@@ ings to the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closure of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deck blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 incline ropes .
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Kei@@ th Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building Que@@ ens@@ bury cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witness to an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit .
a total of 79 % of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck is given a concrete shot for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this fantastic project , the closure represents forward @-@ looking high and low construction .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the expansion of the north tower , we had to close the gap in the north or the country side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern bring@@ ers bridge 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
mas@@ sively , as the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs approx . 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3 % .
delicate since the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters .
fortunately , everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck still alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after being thrown off fishing boat from Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat turned around and put the worst in front of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and found hanging at a bu@@ o@@ y without life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have un@@ har@@ med happiness and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
someone has w@@ aking up today about these men .
seriously injured - man pi@@ cks up his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked and severely injured his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
as the police announced yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to pick up his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
instead , the alcoholic off@@ ender cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was hurt by the hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother .
this then al@@ armed its sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the road they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ life partner .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister side by side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who is installing cheap apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean : investors are expected to become much more accoun@@ table in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Brun@@ swi@@ ck will lose nearly 1,@@ 300 budget apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD suggests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; living in action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next council session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but argument is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
so far , a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Christoph Fr@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban areas will have to show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can , however , also arise in the inventory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big point in the town hall is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces , but as much as 20 percent of homes as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing construction program , which will cost millions and still have to be financed , will provide incentives for incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left wants even harder conditions for investors .
no matter what , so viol@@ a , a tigh@@ tening of the situation is on the housing market .
if the concept of action is implemented , this will take care of additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get skilled workers .
but the programme is not entirely clear : the 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how can we offset the loss of some 1,@@ 300 favorable apartments whose funding will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this from happening , the planning policy spokesperson , Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back to the price binding .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke , the problem could be solved .
because in the western city , dead@@ lines run out at the end of the year .
approximately 1800 apartments could be picked up there in the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies .
because the number of social housing in the western city is dras@@ tically increased again , one is removed from the goal of so @-@ called mixing .
there should be no concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged people in only a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has been concentr@@ ating on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not yet be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens has been compl@@ aining of many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and last on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
I naturally refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a carto@@ on series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs were created ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture decreased interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July something .
the market launch in other countries was shifted by the massive demand over@@ loaded by the servers .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ em@@ ons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger joined the cock and j@@ umped for the search from the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the U.S. , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person re@@ stores each day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch that followed 35@@ ,000 users , reported to the Washington Post recently that within two days of market launch , the number of tra@@ cked people , who exercise every day 30 minutes , j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ emon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to get &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coming from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit de@@ af ears because many public messages are boring for health and come from people looking mis@@ erable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ estimated .
those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ emon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that they enjoy .
three pillars of health are thus covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always , there are also sul@@ len game spo@@ ilers , which have to complain about something over and over again .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what &apos;s it supposed to ?
a breakthrough happened .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could follow our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us any reason to play sports as it does .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be dimin@@ ished over time .
thanks to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant on the whole .
and now , finally , Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast acqu@@ itted on Thursday for the multi @-@ battle title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team Cam@@ er@@ adi@@ n A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the Swedish bar during the multi @-@ day campaign of women in gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ o is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman , who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her call to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
this success in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ esh has dominated the last three years , 15 World Championship med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als , which include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue Team said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she was expecting a final exam in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
do not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be regarded as dis@@ appointment .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , on the left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the women &apos;s solo courses at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ o took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as ex@@ clamation mark on the f@@ arewell ceremony of the team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i who retired .
although it insist@@ ed that during their long journey to the top of never having planned the future , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music , which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ ad Arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and trained by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gymn@@ asi@@ um , trained in Bo@@ or@@ man , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost any more competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will continue as long as it wishes .
even though Must@@ afa was able to lead through two turns , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive .
suspended bar and ground floor - in which Bal@@ es holds the world title - l@@ ur@@ king .
she recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the Swedish bar - and had another 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her sof@@ tly as she expected her final b@@ ump - a pure form@@ ality - and tears streaming on Bil@@ es brilli@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision that she once described in her book @-@ book became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze med@@ als in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ afa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her floor exercise , she threw K@@ us@@ sh@@ ausen , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes appeared du@@ bi@@ ous .
as far as Bil@@ ateral is concerned , the rapidly expanding T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning at the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in a series of mur@@ der@@ ers when listening to music in a car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of Phoenix &apos;s most deadly attacks for a decade , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fired fire@@ arm while he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police told me that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder did not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y over all because the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were owned by one of the adult victims .
the police spokesperson at Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting caused the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is linked to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in His@@ panic residential districts within four months and two others were injured .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; told Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month .
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s , and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence they brought to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting which dropped on an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of serial killer .
investig@@ ators found prot@@ ector sleeves and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the f@@ ew@@ est of his age , Ed@@ mund has a micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t manage it .
I don &apos;t create that .
I did not let myself down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , one has left oneself to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to this was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with help .
Ed@@ mund wasn &apos;t able to sit or craw@@ l until his third year of life and he can still not speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund suggested for &quot; Please sing something before . &quot;
&quot; we teach him character language , &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical sign language -- it says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters on his own .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic such as Ed@@ mund and infection with viruses such as meas@@ les or zi@@ co@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to rec@@ alls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I wonder@@ ed what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t been asking for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I do not expect it to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
you know it will get better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives cause to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the Emer@@ gency Corps on Friday . it is expected to have more rainf@@ alls all day .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding to extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that civil servants are in constant contact with local authorities and help the communities affected .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesperson for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa alone requested ten thousand sand bags .
a flood warning system is used over large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana until Saturday .
the weather service allowed that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday as it continued to rain in the mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will all probability reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could floo@@ ded many houses in the subur@@ b opposite Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers flow slowly into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the tro@@ dden rivers .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still tra@@ cked people from the flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the Sou@@ thwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , rises steep@@ ly overnight .
he said that another boot @-@ son who lives near him would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and flow@@ ed in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told H@@ ans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
H@@ ans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he was the only one who can swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that res@@ cu@@ ers had res@@ cu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread out quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities could consider ev@@ ac@@ uation procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer informed about 13.@@ 75 inch of rain near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil has been considerably su@@ cked by rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and street floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and a lesson in five bor@@ ou@@ ghs .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a subordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , both floo@@ ded now .
the Chief of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven animals washed by the floods .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were built to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the commune of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to the flood and sand@@ bags were provided for the residents , hoping to be able to keep the water out of their homes and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ ing of the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the Emer@@ ge Coun@@ t@@ ys Emer@@ gency Manager told Ru@@ pert L@@ acy that it was still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a handful of houses were reported to have been reported to be floo@@ ded on Thursday , but no noti@@ fications were reported on Friday .
Kei@@ th Tow@@ n@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tow@@ n@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bul@@ lied by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police announced that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown has suffered several injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was in hospital when he was transported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was perfor@@ ated by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grand@@ mother Del@@ ore Mel@@ ende@@ z to the station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the transmitter that it is likely to recover .
he would have started the first class at a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 year old , who is in a critical condition , found shot , reported to the sender .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police found out whether one of the injured men could be the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that it apparently had come to a cross@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
prot@@ ector sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ cked back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , were crow@@ ding the crime scene .
it seems that this has been clearly a lasting battle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were tubes .
in this way , there seems to have given several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di the police in Philadelphia to the station .
several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area .
there was no arrest , and the police are re@@ port@@ edly inspec@@ ting the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross trainer when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I imagine under the women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and for more than a reason .
first , since 1984 I took part in every summer Olympics and the USA had never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who were inspiring many young girls in other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is Catho@@ lic@@ in , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic feminine presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one female Tur@@ ner was an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three @-@ time world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were expecting unexpected but master@@ ly gy@@ ro@@ tic routines .
on Thursday , Sim@@ one became the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold in an individual event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but so gymn@@ asi@@ ums in the whole country do not look like .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie took the same path as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to join the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four runners in the team . moreover , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but reality looks so that gymn@@ as@@ tics is an expensive sport and attracts Tur@@ ner primarily in private gymn@@ as@@ tics , which are maintained by parents who pay for training , registration , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . the list can be continued at will .
the majority of these sports clubs lie in prosper@@ ous suburbs , which can support business .
in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started the gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to give the communities inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ reach gym workout .
I founded my gymn@@ as@@ tics for 20 years .
in my events we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young@@ sters ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest for the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of Girl Power through the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team and thank you for getting so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors would like to organize more strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assistant doctors who voted in the election rejected him .
in July , Hun@@ t &apos;s plans had v@@ owed to forci@@ bly introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS would be found in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and that any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients .
the first veter@@ in@@ arians will receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend stays in order to improve maintenance and maintenance .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chair@@ woman of the B@@ MA Committee for Assistant Doc@@ tors informed the last night in a communication : &quot; assistance physicians have still raised serious concerns to the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat the current crisis and admini@@ ster it to treat all physicians . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out .
efforts by the B@@ MA to resolve disputes through talks have been met by the government for the sake of ad@@ versaries , and sometimes sil@@ enced to de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this happened after a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t at the end of the month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , raise awareness and address the cares of the assistance physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he fails to do so , the doctors made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work campaigns .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 times , since nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to provide coverage for clin@@ ici@@ ans .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting the re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA proposes a better week@@ end@@ setting for the 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Manager of the N@@ HS employee , urged the assistant doctors to stop the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; labour @-@ fighting measures do not reach anything but little , but already strain over@@ bur@@ dened teams and service providers and prepare the patient , foster parents and their families only sor@@ rows , distress and interruption . &quot;
in the last two months we talked to the committee of the assistant doctors and responded positively to the health ministry as well as other mini@@ stries to the concerns regarding tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of cur@@ riculum , training vac@@ ations and gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , health education England and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with the agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication that can lower heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ inflammatory drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medicine is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or heart attack .
N@@ ICE &apos;s N@@ ICE Regul@@ atory Authority recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
N@@ ICE &apos;s N@@ ICE Regul@@ atory Authority recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140@@ ,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffer from a heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form coverings .
when the flooring breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ aches the blood flow to the heart and thus causes a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots trigger , it can flow through the flow of blood and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
individuals who have had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the initial draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Healthcare Assessment Centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person &apos;s quality of life .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who have had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information about the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture allows electoral fraud to flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man was removed last year on the dis@@ miss@@ al of a government report due to corruption from office
a culture of political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has shown that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is unknow@@ ingly ignored as a crus@@ hing government report today revealed .
former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town coun@@ cils to ignore evidence of electoral abuse on the basis of &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Local Government , who is now an answer@@ er , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious subjects would be so bad that it should be permitted by the police to set off barrier tapes outside of election boo@@ ths to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should lead an identification card to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment a vot@@ er has to name only his name and address .
the report proposes that ink not be removed on the finger of a person if they give up their elec@@ tive voice in order to prevent someone to vote twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of un@@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not just against electoral fraud , but should also protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ let El@@ ection sc@@ andal in the east of London .
last year , a special electoral commission decided that the inc@@ umbent mayor of Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man was to be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Tribunal found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal manner &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
Rah@@ man said : &quot; his campaign is based on the fact that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose it . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of an im@@ itation in which one person chooses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said there would be evidence of fraud across the country .
he expressed himself especially al@@ arm@@ ingly to the frau@@ dul@@ ent election of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , m@@ apped , made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system , including leading out to prove identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the older , in particular communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi backgrounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; state institutions have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour on the basis of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists edit letter election documents in order to stop &quot; harvesting . &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires harder registration checks to prevent the election directory to be used for the purposes of immigration and social fraud .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has given up her voice to prevent someone to choose twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible for election .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic letter selection .
ban political activists to edit full mail@@ ings and envel@@ opes of letter elections .
the police have the right to set up lock@@ outs for election stations .
a change of law which facilitates a prosecution for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 .
prohibition of photography in election stations .
request that only English can be used in the election stations ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees generally en@@ force the voters going into the bal@@ lot box alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric notices the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there was no criminal complaint after the Tower Ham@@ let case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral district has declared Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons - in accordance with the high requirements of criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registr@@ ations of the city coun@@ cils . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country is a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy for K@@ ate Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous double @-@ go@@ ers of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio will be amazed by the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , which has proved to be an impressive double @-@ viol@@ inist of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic Champion is by no means the only ath@@ lete fighting Gold who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not when one is allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Games with more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and wolf : team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the rac@@ et@@ rack , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be .
the team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks like the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cover@@ tly .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I do not see any great simil@@ arity , except for facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy told the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good looking guy , so I think it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the highlight of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ jum@@ per Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa with her big expressive eyes is said to be a double @-@ singer for the Cu@@ ban American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African Schwi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for many years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one step higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal @-@ s@@ wimm@@ ers Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va has more than just the sun@@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the simil@@ arities
theory put into space : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar facial form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in Tur@@ unen Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers died &quot; like a pig . &quot;
By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis of the fourth place of 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m Frei@@ stil stag@@ fl@@ ed spect@@ ator of the C@@ BC live broadcast of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ic Games on Wednesday
the Canadian channel C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer was &quot; like m@@ apped off &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off when at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free @-@ style swimming pool he gave his own opinions .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought to the C@@ BS commentary team to give more colour , could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , going down like a depression , died like a pig .
thank you for that .
the Chinese float in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second leg of the bu@@ oy@@ ancy chamber 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which made it possible for Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
viewers in Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and speech
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ te twe@@ ets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Does the C@@ BC comment@@ ator have just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not capture that they were still on stream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described at the final 4 x 200m Frei@@ stil Water Squ@@ ad@@ ron for women as follows : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came fast and hard , with which many asked him
Twitter users did not stop when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; &quot; &quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like ra@@ cists . # disgu@@ sted .
a short time later Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC programme , was responsible for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we are sorry that the comment was broadcast over a floating performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , I &apos;m sorry it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of 90 times with the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ kt on Twitter
Scott Russ@@ el &apos;s comment@@ ator colleague had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ aining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
yesterday night we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on broadcast and our followers in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy choice . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the show and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming team in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ is@@ sion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I focused on the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark is ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who ta@@ sted sham@@ elessly under@@ wear in the midst of the business
the buyers did not know where to go , as a woman pulled out their clothes in the middle of a landmark to try their pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation she looked out how she looked at it , pulled her out and put it back into the shelf .
she continued to browse and rehear@@ se four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark store at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman adverti@@ sed the under@@ pants before putting it back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman tried under@@ wear , &quot; she re@@ treated and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants out of the delivery , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and pants and pro@@ bed her .
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she simply stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put them back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything to come back and go out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b someone - or think about the person who could possibly buy the under@@ pants she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as opposed to thinking that someone would take under@@ pants with home that had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I received , the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled her out and didn &apos;t wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place in our store in Folk@@ stone on Tuesday 9 August . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products coming into question were pulled out of the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit more secure for you .
we spoke to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from front or rear , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your pre@@ dat@@ or .
when you are approaching from behind , you should turn around as first so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; go out of the firing line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
then take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free el@@ bow .
then hit him with the knee in the gro@@ in and twist while the attack@@ er is bent against pain , the weapon from his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while directing the weapon to him .
for attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot , grab the weapon and twist them so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot .
shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and beat the attack@@ er to the chest , then twist the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon to him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it pre@@ emin@@ ates Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is most secure to hand over your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
traveler Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller underwent serious examination of his immune system and worms by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel writer Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k fired his train on a Euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a dish@@ washing button on a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before plug@@ ging in any object he used a lumin@@ aire to show himself and us what he is going to get in .
but the experiment , filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought surprising results .
the idea of replacing the sink of a pull toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his trip through Europe Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he tas@@ ked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his bow@@ el by travelling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ings at stations to sin@@ ks of toilets , the task has definitely put his immune system under a test
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was in any case justified .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial line showed a lumin@@ ometric rating of over 4000 units .
in comparison , the L@@ umin@@ ometer number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to refuse , after the lumin@@ osity of more than 4000 units was , while fresh washed hands have one out of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I have sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I will not lick here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to see and at the same time explaining the advantages of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming , which ended with saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking only about the products , we wanted to put them into a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film &apos;s directing , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I have instructed him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian there , d@@ rown them and others , in which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty delicacies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o from 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they occasionally use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ cial family destro@@ ys social dwelling in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a as@@ o@@ ci@@ ale family left their social housing after del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing with a loss of £ 50,000 because it had terrori@@ zed their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were cast after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing association found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls had g@@ aping holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn up , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared on the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that it is now in private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for housing estate at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I believe that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is thought to be regarded as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons living in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dated residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive cri@@ es , disputes and cur@@ es .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be demoli@@ shed , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the estate , where drugs were used in the past , the wooden floor@@ boards were torn open
neighbours testified that they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called regularly to the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ gi@@ erte she and her partner viol@@ ently from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation was acclaimed by ligh@@ tened neighbors who said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years alongside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we put the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
now that they are finally away , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood Enfor@@ cement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , stated that it had given the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years
rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown side of the church building
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for her behavior and family , as a del@@ o@@ oning is always the final step that Corn@@ wall housing considers .
this was a very difficult case , because the behavior was extreme and their actions for their neighbors had to be sc@@ ared .
I appreciate all the work done by my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police , as well as members of the community cour@@ age@@ ously sent to us and gave us the information .
I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbors and that the message conve@@ ys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ oning on the floor .
workers of the house administration will now have to swe@@ ep away the garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as weigh@@ ers , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don was fin@@ ed after having found guilty of the possession of a class B drug in commercial intent .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after they were without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and their partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many of the walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that she will deleg@@ ate ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row of the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall announced that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without reproach , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew close to the sun wor@@ ship@@ pers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers j@@ umped up when they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the nozzle drives without seeing what was coming up through the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; twice really flew very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the airplane falling down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fis@@ her boats off the coast and fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that due to the poor visibility , the jet flew a little lower than usual due to the poor visibility conditions , but the air forces insist@@ ed that safety was at no time at risk .
land fires have devast@@ ated these summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people also came to death on Madeira Island .

Sevilla - FC Barcelona fights for the first stage win in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup against FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash rises three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ winner must ren@@ ounce on N@@ ey@@ mar in the balance of power with the under@@ laid cup@@ fin@@ alists and ruling Europa League Champion , who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
in addition , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen is missing .
the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , which clari@@ fies the demand for Bar@@ ca at least for the time being in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen are competing for the status as number one in Barcelona for two years .
in this respect , Coach Luis En@@ rique gave up a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen is the winner in most other competitions .
before the first mandatory match of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness condition of the crew , which was humili@@ ated in a trial game of Liverpool at 0 : 4 on Saturday .
even at 3 : 2 in the rehear@@ sal room against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really know how to convince .
Sevilla in turn has the 2 : 3 defeat after an extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and aims at the second triumph in the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with so far , Barcelona is the record winner of this race .

the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would take the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sets and in time outs , they didn &apos;t have any coaches .
they had pulled back on the grand@@ stand and left their cont@@ ests alone in a fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matches until now I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang said fol@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists pos@@ ited with the China flag .

Ma had really strug@@ gled with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
after that he set the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang with only a total of 13 points .
due to the superi@@ ority of Ma not the expected thrilling match developed .
but nevertheless enough astonishing ball @-@ changes were to be seen nonetheless .

Donald Tr@@ ump cle@@ ars &quot; huge problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Republi@@ cans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative federal states to lose their majority .
U.S. Pres@@ idential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now announced weaknesses of his campaign in the former Republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aires expressed something like concerns as correspon@@ dents reported .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals inside his own Republi@@ can camp out of the race , doubts pers@@ ist in his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump before evangel@@ ical Christians who asked him for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilty were false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media .
Republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds go w@@ ack@@ le
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Republi@@ cans .
surv@@ ey@@ US survey from June suggests Tr@@ ump and his bank@@ rupt@@ cy from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump at the front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the Federal State .
Arizona and Georgia are also considered to be endangered .
in an interview by the CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question as to how he wanted to stop the rise of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
and whether afterwards : this will either be successful or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he makes no difference to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it was not enough for him at the end of political correctness , then this was fine , said Tr@@ ump further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party is reported to have threatened Tr@@ ump to strike funds to support his electoral campaign , he should not be able to present better poll@@ s .
instead of doing so , the candidates of the Republi@@ cans for Congress would be stronger .
biggest fraud in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C intends to set up a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games .
after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee announced to immediately establish a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary told us that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , delivered a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch .
this was reported to the team leader K@@ eni@@ as of dop@@ ing control engineers .
the IA@@ AF world association has investigated the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , divided an IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures taken by the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the IA@@ AF . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the control station and issued himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch , released and signed the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said K@@ eni@@ as Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete who was on the list for training controls of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch was over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan track leader Michael Ro@@ ti@@ ch had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio games .
he is said to have informed about outstanding dop@@ ing tests against money payments sports@@ men of his country .
according to media reports , he was arrested on his return at the Nairobi airport .
in the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing failures in Kenya , Kenya has been under special observation since a long time .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls put up by the IO@@ C before the Rio games , it was unusual that athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
before the summer games in Brazil , the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency exer@@ ted a great deal of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
as a result , the WA@@ DA took Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
athletes of the country won the most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television reports of the ARD , alleg@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing agents are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of sports fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had hired them in the field of Russian athle@@ tics .
in doing so , it could be proven that in this sport it was cur@@ bed evenly and systematically .
Russia &apos;s athletes were subsequently eliminated from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Salzburg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Shakespeare @-@ Jahr the Salzburg Festival presents the West Side Story with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the West Side Story , &quot; le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins Meister@@ werk .
the artistic director of Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classical music and fulfilled herself with the role of Maria a youth dream .
in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var orchestra pit under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that she is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria in this production .
she re@@ members with melanch@@ oly about her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Maria always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so she is smart , of course na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with it .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the West Side Story : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the off@@ ert@@ ories have gone to New York , and the New York residents didn &apos;t want it .
they are the same themes , and they are as meaningful as it was then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago , her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Group &apos;s bul@@ war@@ k in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died according to her family shortly after she pre@@ tended to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other ma@@ ids from the east of London got into a plane in direction to Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria , and within a few months she became a widow .
Rei@@ d says Clinton won the Supreme Court in the case of an election victory at Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the president &apos;s candidate , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked the recognition of Gar@@ lands since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he would expect Clinton to &quot; select &quot; Gar@@ land with a certain amount of certainty .
a spokesperson of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton about whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ul@@ ators .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the top judge for the U.S. App@@ ell@@ ation Tribunal for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Republi@@ cans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ per heroes of Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also noted Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
Tre@@ ats wants Nack@@ t@@ kal@@ endar for &quot; Women and for Men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazin works with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to bring a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked human beings , they would like to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
at the beginning of this year , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us that his nude magazine distinguishes itself from classic school play@@ boys , as Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do that for women .

Turkey : Kurdish Community reck@@ ons with mass exo@@ dus
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who don &apos;t adapt and ano@@ ise Erdo@@ gan sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ based Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the short term , the Kur@@ ds community of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of protective seek@@ ers who flee from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , there might even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the hard work of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ ds community Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with several hundred thousand protective seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government has already covered Kurdish bur@@ gh@@ ers with criminal sanctions on the eve of months , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing within Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the hat@@ ched put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks came to the fore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to start new in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state owned by refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief of the band lam@@ ented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tical cities .
in this way , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been wi@@ ped out or driven out over the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of the Association called for the Federal Government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , too , a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan @-@ revi@@ e@@ wers is taking place .
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , above all Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the Brand@@ marking as Gü@@ len @-@ Pend@@ ant destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t adapt and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the K@@ em@@ alists and Sa@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports by calling on figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks already made the largest group of the Se@@ ek@@ ers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
on the balance sheet date June 30 , this was 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and therefore almost 29 per cent of all recognised as Se@@ aled @-@ Se@@ ers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , they do not find those before war , poverty or lack of perspective .
the right to asylum according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to vote on the parliament day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they understood .
until 2021 , the Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
more stupid than it has ever been : summer holidays , heat and land competition - that bit@@ es .
the locals , who are to be persu@@ aded by the elec@@ tors , are on holiday .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on Use@@ dom , Ru@@ egen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so should not choose the land day .
in addition , there are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers , posters hang up , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count towards the end , only lab@@ orious .
until September 4th , 2016 , the poll@@ ing and final day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again pass an election campaign among the people over themselves .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of the SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s .
it is exciting how strongly new@@ bie ap@@ ops trunc@@ ate and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ able .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his big posters .
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes roses and talks a little with the people , just as his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel has the blame for the Af@@ D &apos;s blo@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ st@@ ened the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the most beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make an election campaign at the right time at the right time .
she has invited chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to big events twice ; Merkel &apos;s federal election circuit is in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compl@@ ained Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
otherwise the Nor@@ theast @-@ CD@@ U largely ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual campaign status at market places and shopping centers with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , says Kok@@ ert , only plays a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union also noted that in the country you are crum@@ bling the base that it needs to be very strict , to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you see it as the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any left in the vast expan@@ ses of the country .
the Council of the CD@@ U @-@ campaig@@ ner Kok@@ ert is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much is at stake , S@@ ella has now called its SPD to a particularly committed election campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 per cent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just just in front of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the 2011 election , the SPD clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens , the small party with seven percent in poll@@ s , should make the leap into the land day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the emergency holidays and publish their campaign largely on the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the national president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green elec@@ tors go on search for local vocal boo@@ sters among the holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just cur@@ v@@ ts with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg Lake L@@ akes and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 rehabilitation : restaurants are suffering from block@@ age
at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end only at 8 p.m. , there are all praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done everything pretty jag@@ ged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff of the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no delay .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south as scheduled at the start of the week until the end of October .
the remuneration of the persons responsible for the construction work will also be commen@@ ded , for example when it comes to the establishment of expe@@ ditions .
since the construction site immig@@ rated to the south on Monday and the locking of the asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and therefore the connection to Rot@@ tenburg has again , the traffic situation within the village has eased .
the citizens can now drive from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 back on both sides .
the cre@@ denti@@ al transport through the village seems to go back .
&quot; there were some considerable complaints , &quot; says the deputy chief officer Florian King responsible for the management of the rehabilitation project .
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ strasse , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping paths were looking for and more familiar with their navigation than the sign@@ posting .
what led to the fact that some trucks were fr@@ ing@@ ed in residential areas .
since the speed limits were also not met , the municipality called on M@@ ös@@ singen &apos;s measuring vehicle .
&quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation himself .
two to three per minute have already been carved .
the quick@@ est was on the way at 77 km / h in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has been moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a little con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg now the street is open again .
business@@ men don &apos;t like to look into the maps .
but the fact that the B 27 refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to sales collap@@ ses at them allows everyone to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. for other companies , have little consequences for the refur@@ bish@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the deal@@ er@@ ship Ma@@ ier Thomas Sul@@ z talks about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most easy drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cat@@ ch@@ word is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the places along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crow@@ ned , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential threat .
not only did it , but all the restaurants were hit hard . &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we need to be happy about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he figures sales revenues to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road refur@@ bish@@ ment took its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to dis@@ miss half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , District President Jörg Schmidt on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner said if there could be a financial compensation , with the hint answered , the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now , it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where such gener@@ osity has been handled .
in all law@@ suits , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history .
it can be understood that other regul@@ ars look less frequently due to complicated traffic guidance .
if you can &apos;t approach it , it is also somewhere else beautiful .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts that his regular client@@ ele will return to the end of the renovation work .
despite the crises with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction on its client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is constantly being bol@@ ted on laws in the name of the fight against terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a big security package .
but what has to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the reconc@@ iler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Minister of the Interior in the introduction of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t persu@@ ade anyone .
other , more advanced points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also participated in this .
but as Minister of the Interior , he was concerned with results and in a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition .
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has made a little time to pass before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some things have already been announced , announced , announced : that a new security agency should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany must implement several EU regulations on passenger data and weapons rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising .
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second attempt on proposals not to be made with the SPD : he wants sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and sends jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad@@ mits the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he nevertheless thinks this to be reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything that doesn &apos;t have any chance with the coalition partner anyway .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also presents a few new ideas .
in part , they have in themselves : he plans fast processes for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ aining people from deport@@ ation .
refugees who are targeted at the country should check their smartphones beforehand and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of D@@ ul@@ ances for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse than until now - such as those who commit crimes or throw away their papers in order to mask their identity .
some of it is political and judi@@ ci@@ ally delicate .
some are also still un@@ filled and leave questions open .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient , for example - the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to say that the attacks by Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , many people were worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees .
and things that deeply devoted people could not be wa@@ sted even in election campaigns .
the focus is on inner security .
first the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are electoral campaigns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Union and SPD are therefore increasingly in a position on internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past few days , between the two parties it went up .
only a gar@@ ter dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy ideas collection of some of the Interior Minister , in which the department leaders also demand a bur@@ ka prohibition and a rejection of dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he doesn &apos;t hold anything from a departure from the double pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we satisfied the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it doesn &apos;t make sense to re @-@ en@@ umer@@ ate them .
and in case of a bur@@ ka prohibition , he had constitutional concerns .
whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , must still show itself .
there is a lot of things to fight for .
but the SPD is currently attempting to benefit from internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel clearly signals a willingness to talk and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further enhance security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
still Volkswagen is gli@@ ding through .
despite diesel trains , delivery numbers are rising worldwide .
but not all markets are running smoothly .
in the recall action there is vor@@ tex about a term .
Volkswagen is continuing to start deliveries in the second half of the year .
Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to boast a plus in the course of the year despite the diesel generation , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
however , in July , the Volkswagen brand sw@@ elled mainly in Western Europe and thus again imp@@ acted the total sales , as announced by the company listed in the D@@ ax .
in July , the VW brand sold 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars with 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month .
sales alone in Western Europe , China &apos;s second most important market , posted sales of 14 percent below the prior @-@ year period .
deliveries declined by almost one sixth in the domestic market of Germany .
chief executive vice @-@ president Ju@@ er@@ gen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July , above all , to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have given a purchase back @-@ up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um also stressed the need to leave the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the exhaust generation escal@@ ated first , a minus is also available .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the primarily affected home brand of Lower Saxony is further gli@@ ding through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an ex@@ tradition of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
group sales leader Fred Kap@@ pler continued to present a sales platform from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated exhaust tests with a software .
in Germany alone , VW is calling some 2.5 million cars to be converted into the workshops .
in the course of the retro@@ fitting , VW affir@@ med that the conversion of the cars had no negative effects .
after the conversion of the vehicles , there is no wor@@ sen@@ ing in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after ref@@ itting , the car hire a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Guarant@@ eed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as was said on Friday in company circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is the reason for legal partic@@ ul@@ arities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now giving German customers a guarantee for upgraded diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully satisfied the requirements of my inquiry commission and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from it will not be accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance did not cause any deterioration after retro@@ fitting , and that all vehicle @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not how it was named in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , customers can come to a workshop half a year after the conversion , and this could lead back to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
even in the interests of the customer it is important to avoid that there is no uncertainty about possible warranty rules in case of any other damages which have nothing to do with the exhaust @-@ sc@@ andal .
that &apos;s why Volkswagen does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich savers in future p@@ uni@@ tive interest - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bank Director Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers would have to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not fear to pay for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks are storing money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent pen@@ al code .
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank G@@ mund in September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros in sight deposit or day money accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first € 100,000 are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time , he has been jumping about 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to another and which he could not exploit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are at me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of the costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot put up 4000 euros for each million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter pays the costs now .
leaving cash simply in the banks of the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I have experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! , &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other types of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative society Bayern informed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course costs considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry it alone , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically viable not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards , or bank transfers .
the Thur@@ in@@ gian Folk and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , chief executive of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , and the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said that at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele that is luxuri@@ ously equipped with wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she kept free money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cooperative bank G@@ mund , founded in 1911 , has branch offices in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region live well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; currently no further banks are known to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ operative association of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who calculate a replacement for deposits by private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the German National Bank and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative towards private customers is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany won &apos;t like that in their width .
destination plates : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely men middle age love records .
before comm@@ enting on the comment section , to see him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym of non @-@ Alle@@ en@@ ema @-@ medi@@ ator @-@ medi@@ ator age with harsh insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the rec@@ u@@ per@@ ation of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but rather to Mid@@ life @-@ Nost@@ al@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
there is also no horror through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older members of the record store their emotions more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog were a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run amidst a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest grey suit and gra@@ b@@ bing wild@@ ly before I stopped , holding my hands and saying something better than : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o slowly gets lost in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sal@@ es@@ men were resident - there is still a handful of fantastic plat@@ ter specialty shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera off for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , to whom I am from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of people : eight middle @-@ aged men , one woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
the reason he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buy again items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things with which I was probably a little too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , working at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers whom he meets will apply to You@@ Go@@ v &apos;s profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and set off buying back their old records .
from the conversations I have led , people usually get rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of the record revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional significance of records ?
it takes just a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers accepted the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record covers , of objects that evo@@ ke happy adjustments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of empt@@ iness or possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so for many people .
it is a simple way to get involved spiritually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a team of staff le@@ aks from a stack of records . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an IC@@ M survey in April revealed that nearly 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player .
at that time of the news report , I would probably look very worried as I craw@@ l through a stack of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works in Sounds of the Universe ( number of people : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone just came here recently and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound record so I can put them on the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musi@@ cally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who come in slowly .
F@@ opp , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the vinyl records , has a b@@ lower audience than I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle aged women .
even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts neu@@ ters syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ s@@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ys from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but the mental trauma is hard to find if you are standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for several minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale .
it rather makes a window @-@ shopping as a wholesale purchase .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , therefore collecting sheets is not a real option , it says .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of s@@ labs ... &quot; it drives off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record enthusiasts : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I appear to muster the je@@ ans pants , I watched a group of young girls who group for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of panels of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody can see them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items meant more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even if my research showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they dis@@ regard , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors that exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not bo@@ b@@ bling through the plate shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets through sheets , while avoiding the star@@ ing look of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false pres@@ enter who raises nothing of middle @-@ aged men over the shoulders .

French Court re@@ jects quotation on demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle of refugee camps
a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to submit 72 provisional deals in which people within the camp sell goods , cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell , offer hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be demoli@@ shed because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which sal@@ v@@ age a risk of fire and san@@ ity .
humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also carried out that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 provisional shops , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely comprehensible . &quot;
judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that food business , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than simply feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas provide peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the collapse was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is commonly operated and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 170@@ ,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian it was said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a disaster of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer .
despite the dis@@ appointment of Olympia : Martin remains comb@@ ative
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing appearance at the Olympic time , Rad@@ seas@@ i Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get lost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep looking at the world cup at a glance , stay confident and fight further , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not give an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , I find it hard to comment on the time driving yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to analyse in peace , what reasons could have led to de@@ bac@@ le .
at the World Championship in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will see everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also counts my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ time world champion , who had lost on Wednesday the 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes on Olympic Champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the Enfor@@ cement trailer
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to focus on the next generation speed meas@@ urer : in various federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash units are being tested , which are supposed to perform a particularly effective temperature position .
the futur@@ istic real Enfor@@ cement tra@@ ilers of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used at accident centres where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itate bridges with temporary pace , there is often no infrastructure required to provide a stationary gl@@ itter for maintaining speed limits .
however , a permanent mobile setup can be too dangerous or complex .
the Enfor@@ cement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : the battery lasts five days with continuous measurement operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded across multiple tracks at the same time .
variable speed limits and access restrictions by time , road and vehicle class can also be monitored .
according to the manufacturer , it is possible to move the trailer in high @-@ speed condition with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not easily cl@@ utter@@ ed , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and inci@@ dentally also sweat @-@ resistant outer sleeve disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is intended to protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested in various federal states according to Vit@@ ronic and now also used .
foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
United Kingdom Br@@ ings Silver in 7 @-@ Series Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ 7 Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is when they were struck here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odor@@ us Stadium .
Fi@@ ji issued a master class in handling , side @-@ stepping , re @-@ press , line run and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was swe@@ pt through the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the obvious defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall to them in the fin@@ als .
but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have put a 15 @-@ man team in top form in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Brit@@ on will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben Ry@@ an , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago , she lost every game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sevilla under Ry@@ an .
here they lost only one .
this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began to wonder and allowed G@@ Bs to boun@@ ce off .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. as if you were running in driving bus@@ ses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 up when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au crossed in the corner .
with just four minutes playing time Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i made another attack from the right hand corner he walked around .
12 @-@ 0 and GB has hardly touched the ball .
a vor@@ acious tor@@ ch@@ ell of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute Ath@@ j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua had a touch down in the right corner and there was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa has added a new one since the restart and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u was driving through further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and rus@@ hed to the line to make a goal .
the conversion took a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play 7 while G@@ GB is still learning .
that &apos;s the way it is .
GB introduced basic changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through after a brilliant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt at GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favor of the South Sea sul@@ tan@@ ans , whose fans sang , flags wave and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame resum@@ ed the finishing touch with another attempt in the last few seconds .
the fi@@ j@@ is rang out , the fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and the GB swal@@ lowed crus@@ hing into the lawn .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated 20 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als and the UK pressed South Africa in a short semi @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a score among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the British 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured winning - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by battle with the trainer &apos;s cancer to victory
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ less gold than in these games , and that &apos;s what they mean .
from the first stro@@ kes to the last , 220 hard h@@ ind , which go down in history Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional importance in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams was present when she came to the second Olympic champion in the second without a tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sports , who laid such a benchmark .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9.@@ th impro@@ per deployment , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ letes who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the style of the trium@@ ph@@ al march .
behind every gold in the rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on hel@@ pers who contribute to the incre@@ mental progress that make the difference , and no one was more helpful than the coach who did not know 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer this day .
as he said , he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that &apos;s what they did .
if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of the season , which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to get better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing on itself is already a challenge , but it makes it even bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve @-@ riding morning something more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , which was a cent@@ uri@@ on at the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that might be something extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin , we wouldn &apos;t be anybody , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked myself a better person to train or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning did not lose any races in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to stop , p@@ anning and glob@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very trapped at the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to do something ra@@ bies .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race we did .
the couple will take their time for a year before making decisions about their future .
next week Glo@@ ver has to appear on a wedding , her own with the TV adventure Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to conc@@ eive that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
it feels so much better , &quot; she said .
exemplary clarity provided for 31 years
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert Gö@@ ller , is reti@@ ring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria far exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small , Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for large water producers .
so it was a time ago in the original sound in a contribution of the Bavarian Radio .
little later , the water forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia dig@@ ni@@ fied the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ r@@ stein group was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller , who was 31 years old in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband , stands for 28 years as Managing Director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ r@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , annually supports approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 locations and ham@@ lets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
members of the community are the municipalities of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
water delivery contracts are available for further towns and municipalities .
the current president , Broad@@ brun@@ ner &apos;s Mayor of Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller was employed as a water atten@@ dant in 1985 and was appointed managing director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions , up to emergency interventions on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding event she named the inauguration and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , purchase of land in the area of the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the re@@ development of the elevated tank ( 1999 ) , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the renewal of water pipes .
there have been no down@@ time , and there have always been innovations again , because water means living and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation she lau@@ ded Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has established himself with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association , as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ r@@ stein Group on nit@@ rate reduction prior to the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller , on his part , praised water go@@ al@@ keeper Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water car@@ ver and he was a faithful scar@@ ce .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view he described the construction of well and the restructuring of the association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult task , however , were the quar@@ ry at the high @-@ level container at Kirch@@ lou@@ der on January 3 .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
even the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained because the elevated tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt was filled with tubes .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succe@@ eds Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller .

on Friday , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district of Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday and killed them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself called upon us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;

now nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road by car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burned and has a smooth .

however , it is a few years old .
meanwhile , the man is wearing a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon , such as the police .
he who sees Sven S. shall call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship of relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator in 1981 .
at first , the responsible police in Lü@@ beck wanted to make no information about the Ta@@ ther@@ ing or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; but it affir@@ med that a person had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a crime crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more we don &apos;t say at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special mission squ@@ ad ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick für die Deutsche Stah@@ mer
the crisis @-@ wra@@ cked and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions .
financial burdens , which are threatened by the branch of green electricity , are from the table .
it remains in the liberation from the renew@@ ables environment in the existing systems for so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach that after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z that there is now a fundamental agreement with the European Commission following discussions with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent applies .
but even this will not be collected in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the agreement between Germany and the European Commission for the electricity generation .
so the status quo of the previous regulation is largely fixed .
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have a special significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign , this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of emission standards , climate and employment targets are to be weigh@@ ed off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation exac@@ erb@@ ated further , when the world &apos;s largest producer of agricultural machinery threw massive steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers disc@@ ard Chinese steel companies price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has eased somewhat .
on the one hand , import duties imposed on import steel show effect , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have brigh@@ tened up .
it is unclear how sustainable the price collection is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp cau@@ ti@@ ously remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , prices would have stagn@@ ated .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to close the closure of individual works .
in the German steel industry , around 8@@ ,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Association pointed out on Friday .
after a brief up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the quantity produced went back to each other for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in output .
community , spirit , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp was accompanied by the singing of Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp : as a young girl she was in the school choir , while she taught music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sing moves me - emotional and bodily &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she describes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall more lively , she says .
by the way , she is doing something good in her health and mind .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league .
most senior citizens sing in the chor@@ us and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because social and family structures often dissolve in old age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for the elderly , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled respir@@ ation .
those who regularly demand their lungs , do not get out of the pu@@ ff as quickly in their daily life .
even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
for elderly people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursul@@ a L@@ enz from the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der senior citizens .
in the older generations , the common singing had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people w@@ akes up many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , self @-@ dementia suffer@@ ers are sin@@ king to long @-@ lying events .
while singing , a particular performance is required to the head , L@@ enz explains .
concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially elderly people who live alone do not only focus on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I do something for a long time , I will get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing there is enough .
those who want to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - for 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound comes next to it ?
in search of the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of friends in a senior ench@@ ant@@ or , you can simply join .
many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader .
many senior choirs can also be found via the Internet .
those who do not have access to the internet can ask family , friends or neighbors for help with internet research .
if you want to sing , you should definitely join a choir , tell H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing is good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for every age .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than males to cri@@ es of young animals
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover which effect the fen of cat babies has on adult animals .
to their surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also did not leave the males cold - however , they always kept the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of cat babies in the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond to Lau@@ te von K@@ ätz@@ chen by ten percent faster , who are in great need , as scientists from the Veter@@ inary High School and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) have found out .
males also react to the calls of kit@@ ten - but always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evi@@ dently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of significance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cri@@ es differ with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
a total of nine adult males and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a call of little ones , who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with cri@@ es of more strongly excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers maintain their results despite the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those who haven &apos;t had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the speaker when the sound of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens was played .
this ability may possibly be inn@@ ate or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby no@@ ises several times in humans .
some studies showed that women were more sensitive to infants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football game takes place in Turkey .
in front of the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Be@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even when the state of emergency was suspended in July after the attempted coup attempt in July , the government , the daily life of normal citizens , was not to be com@@ promised .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt .
there is no stop even in front of football .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Str@@ ong Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver .
according to this , the South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
South America is to be followers of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency ad@@ mon@@ ished for 90 days is still valid until October , the fact that most Turks do not have any effects on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country have declared Erdo@@ gan to end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like all the country - split into tra@@ ilers and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the working club Bes@@ ic@@ tas are traditionally not among the president &apos;s friends .
what unites the Gro@@ s of the Turks but in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coup .
even the fans themselves agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Be@@ y@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it will be especially popular again on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved its athle@@ tic value : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as a top scor@@ er of his club .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion .
after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also retired early in the Europa League .
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g there was only sixth place .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed this and this is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Be@@ ik@@ tas the playing year was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 season hits as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cher @-@ King .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez , which was under contract under contract with AC Florence , had announced that it was only bor@@ rowed Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just needs to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club leader Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Or@@ man stated clearly that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot pay for Florence &apos;s salary in Florence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 year old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted Ath@@ le@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who after a dop@@ ing barrier had su@@ ed her start right before the games , was whi@@ st@@ led out mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters chest ) .
it was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scene : she was still standing in the hall with a smile and had provoked her appearance .
when it was established that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience rus@@ hed out into a hur@@ ri@@ cane .
but there are many other sports@@ men who go to the start of the Rio Olympics despite the dop@@ ing past .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic Champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit down for a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after taking the dose of pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
she had strong tooth@@ ache after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion was tested positive for the banned stimul@@ ant agent Meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ ko@@ vic fought the sent@@ in@@ es@@ tion and was locked for six months .
the four most popular lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion more than 400 m , had been tested positive in 2010 and had been blocked for 21 months .
a remedy for penis enlargement was responsible , mut@@ ated Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 metres .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer Th@@ row , Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ land ) : hardly an ath@@ lete had been able to detect so many med@@ als later .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to issue Olympic Silver 2004 for ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the European title 2006 due to testosterone abuse .
the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was also received by the International Sports Court of Justice CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked second of the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record holder and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was only tested positive in May but may still start in Rio .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion found evidence of taking a banned dietary supplement , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA flow@@ ed mil@@ dly and ran off on 13 July .
bomb error in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stands in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered from wounds and had been treated in hospital but I have already been able to leave this .
she planned her home@@ ward journey for the beginning of September .
whether of the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon also Austrian citizens are concerned , is still unclear .
in this respect , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
on Thursday evening , Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital , explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , among them the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two bla@@ sting sets were set up again , another person was killed according to the authorities .
a bomb explosion was also reported by Ph@@ u@@ ket in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured during the det@@ onation near the seaside resort of Pat@@ ong , which was popular among holi@@ day@@ makers .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded , killing a municipal employee .
according to the authorities , the explosive rate had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coastal police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g at the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast called for several wounded .
it was assumed that there was a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bombs bear the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express themselves to possible motives , but probably the acts of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist revol@@ t movement or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage that is limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary , it is assumed that the bombs were put down by opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta .
the authorities have received secret warnings on upcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days - but they were not informed of the exact date and places .
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police ordered their officials across the country to increase security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in there is a palace used for years by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the present bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions given by Thai security agencies .
high security risk ( Level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings .
after disputes between security forces and Muslim population , not necessary trips to these provinces are dis@@ cour@@ aged .
increased safety risk ( Level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were made a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the years to come .
Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to cause chaos while the country is moving towards stability , improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , has managed to restore the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military did not manage to get a grip on the revol@@ t of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country .
over 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack on the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several offices , the Constitutional Gu@@ ards in the Con@@ federation also kept the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clu@@ es for aspir@@ ations to the liberal democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the German press agency Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are treated in extrem@@ ist fashion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s why we now watch the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is directed against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot;
the &quot; Identi@@ t@@ arian &quot; has already been observed in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said that his authority was closely coordinated with the local authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are trying to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the constitutional chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extre@@ mi@@ sts in general attempt to address them with a more you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a solic@@ ited advertising for one &apos;s own cause .
the propaganda is meant to appeal to people emo@@ tionally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
recently , there have been reports from several federal states about contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ t@@ aries &quot; to Af@@ D politicians .
Ma@@ ate said he didn &apos;t have any knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind could only be relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the particular party - in this case the Af@@ D - changes its direction and becomes extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognis@@ able .
with regard to the clear increase in legal smo@@ other crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this regard .
but we have found in recent years that there can be legal @-@ frozen structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
it may well be that other right @-@ wing terrorist groups or groups of small groups are planning attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of legal terrorism is not recognizable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the previous groups were formed on the regional level or in social networks .
worried , Ma@@ ate expressed that many ass@@ aults on the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right scene .
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum seek@@ ers had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated off@@ ences or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who were perhaps politically in@@ different or have voted for example , CD@@ U , SPD or lef@@ ti@@ sts , which , however , have become radic@@ alised by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te Bec@@ omes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or World Records don &apos;t always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bold show of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia went so slowly that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures anymore .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended up with a set@@ back of 48 seconds and won the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporty character that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more well @-@ known .
since most sports@@ men are running in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different .

mail enters the trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms in the vehicle is obviously large .
the post is planning to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
shortly the company plans to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the mail wants to offer her electric transpor@@ ters on the free car market from the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to go on sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for months , the company has been examining whether they are to be delivered to other farms , whether they are delivered to their own developed route sco@@ oter .
post bure@@ au Jürgen Ger@@ des said that there are always inquiries , for example by craftsmen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to news from the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Bonn Group will soon want to enter the mass production of the vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in its post @-@ production plant , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer .
Ger@@ des announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and long @-@ term le@@ vers a complete shift to environmentally friendly vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;

GF@@ RP tour ki@@ cks off after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the Gf@@ K consumer research company exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the res@@ ign@@ ations suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K has gu@@ essed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him remain .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg Market Research Group Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of corporate governance , the world &apos;s number five is facing a new beginning .
the CEO of the GF@@ RP will leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahler is already dischar@@ ged from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
the management in the Management Board will take over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger on 1 September , shared the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is said to take over the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CEO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business policy orientation as a reason for the return . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to call a spokesperson on Friday .
anyone who will be leading the market research company in the future is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in investor circles it was said on Friday that in the shareholders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appointment about the continued success of the restructuring introduced years ago was great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at Gf@@ K @-@ tip since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the recently bad Gf@@ K business figures , every shareholder is at some point rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that were the case with BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ otes like that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the Company did not have the ability to stop its loss drive in the second quarter of 2016 .
at 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable prior @-@ year quarter .
sales of 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million euros declined by 3.4 percent in relation to the first half of the year .
the profit in the second quarter imp@@ acted , above all , the decreased value of the company in the face of its difficult economic situation .
the company &apos;s impair@@ ment of EUR 139 million , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience Business Unit , posted a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K still managed to generate a net income of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus slides in dit@@ ches in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n : eight injured
in the event of an accident of a touring coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered serious injuries , divided the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to give her information to the opposite truck , which was partly on the opposite track .
the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman told the police of Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and ambul@@ ance ambul@@ ance arrived at the provincial road 2 .
the injured travelers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a substitute bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck drivers and potential witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic meter of sewage are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ th@@ ahl , 3.@@ 44 instead of previously 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( previously 2,@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will increase once more if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after an over@@ estimated calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , when the budget was approved by the Kul@@ mb@@ ach District Office , it was noted that sub@@ missions for these sewage systems were covered .
due to legal bases , the market town of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the facilities in a cost @-@ covering manner .
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens and the industrial and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ th@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to access the pur@@ se .
the fee increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as Head of Administration , Herbert Schmidt showed the body , a new calculation of the fees for the waste water systems of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and / or sub@@ missions from the previous calculation period are to be compens@@ ed .
Schmidt founded the grave fee increases with the fact that all three wastewater facilities were relatively small , with a very small waste water treatment plant , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact on the basis of the low distribution base .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three systems is slightly dec@@ lining .
furthermore , due to their age , renovation and repair expenses in all three systems have fallen to a considerable degree not least due to their age .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ th@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p for almost 20 years .
Schmidt referred to the fact that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the sewage plant Az@@ endorf due to damage .
in the pumping station Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground , and after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage pond had to be dispos@@ ed of , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation system had to be installed in order to comply with the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period , came to these extraordinary expenses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were considerably below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water in the three plants , the expenses for operation and maintenance were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully hit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt , the market town of great entertainment costs in the wastewater facilities in the past 20 years has been spar@@ ed .
the situation for the mentioned facilities will remain prec@@ arious in the long term according to stone houses , especially since one cannot extend the supply area of the Fri@@ esen@@ bach tal wastewater association in order to not extend these facilities because it is a lack of defici@@ ent facilities .
Bulgaria books inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that in July , inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % posted .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; Transport ( 1.8 % ) ; Lei@@ sure and Culture ( 6.@@ 3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell by clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) .
prices remained as in the pre @-@ month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; -@@ effect critici@@ zed as Asian carto@@ on
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filtering tool , Snap@@ chat enables about 150 million everyday users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are un@@ infl@@ ated , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools generating more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ understand@@ ings reach the public .
in the past Snap@@ chat filters have critici@@ zed criticism in which they were accused of promoting the app Black@@ face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week passed a filter to some users who gave them s@@ lit eyes , false teeth and dark@@ ened che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ ish face . &quot;
they wonder@@ ed if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports of The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended to pay homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who experienced rac@@ ism reminded the filter of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és .
others deci@@ de@@ dly rejected the an@@ anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an email Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet about the photos were widely spread , wrote that the filter was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vulnerable and least unpleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filtration effects .
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish but that the yellow face was dra@@ gged into the descending extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling party .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are more different in race than their older counter@@ parts - could expect to expect sensitivity .
when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu decided , who works as a product manager and engineer for the medium to delete their Snap@@ chat account , and asked others to do the same .
in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview she said that they believe that race @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect lack of diversity in the attitudes practices of Snap@@ chat@@ ting .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the largely white , only male leadership and finished their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely left Snap@@ chat un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , it refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently set up a personnel manager focusing on un@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu also said she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it &apos;s not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership counter@@ fei@@ ts IS@@ IS intelligence , re@@ jects Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw an optim@@ istic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions were allowed on the ground , an inquiry committee of the Congress announced in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Committee of Defense , Secret Service Committ@@ ees and the Military Com@@ mit@@ ment Committee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence agencies who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to U.S. efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence gathering information , typically provided by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly called for a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it permitted actual conditions locally and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; what happened at the Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
the leadership mistakes in the Cent@@ com range to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed ongoing problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government officials under Obama have given instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts are exposed to the pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements made before the Congress were much more positive than the facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report noted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command heads changed the intelligence reports to play the threat of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans were calling the Task Force to live after it was as@@ cer@@ tained that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed insights while the investigation continues .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ com reports are underway by the Secretary of Defense &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ torate .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ com created an exc@@ essively restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the highest @-@ rate Democ@@ rat in the Kom@@ ats@@ ar , member of Adam B. Schiff &apos;s House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this process , such Mr. Shi@@ p , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; den@@ ounced the moral among analysts and &quot; gave excessive amount of room for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot;
but Mr. ship and the democr@@ ats gave no clu@@ es to the intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ com analysts in terms of a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon General In@@ spec@@ tor who had been in@@ gest@@ ed after complaints from Cent@@ com analysts .
l@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the reports of the Congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor were still underway .
but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful aerial campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document about how the former government under George W. Bush looked forward against the recommendations of many analysts only a small occup@@ ying force in Iraq , and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker estimates that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air@@ strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries had commissioned to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , reported the Times in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger Nach@@ l@@ sh@@ aber , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
the US win fourth match in the women &apos;s field ho@@ ckey , a show@@ down with Great Britain ahead
one day after winning three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
but she knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition and are also in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first place will take a little longer for the strong Dutch to lead the other group .
whatever the game ends on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising twi@@ ddle due to their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey club in her hands ( her two older sisters played sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , became coach of the national team and started to turn things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have completely ro@@ pped the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the local area .
India had gone into the game without victory , but the team showed surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then pulled into the middle and le@@ ashed the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 leadership .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the entire tournament for the US &apos;s keeper , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a goal in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , as late as it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and in@@ es@@ capable of being a fast relay between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick that is calibr@@ ated by the w@@ rist@@ band to float to the gymn@@ ast for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the conflict between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time with the Olympic Games and a s@@ warm with dimples , could well have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time based on sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even fen@@ c@@ ers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the olymp@@ ic sailing gymn@@ as@@ tics .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the center , some in the shadow are the sports which are not generally accepted : aerial pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the swimming pool and may it rule for a long time .
but if I would have enough arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although jumping on tramp@@ ol@@ ines has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had made his debut in Sydney , the last 16 years saw that many who had asked me did not know that there is an Olympic sport at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to competition , there has never been a medal in jumping on tramp@@ ol@@ ines and until 2012 it has had an ath@@ lete who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their Gold Med@@ al from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain outside charm , partly because it fits the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear suitable for a c@@ lown school than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ical trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the grace of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports which are essentially united .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , meaning as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging champi@@ ons jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , fen@@ cing and sal@@ tos ) before landing on the feet .
you will be evaluated according to the official Olympic program according to the execution , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot;
athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic V@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts in their quest for gold must go further , faster , up and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes up and down , upwards and down on the playground .
they not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the original wall , but also another mo@@ ver@@ able goal in the broad@@ cast@@ ers : the world or the Olympic @-@ record .
the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is noble , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator into tears .
but it is also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ing myself when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a breathing space .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition here , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant suspension of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition can only be for the Olympic Games .
the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also around 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the end rounds as part of a post block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
in the midst of the Olympic Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be over@@ looked in general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the an@@ gling and objec@@ tification of male athletes - as the male American gymn@@ asts recently proposed to the Wall Street Journal recently - Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his new fan community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one generation protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia viol@@ ated the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses testified that tens of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police when switching to fire@@ arms .
is Ethiop@@ ian just going to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more territories .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed millions of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos about the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Auth@@ orities requires a thorough investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the Project Manager of the Africa International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terror across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , and dissi@@ dents were forced to silence .
many were sent into exile , or sent to prison , killed or driven into the des@@ erts of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t supp@@ ress people and have no other options but prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ j@@ m Tes@@ home , a teacher in central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold in terms of power of the governing coalition .
following a far @-@ si@@ ghted vote last year , the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament .
at the same time tensions rise along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been forced more or less in recent years , can take advantage of the tur@@ mo@@ il and arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness explo@@ de after years of h@@ ink@@ y under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media since cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , which it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave up that they gathered so to protest .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons of e@@ ons the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from orthop@@ ae@@ dic@@ s mainly Christian high @-@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas .
but this is changing just too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to coordinate under one umbrella , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ us@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia illeg@@ ally dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third reason for the un@@ rest is Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi &apos;s death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was Prime Minister of Ethiopia until his death for 17 years until his death in 2012 .
he was considered a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ y Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively in@@ transparent grounds to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an uph@@ eav@@ al was in 2005 after thousands of prot@@ esters prot@@ ested against elections which , according to the statements of analysts , were apparently ple@@ dged by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the subsequent ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed even though it was less than in the past months and this time of ri@@ ots went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train and meas@@ urable advances in poverty reduction .
but evi@@ dently this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal gri@@ ev@@ ance of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it accepts a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , attacked by Tig@@ ray and hatred of the Tig@@ ray became increasingly common in social media .
analysts say that protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over neighboring Somalia , even if she recently announced that she has closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama was founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump on Friday tried to scatter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by fear@@ ing that his multiple repeated claims , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton , were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication threw new questions on the communication capabilities of the Republi@@ cans &apos; presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and understand@@ ably with the American public .
it also brings its fellow workers who strive to take care of him during an event@@ ful period , in the peculiar position to explain the statements which he could not have meant at all .
having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump made reference to the statement on Thursday and insist@@ ed in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret , the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the tweet was contrary to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the alleg@@ ation was completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted nothing of it .
the last storm of criticism falls down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while trying to direct the focus of his campaign for falling survey values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton had speeches on the business situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech bored .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians were to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s e @-@ mails , but he later declared &quot; Of course I meant sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic borders in politics and then to call back on demand .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the sound for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an estimated tone since his surveys have gone further .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leading edge in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative pron@@ ounc@@ ements , he often acc@@ uses his critics of distor@@ ting his statements or mis@@ interpre@@ ting his humor .
but while he is intensi@@ fying the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps j@@ okes have placed his loyal partners in the uncomfortable situation of having to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comment@@ aries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani for the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back @-@ bro@@ kers , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream Republi@@ cans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
prior to the campaign events held in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of lying around on each of his words and being pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats ap@@ ologi@@ ze for Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps as just another evidence that he was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
once dispos@@ ed of the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point returns
verb Cafe was a sh@@ ab@@ by café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could pay only cash that didn &apos;t have a Wi @-@ Fi , but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices came out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop front .
the soap business So@@ ap Cher@@ ie , which was sold in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
native inhabitants used it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel exemp@@ ted and Ver@@ b is now a soap store . &quot;
but if New York is changing , then it &apos;s also re @-@ invention .
a re@@ vit@@ alized club cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing co @-@ worker of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide money for a new out@@ sider , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot .
verb uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nis@@ hes such as cap@@ ers and sau@@ ces .
there are natural rice bowls .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old clients were also displaced by Willi@@ am@@ sburg prices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in the past and visited the verb on a regular basis .
even after pulling it to Green@@ point , she would take the road .
after the club closed , she opened the coffee bar for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it became clear to me that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she made a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and faithful customer since the start of the club in 2003 .
he went to work there and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth , every day , like a Swiss fo@@ b watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal always gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no res@@ ent@@ ment over the fact that the soap business had taken the old premises .
in fact , the owners of the soap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for bre@@ wing with the cold @-@ bre@@ w@@ ed coffee of coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we &apos;re going to go on offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new client has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he preferred to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbours will feel welcome .
the site also has other advantages .
a local juice restaurant wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ w@@ ed coffee in the bottle .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a nearby building .
a new verb is enough for many customers to receive their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed at the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee would feel like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a gourmet , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a f@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue , such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as a dessert a pr@@ une pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There was also a message to Americans about how to eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and both are food histori@@ ans .
Co@@ es &apos;s last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted from Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Ziegel@@ man nar@@ rates in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A decent meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag illustrates the American kitchen &apos;s history during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed culinary solidarity as they met with a repor@@ ter in Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , fri@@ zzy snack at Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the crash of the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick kil@@ n , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive slices , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mix ate .
when the repor@@ ter ordered h@@ ack@@ ers , this found the couple suitable for a discussion of the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and p@@ opp@@ y bread .
they were made from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; marks the way the country is dealing with it , not to be the land of land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food was a central theme for the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e beg@@ ged why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole recovered as a &quot; wonderful way , food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; bri@@ ck@@ man noted , as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
meat , which was the central point of American cuisine for years , became a rarely servi@@ ced luxury .
peculiar bl@@ ends were tried out , because a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious gr@@ ati@@ fication had priority over taste or even wholes@@ ome cooking skills .
during their research for the book , which includes recipes , bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish from that time , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular supplement at lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions fit not together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before or since , budget@@ ary econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics , from 1923 to 1943 - were similar to the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; home polic@@ y@@ makers &quot; and the challenge to transform pamp@@ er such as cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a festival of historic treats .
particularly tasty are the reports of the government &apos;s response to the star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ Me @-@ C@@ ake food stance .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s kitchen of his kitchen , he sp@@ ends like a million @-@ million man from the world to which he has become .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt may have committed the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to cancel an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the present of a house@@ keeper with no interest in tastes by Mr@@ s Roos@@ ev@@ elt said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , to deal with food , was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of the mother @-@ in @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example , how they could not throw food away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; bri@@ ck@@ man remembered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the blow of the wind .
after the plates were cleared at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt ate at lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , adding that it was a common trick to give modest recipes a nice name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone appeared rel@@ uc@@ t@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it did not taste bad .
Co@@ E won three times a set@@ back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in a bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar radic@@ ally dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died even in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group , which according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung so far saved nearly 60@@ ,000 lives .
29@@ 00 volunteers place their own lives in order to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and to first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil servant , showing him during an 11 hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbol in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he never saw himself as a hero , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me , this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die to save lives , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters were jet@@ ti@@ son@@ ed by four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district . one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven men suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now remove the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb so that children do not play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ hair@@ y usually only come to the surface in winter .
this Ha@@ i was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation aboard the research vessel S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie has only been born with 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1,@@ 220 meters .
only when it matters , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal speeds up to a full of 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this lifestyle , characterised by lon@@ el@@ iness , seems to be a patent for a high age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the scientific journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Science &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least by a Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein , of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , comments this life span which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evolutionary bi@@ ologist said long that Greenland &apos;s hair is st@@ ony .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland h@@ arks are hard to observe , after all they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter .
researchers know little about the Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie &apos;s lifestyle .
they measured their slow motion when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
this sh@@ arks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they might ch@@ ase sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice cream and look for cad@@ a@@ vers coming from higher water layers down@@ wards .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie , which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re was measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 method the l@@ enti@@ cular nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks .
this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins they contain are no longer renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably good carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ cular nucle@@ us .
their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear ar@@ ming tests prevented large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third tier of 220 centimet@@ ers in length , the l@@ enti@@ cular nucle@@ us contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons attempt , it should have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
in contrast , all larger Greenland h@@ arks in their l@@ enti@@ cular nucle@@ us had normal carbon @-@ 14 volumes generated by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record @-@ Ha@@ i could even be 3@@ 92 years old with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers of the length could al@@ locate an old age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and his age was determined at 156 years , Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie with the increase is obviously at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no coincidence that such methane em@@ bodies live mainly in icy waters .
also the record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Greenland w@@ ale , in whose sp@@ eck at the neck , stuck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon @-@ tip , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs into flame @-@ flame .
so they mature later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are also often very big .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than a gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal is therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the Dar@@ w@@ inian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ euer@@ lein &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal , on the other hand , should invest his resources more into a long life .
building site in double pack
in the recent session , the municipal council focused on topics related to building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the panel announced the release of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the marketing of the recently proven residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the land , par@@ cel@@ ing and closing questions were clari@@ fied and the applications for survey could be clari@@ fied , the sale of the land in the residential areas &quot; Road Path &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - extension section 1 ) is no longer in the way of interested parties .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au attract young families and elderly sen@@ iors in equal measure .
as it was said , building licenses can now be reported in the town hall , and the municipal council is expected to advise the municipal council during its September meeting .
in order to accommodate requests for res@@ ett@@ lement of other commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year in sub @-@ areas .
the industrial area , which has already been designated there , is extended by two plots in the direction of the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt profits from Bre@@ x@@ it
as a result , the city on the Main has the best chances to attract new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Financial Markets and Property Markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money stores continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , it is sufficient for them to have admission to the UK so far .
they are using big US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lob@@ b@@ ying association reck@@ ons with 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other major authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the venture ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , though , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proximity to the central bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg indeed conce@@ als a large fund business , but also deteri@@ or@@ ates in the infrastructure of Dublin as well as Dublin .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
in addition , the city with readily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , on the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than am Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition with good medical care and infrastructure and less crime .
in a ranking of the corporate consultancy Merc@@ er , the city was ranked seventh , Luxemburg in place 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even though quality of life is a matter of preference , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial hub for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my econom@@ ist .
the balance of forces also speaks for this : according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , at the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt they were 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs incurred by her from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co . Inc .
in June , Gilead was liber@@ ated from a compensation install@@ ment amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ vest@@ i of Gilead , after an American judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including opinion and other un@@ ethical acts .
when the complaint was collected on Thursday , US official judge Beth @-@ Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead claims to be at the expense of the costs that have ar@@ isen during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ alise with Gilead , which domin@@ ates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compl@@ ained each other and claimed property on laboratory work , which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir plain@@ ly claimed , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops supported by the US say they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j of the Islamic State
by the US , troops supported the complete control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left the city , a spokes@@ man of the group said on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are comb@@ ating after the removal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , currently the city .
they liber@@ ated over 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council , allied with the D@@ KS , shared with Reu@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are currently conducting clean @-@ up work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s earnings increase 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % of federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday its tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the Democrats &apos; candidate and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , Clinton donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton donated $ 5.3 million in speeches hon@@ or@@ ings ; the former Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his last ten years tax declar@@ ations together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; admitted Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false pron@@ ounc@@ ements and re@@ trac@@ ts with regards to his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations .
it is common for U.S. Pres@@ idential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations although they are not oblig@@ ated by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have given a tax check by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons election campaign hel@@ per Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter with regard to the publication of the Pres@@ idency candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Ad@@ vis@@ er , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish anything before tax inspections were not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , donations for ben@@ evol@@ ent organizations , his business shares and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already pl@@ ung@@ ed himself on the subject and published a video on the internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ cans Tr@@ ump asked to publish his tax return .
on Thursday , she also talked about the topic during a speech on the Mich@@ igan economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what each other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or very little tax during the 1990s , and a business journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday , stating that this could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would make sure that people who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in O@@ ma@@ ha last week , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , Tr@@ ump to meet their tax declar@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he had been subjected to a tax check by the I@@ RS and had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign released tax returns until 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid average an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40@@ ,5 % .
Clinton &apos;s tax return from 2015 showed that these were only USD 100 of their income as a reward , unlike most of the Americans .
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which Clinton &apos;s paid divi@@ den@@ ds and proceeds were tax@@ ed from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works support Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going in inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with chill@@ i powder .
the method has proven effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ Guide Foundation , who already had the idea years ago , intensified their promotion together with U.S. natural protection by trained volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and crops without har@@ ming animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is World Phone Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we have been able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , being much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the eleph@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hon@@ ey@@ maker Dam@@ ian Bell , managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ maker Dam@@ ian Bell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ lion cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mixed with earth is packed into a con@@ dom together with a fire@@ work body whose end is turned to the ignition circuit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a knob and spra@@ ys fine dust on chil@@ i powder into the air .
a touch is usually already sufficient to ch@@ ase the elephant .
a last possibility represents a thro@@ wer that shoots a gold mine fire into the air , causing a loud , light explosion .

however , the City Council unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the new construction of a sales office near the Rhine river in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine district under construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically we welcome new tra@@ des@@ men , but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director breaks Berlin &apos;s hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; appeal - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media clock after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin had not listed any Israeli pre @-@ election , as there were Arab guests according to one employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the hotel &apos;s list of countries .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the New Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel from its own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director looked at the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision by management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it triggered even more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pres@@ election be deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called it a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big shame &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in this hotel chain in Germany is even a major dis@@ grace .
there is no need for explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather large resonance on the internet , in which people called the whole thing a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indul@@ ge in the alleged requests of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is located near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all alleg@@ ations and called the incident an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Lanz@@ mann , The Mir@@ ror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct order &quot; to put Israel in the list box , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds that the country code is now added .
police sets tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
on Thursday , students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police deployed tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , causing the police to introduce rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , less than 100 public schools are closed while 300@@ ,000 students are being implemented to save money .
some of the prot@@ esters were seen gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the latest protests occurred a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets in masses to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade sum between Moscow and T@@ eher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the previous year .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies on businesses in the country grew strongly , the ambassador said .
Russian companies have established established ties with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the rate of trading between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports into Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was achieved through deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan assumes a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , the Russian foreign agency gave about 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries affecting the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record figures of Iranian tourists in Russia are broken off last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something from which the Ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .
sought @-@ after witnesses : beverage market falling over in forest br@@ oth
a rob@@ ber@@ y raid on Thursday evening has been committed to the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the au@@ spices of a fire@@ arm , three dark dressed people who had m@@ um@@ med their faces were demanding the return of cash by the employee of the beverage market and then fled initially on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
how much money has been captured does not divide the police .
the perpet@@ rators were supposed to have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters in size , so relatively small .
the beverage market is immediately accessible and poorly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
after the assault , the perpet@@ rators must be banned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and by the gravel parking space located opposite the parking @-@ house entrance with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in the direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( at 19.@@ 45 pm ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y attack , urgently need to report to the police .
Nag@@ old : fun and fun at summer time
the children and young people of the social educational daily group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their car@@ ers spent eight beautiful and happy days with their car@@ ers on their summer vac@@ ancy in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
the life @-@ joyful group was quartered during the first week of school holidays in the quiet area of Lei@@ th@@ nia .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , we went to B@@ recht with the visit of the stro@@ king zoo .
on the other side of Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s tour in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third excursion led to P@@ for@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and planning .
culinary delights were given to children and car@@ ers with their own homemade food such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ er Pf@@ änder , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
in workshops , beautiful pieces of jewelry made of beads and stones were created or made of wood a Roman mill game .
other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Color@@ ful E@@ ven@@ ing . &quot;
on the day of my hom@@ ebo@@ und voyage the sun laugh@@ ed and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : the Pil@@ gri@@ mage to the Gateway of Mer@@ cy
the regi@@ stran@@ ts from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage to Freiburg .
together four stages were dealt with .
in order to bridge the time up to the next pilgrimage of all three regi@@ stran@@ ts in two years , the Church of the Church of the Church of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations were tested and one finally decided for the dioc@@ ese of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered to the open portal of mercy on Freiburg Min@@ ster .

Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite won Gold for cycling
Scotland Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ced last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his fellow coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made his own . the young boy made the legend hau@@ ghty when he stor@@ med home to take home a victory of the favorites New Zealand .
England claimed a shock@@ ing victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic gold med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they brought in March at the Track World Championships in London despite Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff .
they did this in time as a hin@@ dran@@ ce .
Ho@@ y &apos;s retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man in which they remained as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y win - and Sk@@ inner placed an Olympic circuit in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ du was just back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y made the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a great part of the transformation , in which execution drove in a higher gear so as to slow it down and enable Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell to Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ di when they climbed to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an Olympic board in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys side , Hin@@ des admitted that after a weak start he intentionally dropped on the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement , and there was no obj@@ ection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
this time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole UK flags on the tri@@ b@@ une as London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we came together as a team in the last three months .
we have so badly gotten away with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of ten titles in both Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the cycle stream .
with the Form Tra@@ ys it is in the realm of possibility that he repe@@ ats the victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a contest .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same for Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ l qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race .
they arrived at the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition in which W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday he had agreed with representatives before the qualification when officials called him to measure his body size .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK Team relies on its strong team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a crowd of med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
drama in the background took place in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ tex@@ es as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
but if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom it looks like the now legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of the melt business of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy contract question@@ able
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator announces the contract of energy supply and thereby canc@@ els all supply contracts , such as the supplying energy company .
this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a 20 @-@ year subsi@@ dy will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa facility in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 work@@ places - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk in closing .
in addition , it could lead to dom@@ ino effects , as the melt company consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which led last year to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station .
the sm@@ el@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks closure .
this step follows years of spec@@ ulation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium sleeve with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three more owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L expects the plant to continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through melting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L also stated that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that should come into force as of November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a period of 12 months , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why AG@@ L expects the Tre@@ aties to contribute to revenue in the business year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on revenue for AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L announced that it had already written down the value of the Tre@@ aties in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expectation of a termination &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to withdraw the tre@@ aties , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ ility Al@@ co@@ as ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not affect anything . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. company said that in 2010 it had concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , who would have come into force from November this year even if there is still a statement found guilty of why it res@@ ig@@ ned from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the branch before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt business in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
in reference to analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land use some 600 MW and Tom@@ ago to consume around 900 MW of electricity a year .
if both plants van@@ ish from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in the demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , San Antonio is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
Antonio J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , Model and the fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US Vo@@ gue .
Antonio , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Antonio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the revelation of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an &apos;s similar ? ) , filmed reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the all @-@ popular show bi@@ z unc@@ le and producer of keeping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as she ends with a classic turn : they all planned a surprise party .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é act of almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in that publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun with certainty .
Kend@@ al &apos;s big sister Kim likes her , as far as the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West have been on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is the most sold issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that rather resembles an illustrated book than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Accor@@ ding to the 8@@ 32 pages of the novel 6@@ 15 pages advertisement ) .
the revelation of his cover @-@ star is expected so eag@@ erly that in the last two years , images of the journal were still se@@ eping before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there have been more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties that mo@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. J@@ en@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the previous category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous persons or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even though everything is true on J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who sign in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course J@@ enn@@ &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone .
with her reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos; position in the fashion world was always somewhat ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called them &quot; the Mist@@ resses of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings flas@@ hed up again when the news came out with the release of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but lying around on the mess seems to pass by at the point .
Antonio J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ ming by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters are selling pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal Service Centr@@ es al@@ locate 160 000 people every year
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s aid nec@@ essi@@ ties are rejected annually by the community centers , while the industry is preparing for the impact of further middle @-@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Que@@ ens@@ land three out of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair del@@ o@@ gi@@ zations and similar - are dismissed in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly utilized , are ready for further reductions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of June next year , these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the municipal institutions of Que@@ bec James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been dismissed each year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be wor@@ sen@@ ed without repe@@ aling the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people of important services that you need are rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been released by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help they need .
in June 2017 , the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of vulnerable people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Minister of Justice and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately lift these short @-@ cuts so that the people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the State Government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their customers , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused after employees allegedly drew gun
new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps Camp@@ aig@@ n has been accused of alleged in@@ activity after it was told that her head of campaign for North Carolina filed a gun at a staff member while traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the Charlotte &apos;s State Court by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i announced to have waited for months that the matter would be settled internally before it realised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drew a gun , put his right finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the barrel in Vinc@@ ents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he stated in his accus@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compl@@ aining to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four other people had had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons do not have to be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation came only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate released a ri@@ ot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arms and ar@@ cher friends - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judge .
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of the context and that he would not force himself to violence .
B@@ ordin@@ is &apos;s complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of duty of care and Philip for personal injury and lasting psychological damage .
Tr@@ um@@ ps press spokesperson on Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a statement .
attempts to contact Philip failed as well .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer an employee in the campaign .
responding to calls at his consulting firm , Innovative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has so far led a controversial campaign .
the procedure is B@@ ordin@@ i v. Donald J. Tr@@ ump For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses for the governing parties SPD and CD@@ U are apparent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition could barely rule in the north , this is not possible after the surveys in Berlin .
but in both states the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing to face the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD dropped from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party was only margin@@ ally ahead of the CD@@ U , which could rise again to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left came to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in parliament .
despite light losses , the Gre@@ ens were rel@@ uc@@ tant to return to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag in spite of slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented by 3 percent in parliament .
according to the survey , at the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the survey was only 23 percent ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
it is still lag@@ ging behind the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return , while the pir@@ ates would miss the entry in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in slow motion : 20 years ago Nokia Communic@@ ator launched on the market .
the success@@ ors dominated the world today - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , therefore it wasn &apos;t good either .
on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which today would suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to the shops exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euros lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in western pocket format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for the standards at that time : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , al@@ beit slow .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
quite proud the price was : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody was able to suspect in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story even if not for Nokia .
the mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold and handled by Microsoft .
today , the market is dominated by suppliers who all came much later than Nokia .
being online anytime and anywhere , this is day @-@ to @-@ day for a lot of people .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
selling some 1.4 billion devices , Samsung and Apple account for 5@@ 55 million units alone .
worldwide turnover with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry has been developed around the smartphone .
the crucial breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone at the Mac World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet communic@@ ator to easily operate everything by touch screen .
Apple &apos;s trium@@ ph@@ al march began , even today , the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look .
they eventually disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ wing is now Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after his invention .
on average , every German looks today 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to get the smartphone out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens Board for Human Resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as it was in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities , we alone will provide 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they were ahead of us in 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the He@@ ath@@ row expansion is too great .
I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be flo@@ cking on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any asked question .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in atmospheric growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and in the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to the T2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented walk@@ ways .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to ste@@ er this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding ad blocking
for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to circum@@ vent ad block@@ age are equal to a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad block@@ ings on its desktop , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that its desktop page would change the coding for its advertisements to make it difficult to detect which part of the page advertising is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ battle between the an@@ tim@@ ating open source community and the b@@ ans has already been underway since the invention of indicator block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook comes soon with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indication block@@ ers have become the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people use display lock@@ ers worldwide ; almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenue .
the company did not have it on desktop PCs because mobile ad block@@ ers did not have any effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a spokes@@ man .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large proportion of revenue , so Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ad Pre@@ ference Tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their advertisements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that blocks would be wor@@ rying new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we instead focus on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to get more control over people &apos;s hands .
woman considering presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police are calling for witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday exceeded the presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police told them , as well as every witness of the incident to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared with Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a clas@@ h avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not being held accoun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs on the motorway in the middle of the night as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent killing after a man over@@ took and killed a man lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street , took the court .
the court stated that the polic@@ ew@@ oman , who had responded to an emergency call -- went on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus once was hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably inhab@@ itable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA have developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have detected er@@ d@@ like conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ tight atmosphere .
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and still slowly turned on .
the model also lit up the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably stopped more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to house life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun , which was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of the Venus displays its daily side of the sun for nearly two months , &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously thought by planet explor@@ ers .
even though it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus -- over the course of billions of years --@@ was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned away from ultra@@ violet light .
as her hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy res@@ ig@@ ns as Trainer of A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy res@@ ig@@ ned as a coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che on Thursday and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations , Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the summer , I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give it more depth that it needs and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the trainer &apos;s vision and vice president of Hock@@ ey Operations have to be perfectly matched to the organization .
it must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today Patrick has informed me about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ acc@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
in his debut season Roy was awarded the Best Coach of the League during his debut season at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was hit in the first lap of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the last two years the post@@ season .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 stamp in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference by five points .
in Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two songs with the Montreal Canadi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , strike out strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour disputes relating to wages for North Sea workers are exposed , while all parties sit down for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adic@@ ally carried out on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group and the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT Uni@@ ons can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current strike &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is said in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold several full @-@ day meetings in the coming weeks that will start at the beginning of next year in order to restart the problems .
the trade unions told that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has reduced rates to its tractors in the North Sea by around 9 per cent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rate reduction is followed by a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the UK energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that had been reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliament member , Dave Anderson , met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest labour disputes that had taken place in the North Sea since one generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of some $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers gather the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates below the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars rotate in star @-@ loops to different rates and in what context the rot@@ ational periods are associated with the formation of the planet .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star enh@@ ancements , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is located 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the earth .
many stars in this cluster of stars , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
they are turning the fastest now .
to peak rot@@ ational rates , these mat@@ uring stars po@@ ke large amounts of star win@@ ches .
since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
when a star is aged , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars are turning slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars turning slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still much to tell us about how , how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades rotary rats that will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of base to base .
after his emotional withdrawal , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will wear the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say &apos; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game participant in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract awarded him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid back a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he made some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics .
nevertheless , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be included in the Hall of Gl@@ ory of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was so successful - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the square .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star was entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to have taken forbidden ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was banned for 211 games in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal at the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect to have received funding from an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida for many years .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez back at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his f@@ arewell @-@ days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends have received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bench frequently .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job ent@@ ails an attempt to win any game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ard@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the relationships with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , got sympathy from the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ arch @-@ ri@@ vals Boston red So@@ x .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; sang the followers at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez @-@ Team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympia 2016 : little X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland can not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing events .
a learned ath@@ lete would almost have won a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing events in Rio de Janeiro are known .
Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter Obst@@ et@@ eer Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already cri@@ tically accepted athle@@ tics competitions these news are coming to an end .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de was detected last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
the International Sports Court , CA@@ S , confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had finished fourth in the final over 100 m of butterfly , only about 0.0@@ 9 seconds she missed the bronze med@@ als .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have attended more than 50 m of fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands full co @-@ operation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sanc@@ tioning of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ ova sp@@ oo@@ ked by , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive for himself .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ath@@ lete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the forbidden substance should be the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
for the time being , Dan@@ ek@@ ova was suspended , according to the B@@ NT , the B @-@ test should also have been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately sent word to the ath@@ lete with criticism .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes are not pulling the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing poll@@ uting nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both denied the intake , but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before starting the athletes , especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF world association banned the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , and also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in swimming sport , in addition , the earlier settlements in China caused serious confron@@ tations among athletes as well .
Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Y@@ ang Har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I see the podium above 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to commit myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focal point of a discussion with Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positive for the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ de in 2014 in the Chinese Championships , but only had to sit down for a three month lock .
data c@@ law : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail h@@ ack@@ ers her ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ mail malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and they are successful .
according to a recent survey by the malware anti @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the companies surv@@ eyed over the past twelve months were at least once , sometimes victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware solution .
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som demanded by the perpet@@ rators to re@@ use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes to attack company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially high @-@ pressure release money is significantly higher than for private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Head Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski talking to the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 most of the malware programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
first , private users were the target , but the change@@ over to company attacks was terri@@ fying fast in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files and archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and er@@ ase the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
to get the end turn code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin .
but where private users find the personal photo database at stake , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops .
the damage is correspon@@ dingly higher if a ran@@ som@@ ware fails .
22 percent of affected German companies reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had to completely inter@@ rupt the business operation , in one case people were in danger of life .
several hospitals in Germany have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always tell the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the perpet@@ rators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demands &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers in turn know that and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure tested the user interfaces and contact with black@@ mail extrac@@ tors and came to the conclusion : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money .
they explain their cas@@ u@@ alties by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support sites or dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t free sample files for free .
and if private individuals are redeemed after payment of a few hundred euros , businesses have to negotiate heavily and pay five @-@ digit amounts in order to recover their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more and more professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware roughly within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software building kit to the actual black@@ mail .
the malware test created earlier by purchasing the malware itself , providing advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included in delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ mail then searches for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so one logs in one of the boards on the ground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with dis@@ semination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the ter@@ ab@@ ytes survey rely on them to be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption is no longer a threat to successful recovery , the perpet@@ rators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Head Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the type of data , the potential for damage is much higher than before .
even in the future , the perpet@@ rators could completely take on new targets in the internet of things on the grain .
at the con conference of Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could certainly be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ rators , instead of heating in the future , block an entire production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and even the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear , it does not work closely at any place .
the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the top of the cockpit is slightly different .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage box .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l for upright and 10@@ 26 l with inver@@ ted back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical when it sounds : the seats of the rear bench can be folded up like kin@@ os@@ ols and thus offer storage space that is 1.@@ 24 metres high from the floor to ceiling .
the luggage compartment can be loaded well , however , the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he should do his job a bit qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; variant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety systems include the City emergency braking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane assistant .
the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates , because when maneu@@ vering , he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the smart tem@@ por@@ ter respon@@ ds to traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles if necessary the speed .
but full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore slightly cum@@ ber@@ some .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel is fine .
those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol station from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday vehicle .
airline is not responsible : down@@ fall to passenger lift bridge
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that a liability is conceivable only in the case of dangers that are typical of aviation .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down a knee cap during the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline did not have to pay compensation for the man .
case of illness : when paid by the organis@@ er
sick leave will only get money after their trip if the cause of the disease is found without a doubt in the hotel .
this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms .
in the case that the case was negotiated , a family had suffered from diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their stay in Turkey .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness brought the holi@@ day@@ makers back to a defective treatment plant , which allegedly poll@@ uted sea@@ water .
the family thought that the trip was thus defective - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
plain@@ ti@@ ffs were not successful in court .
indeed , the sewage treatment plant was in fact defective .
but the organizer only learned about it shortly before the departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ff .
until then , he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
so he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the verdict .
no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion - belonged to the general risk of living .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said , following the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be pru@@ dent and determined to react on terror at the same time .
it is certain that our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and division .
we will not treat this triumph to the terrorists .
if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country faster , this will increase safety and strengthen the population &apos;s approval for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals until the election of the Bundestag in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced further personnel recruitment of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ eastern magnitude for several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must again be under penalty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance should be improved , the gun rage has been modified to make the purchase of weapons on the internet more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last much discussed tail light for doctors is said to be preserved according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
however , he wants to look for solutions in the dialogue with the medical profession , as the endanger@@ ment of the citizens can be reduced , he said with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities .
in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ sed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of concealed investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD leader Gabriel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the interior minister clearly spoke against action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union following a Bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double citizenship .
it is a general prohibition of full @-@ wear for constitutional law .
you can &apos;t prohi@@ bit everything you refuse and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about traffic or for witnesses in court .
green boss Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister of simul@@ ating action force and capacity to act with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror p@@ act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ wing party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right of stay bring people in this country no longer safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway bridge
it st@@ alls regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal regulation should be extended .
this is good news for all car enthusiasts who are in traffic on the ambient road every evening in traffic jams when they drive over the highway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th of August ) , the road construction will be extended by 700 metres to the right lane in the area between the Hammer road and the Wes@@ eler Straße exit .
drivers can then turn right from the hammer road on the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is divided in the early days , thereby improving the total running time on the busy section of the federal road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of the Mu@@ enster @-@ West district .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder makes the driver nervous especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the return traffic goes up to the bridge across the Alber@@ o way and sometimes beyond .
reason is the needle @-@ eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ er Straße .
from here , the traffic is driven only one lane by way over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back well three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required load capacity to absorb heavy heavy traffic in two lanes .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the resulting work @-@ day traffic jam is going to last can &apos;t be said by the competent state company .
however , it is worth to reck@@ on with years : for the bridge has an official remaining service life by 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legislative activity , the state company consciously chose the more traffic @-@ less time during the school holidays because of the disabled .
the traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural Activities for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das invisible Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a musical project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association allows young people with immigration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Children &apos;s House Wald@@ schule has visited the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the boy &apos;s theater in Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s 19 students between eleven and 15 years visited the st@@ aging in the Small House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims at the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most young@@ sters of the class have come to Münster from September 2015 to March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , according to the press release of the boy &apos;s theater in Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg of Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project .
between October and December , young people with and without a migration background between 14 and 20 years will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
special offers for children and families in theatre play and theat@@ rical placement are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association reck@@ ons with many classes that want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of the weather
the weather has taken the star @-@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany on the night to Friday by the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was bad due to clouds and rain to watch the sky spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope lies on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are per@@ sei@@ ds , which are one of the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they appear to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the northeast .
relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
in the evening , one rolls around etern@@ ally , at night one is awake for hours , in the morning it is not enough to think of sleep even far before the alarm @-@ ring .
it &apos;s all but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleeping problems or sleep problems manifest themselves ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes behind them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ emer , member of the Executive Board of the German Society for sleep and sleep medicine .
what one understands for the time being , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. a single and sle@@ e@@ pless disorder .
even diar@@ rho@@ ea can perceive many people as un@@ satisfactory or insufficient , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , member of the board of the German Domestic Medical Association with practice in Var@@ el , Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind them can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medication .
in@@ frequently , sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early w@@ aking is common in case of depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ek@@ shot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors are mutually dependent .
those who , for example , have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be bad , w@@ akes up every two or three hours and starts to sal@@ ve about everyday problems and worries , fire gives an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I become a doctor with sleep disorders ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor , advises runners .
the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is worn off , tired , not slept , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or bodily problems such as stomach or headache .
in order to relieve the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medication - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
Dr. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary S@@ leep Medicine Centre at the Char@@ ité University Hospital , Berlin , has hardly been laid down in Germany .
this is why you should first contact the family doctor if you have problems with sleeping .
it can be clari@@ fied with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep lab , and what happens ?
for example , doctors advise doctors in the sleep lab , for example , in snor@@ ing with short@@ com@@ ings , in cases of abnormal fatigue , in case of sleep@@ wal@@ kers , or if you do not find the cause of a breakdown distur@@ b@@ ance , explains Fi@@ etze .
you don &apos;t have to prepare yourself for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please don &apos;t take a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after cl@@ inging you go to bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose go@@ ggles , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
in addition , a camera sits on the ceiling to sleep .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep .
fire is important : regular sleep and stopping times , don &apos;t lie too long in bed , don &apos;t sleep on the day , don &apos;t watch TV to sleep , avoid alcohol and don &apos;t look at the clock at night - then you start immediately , and that &apos;s not condu@@ ci@@ ve to it .
what the jungle camp has to offer with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing end of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he took gold for the first time at the short track world champi@@ onships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has secured himself against his ex @-@ team@@ mates standing in the criticism via Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic Champion gets 20,000 € Premium and a j@@ unk King 150@@ ,000 € should not be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page in the night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pumping system in swimming sport is bad , the dop@@ ing controls on the other hand are very good .
with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look closely at the subject of dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler had to be registered nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly the case with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not have a certain time before WM / OS of independent controllers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , it must not take part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the election ham@@ burger , which meanwhile operates an ice cream par@@ lor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : gang of luggage racks arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday , the police officers of the Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men aged 50 to 61 .
the susp@@ ects had done several hand@@ ker@@ chief and baggage theft as a gang .
at 09.@@ 30 hrs , civilian officials recognized a gang in the area of Düsseldorf Airport , which was known to the police from past theft charges .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July and participated in a collective , work@@ able and particularly professional manner .
the specialists of the Criminal Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can demonstrate four deeds to the Di@@ vers who have entered Germany to commit criminal off@@ ences .
in doing so , they had a total of over 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a few lin@@ den trees , in between still a remainder of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not seem so at first glance , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
when one walks along the road from east to west , one passes play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has spra@@ yed on the façade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite of a Li@@ dl , which is soon to be demoli@@ shed , it is already built : until 2017 a house with large windows and 133 new flats is to be built here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain calls , will , however , be preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin inner sen@@ ator Henkel has argued for a hard action by the police against the project , the area known as a &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the Cad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been cleared with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ rol three weeks official statements with 30 to 40 officers and three team cars on the ground , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners , the building workers were renov@@ ating the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later the police and construction workers moved under the che@@ ering of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon , the road seems peaceful : parents go for walks with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about late late .
in the immediate vicinity of the house there are a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left @-@ hand violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the neighborhood since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who is raising three children here , are especially anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern for rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , which mostly wanted police protection from the v@@ and@@ alism on the left .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police open between house occup@@ ants and their neighbors , obviously does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which , in comparison to the rest of the city , has a low average income and a high risk of poverty .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Straße in the vicinity of the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer was cleared in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and poll@@ in@@ ers from all over the world : residents of East Germany and former domestic servants now share their neighbourhood .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : they can be seen on inserted pan@@ es or freshly painted facades , which were thrown by colour explo@@ iters .
no other road was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; left @-@ autonom@@ ic violence . &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours to consider this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : crimes like physical violation tend to be directed almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the biggest part of the criminal off@@ enses cause damage , which tend to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who for 17 years lives in a rented house next to the disputed 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as for violence , it is wei@@ ght@@ lifting : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are definitely not .
even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rig@@ a@@ er .
for the architect , her street is not a criminal point of burning , on the contrary : &quot; here , one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more apart from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and remains .
that &apos;s why it was so important to her that residents get back their streets : from police , politics and the media , who suddenly took up the interpretation sovereignty over the city in July .
but in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer the street will continue to be taken away from them : through fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former buildings that are displac@@ ing the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many people here - people who are not so well contaminated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can absolutely not appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should we do if someone never list@@ ens to it ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for those who are drawn by colour bombs : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who pull up should be aware of this - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub area that can complain about noise .
all persons presented with first names have asked to not be called with their correct name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the new Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner for integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es for Ur@@ bach .
the social educ@@ ator supports the team of management for Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working groups refugee assistance , administration , authorities , and who else interven@@ es .
Reg@@ ine client of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is there , the ice @-@ loving wool mel@@ ee , which is above all a problem .
for instance , some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ed than rather on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
we were looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with many years of experience in the field of social work , just a cutting @-@ off wo@@ ollen mil@@ ky .
but administration work is not her central area , writes Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has limited a 50 @-@ percent position over three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports both honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
soon there are new containers in the Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for connecting refugees who have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
they must place the refugees in their own or rented quarters .
the costs of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these lod@@ g@@ ings must be borne by the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Local Government &apos;s Office to the Commun@@ e and Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
in fact , the administration does not find private apartments .
until now , it doesn &apos;t work , it depends on private dwell@@ ings such as Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore common apartments have to be in@@ timi@@ dated as it is so beautiful .
new containers will soon be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be explored or set up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many work in the building yard or help house@@ keepers , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no occupational therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so it needs offerings such as sport , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so there are administration and volunteers here as well .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the proceedings is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example by language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever develops the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach can &apos;t work and be useless , he will never integrate himself .
the clear majority was motivated .
but there are problem cases too , &quot; says customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people in whom nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : are they afraid of radic@@ alisation after the latest occur@@ ren@@ ces , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine &apos;s client quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some may call na@@ ï@@ ve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they are afraid that the assass@@ ins will bring them completely into retri@@ eval .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so managers and volunteers must look for jobs on site and in the region .
they always have in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants would soon come to Ur@@ bach .
do Germany need an upper limit ?
the policy is afraid to answer this question clearly .
actually it is unfair to put them on site hel@@ pers .
&quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bach@@ s are already at full capacity to integrate the old people in a reasonable way .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but if people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : burg@@ lar@@ s looking for helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew off several areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are forci@@ bly penet@@ rated into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 am .
the residents surprised the two and hit the bar@@ ren back in flight .
the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ ked , wore both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black hoo@@ dies .
they fled towards the city center .
at the time of the search , the police deployed several strikes and a police helicopter .
the search took place without success .
perhaps the unknown were actually falling close to the apartment or when they fled .
Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg : police determined after Ro@@ cker attack on I@@ mb@@ iss
after an attack on an Ul@@ mer I@@ mb@@ iss , the police investigate six susp@@ ects from the ro@@ cking environment due to serious breach of land .
in the case of housing searches , evidence and drug ad@@ diction were ensured , the police announced on Friday .
according to police in July around 20 mas@@ ked men of a rock @-@ like group@@ ing had thrown bottles and stones against the window @-@ window of an icon .
after that they were to attack two guests and hurt one .
