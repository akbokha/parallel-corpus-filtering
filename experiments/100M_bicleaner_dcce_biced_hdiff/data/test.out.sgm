<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer was looking for a little change with some colleagues on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden Sportpyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their celebrations, they drove home to the food-troughs in the fast gallop.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And this ended the riding career again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany was the best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He had his family run over the plant of the ALRV, he didn't even bother on a horse for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and therewith also at the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was absolutely convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the context of a small gala, German sports aid presented the Golden Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards to the likeable athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Federal Cross of Merit, Silver laurel leaf, champions-tour-player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already roamed him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">"" "" "" "invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade deal - both Clinton and Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">However, both US presidential candidates are divided against tax and energy policies, as well as in a fundamental demand.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton become a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Who, on the role of the State.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep those in doubt small and warns about how the state of the economy can do harm - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the contrary, would be quite different, claimed Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will drive back on a massive scale and he will be strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, states that the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich would increase, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the need to invest, Trump and Clinton say almost verbatim.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical shutdown of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, there could be party internal discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">Distinctions are the differences in energy and climate policy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump plans to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, the Paris climate agreement wants to terminate.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton, on the other hand, plans to explicitly expand and demand renewables with its investment program:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want we to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too distant from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the deiving trade agreement, do not want to sign them.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both, however, do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be paid better then, according to Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must arise, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion in the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens, stands for boosting growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics argue that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants to demand at least from the rich that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence is for women who are fleeing alone, almost everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby that is only one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in his arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.</seg>

<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the Area Managing Director of Condrobs, a sponsor of social services in Bavaria, and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are chicken.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentral shelters for single-fledged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs opened up the institution together with Pro Familia and the Women's Aid in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently, it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="24">"" "among women there are other reasons for the escape:" "" "many steal away secretly for seeing no other way out." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, volunteering, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>

<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Those who believe that the end, as soon as they come to Germany, is irre, recounts Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too single women in refugee camps are often considered inferior and at worst misused.</seg>
<seg id="32">This means that around 90 per cent of women who live in the accommodation in the Munich north are traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "some of the children surely did not come up voluntarily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women were so used to saying nothing.</seg>

<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answered with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia there is no such thing in the accommodations of the Governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Swabia alone, fleeing women are not accommodated separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesperson for the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia there are stories or own houses only for single women and their children in some community shelters.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistance physicians have called on their union to approve new work campaigns in their dispute regarding a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire council to approve more labour campaigns starting at the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC stated that ministers had agreed to deal with the concerns regarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">In July, assistant doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in favour of the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the president of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had "persistently calmly" had problems which led to the rejection of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "In view of this, the JDC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and solicit official new negotiations on all your concerns." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Board today submitted a formal application for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a running program of escalating working conditions starting at the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disputes led to the fact that assistance physicians struck six times this year, the first total failures in the history of the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="11">The director of the BMA Assistant physician Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contractual terms recommended by the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="12">He shared BMA members during the sessions which took place before the vote by 54,000 resident doctors and medical students, so that the contract should be advantageous and should be accepted.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and proclaim an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin is receiving his Turkish counterpart in the gilded Hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed to be dazzling and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if something bad happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's beaming, sustainable coolness showed that the head of state of Russia had forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductions: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was rage.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin informed Ankara, accused Ankara of having fallen behind Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater, as it was done by an alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Re-building the veto will be difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the state-controlled media launched a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations from senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could win a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was dismissed from his office after a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week the national TV forecast cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A Vedemsti report formulated it as follows: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West, as it considers its reaction to the attempted power takeover as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this end, the persistent resentment of the worm's pace of accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian head of state gained a bonus for claiming that after the attempted coup d'état, he demanded support for the elected state institutions.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit meeting in this splendid palace on the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present an alliance of outsiders: two countries that are driven by the West and feel ill treated and now unite.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be significant that after almost three hours of first talks, both presidents met at the press conference that they hadn't even stripped the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question of their differences while Putin chose to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster - when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state will at least talk to each other again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian President Putin fired Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin recently fired his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was a part of Putin's narrow trust in many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed as Special Envoy for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it reads that Putin has ordered" "" "the dismissal Ivanovich's dismissal of his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been a deputy for Ivanovich since 2012, has been appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is said (in Russian) that he was later the protocol manager and staff leader of the governing board.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state for bills and checks to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time one of the closest confidant Vladimir Putin and works as he did for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on TV, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was touted as a potential president at once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - trust post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV assumed the item in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he most trusted.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia, because a third term Putin violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another exceptional ally, Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became president again three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="4">Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, publicly apologized on Thursday before the announcement of his dismissal.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensbury crossings to the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closure of the" "" "Deck blowers" "", "approaching each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 incline ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1,35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building Queensbury crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witness to an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">A total of 79% of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck is given a concrete shot for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">In this fantastic project, the closure represents forward-looking high and low construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the expansion of the north tower, we had to close the gap in the north or the country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern bringers bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massively, as the Viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approx. 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate since the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.</seg>
<seg id="20">Fortunately, everything went very well.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is installing cheap apartments in Braunschweig?</seg>
<seg id="2">"" "" "" "the SPD and the Greens mean: investors are expected to become much more accountable in the future." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Brunswick will lose nearly 1,300 budget apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "the SPD suggests" "" "living in action" "" "at the next council session." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But argument is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, a regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said S & D Group president Christoph Frmann:" "" "we agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas will have to show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments can, however, also arise in the inventory.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "however, the big point in the town hall is," "" "said Bratmann:" "" "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces, but as much as 20 percent of homes as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing construction program, which will cost millions and still have to be financed, will provide incentives for incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem, so Bratmann:" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">No matter what, so viola, a tightening of the situation is on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, this will take care of additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is not entirely clear: the 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how can we offset the loss of some 1,300 favorable apartments whose funding will expire in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this from happening, the planning policy spokesperson, Nicole Palm, should now be purchased from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought to bring apartments back to the price binding.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke, the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western city, deadlines run out at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Approximately 1800 apartments could be picked up there in the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased again, one is removed from the goal of so-called mixing.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no concentration of socially disadvantaged people in only a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens reckon that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "group leader Holger Herlitschke says:" "" "for a broad majority, the CDU must go into the boat." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">This has been concentrating on more construction sites for single-family homes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens has been complaining of many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I naturally refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture decreased interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July something.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was shifted by the massive demand overloaded by the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokemons that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger joined the cock and jumped for the search from the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the U.S., the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" "" "average" "" "person restores each day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that followed 35,000 users, reported to the Washington Post recently that within two days of market launch, the number of tracked people, who exercise every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokemon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to get" "" "take 30 minutes" "", "" "" "coming from the sofa" "" "and" "" "active every day" "" "hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and come from people looking miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overestimated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokemon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that they enjoy.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health are thus covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also sullen game spoilers, which have to complain about something over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it supposed to?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit could follow our activity earlier, they didn't give us any reason to play sports as it does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be diminished over time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Thanks to Pokemons's success, however, there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant on the whole.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now, finally, Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast acquitted on Thursday for the multi-battle title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team Cameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles turnt on the Swedish bar during the multi-day campaign of women in gymnastics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Bilo is the fourth heterosexual American woman, who wins a multi-campaign title and the fifth, while she consolidates her call to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Bilesh has dominated the last three years, 15 World Championship medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals, which include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Mary Lou Rescue Team said she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She was expecting a final exam in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Do not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be regarded as disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the women's solo courses at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bilo took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as exclamation mark on the farewell ceremony of the team coordinator Martha Karolyi who retired.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although it insisted that during their long journey to the top of never having planned the future, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music, which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympiad Arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl adopted by her grandparents as a small child and trained by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion into the gymnasium, trained in Boorman, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has not lost any more competition, a winning streak that will continue as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafa was able to lead through two turns, the picture was deceptive.</seg>
<seg id="27">Suspended bar and ground floor - in which Bales holds the world title - lurking.</seg>
<seg id="28">She recovered again with 15,433 on the Swedish bar - and had another 15,933 on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her softly as she expected her final bump - a pure formality - and tears streaming on Biles brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision that she once described in her book-book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medals in a Tiebrake went to Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "this time the 22-year-old team captain, called" "" "Oma" "" "by the Americans, had a lead." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">After her floor exercise, she threw Kusshausen, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes appeared dubious.</seg>
<seg id="33">As far as Bilateral is concerned, the rapidly expanding Tweet of the 19-year-olds has a very new meaning at the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, who died in one of Phoenix's most deadly attacks for a decade, while they stopped in the car and listened to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12th, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a hand-fired firearm while he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police told me that the threefold murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery over all because the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900, which were owned by one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police spokesperson at Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting caused the investigators to take a closer look at whether it is linked to four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In total, seven people were killed in Hispanic residential districts within four months and two others were injured.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it happens in a residential area in front of a house," told Howard the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissans from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investigators refused to reveal the evidence they brought to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died still on site.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report on the shooting which dropped on an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of serial killer.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators found protector sleeves and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment.</seg>

<seg id="18">But it is not a typical sign language -- it says. Edmund has invented some characters on his own.</seg>
<seg id="19">Microcephalia has a variety of causes: genetic such as Edmund and infection with viruses such as measles or zicoavirus during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="20">The symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Zikavirus infected.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine under the women's Olympics in the gymnastics and for more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, since 1984 I took part in every summer Olympics and the USA had never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who were inspiring many young girls in other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew and Madison Kocian, who is Catholicin, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic feminine presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one female Turner was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were expecting unexpected but masterly gyrotic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American woman who won gold in an individual event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but so gymnasiums in the whole country do not look like.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie took the same path as Aly and Madison to join the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympic team will have only four runners in the team. moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But reality looks so that gymnastics is an expensive sport and attracts Turner primarily in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, registration, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued at will.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these sports clubs lie in prosperous suburbs, which can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer by Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to give the communities innumerable, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easy-to-reach gym workout.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastics for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youngsters (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest for the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of Girl Power through the Holen of the Olympic team and thank you for getting so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistant doctors would like to organize more strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunts's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in the election rejected him.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt's plans had vowed to forcibly introduce the contract and said that the NHS would be found in a "Niemandsland" and that any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first veterinarians will receive a new contract, which contains changes to night and weekend stays in order to improve maintenance and maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, chairwoman of the BMA Committee for Assistant Doctors informed the last night in a communication: "assistance physicians have still raised serious concerns to the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat the current crisis and administer it to treat all physicians."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract, progress must be made and time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes through talks have been met by the government for the sake of adversaries, and sometimes silenced to deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">This happened after a promise made by Jeremy Hunt at the end of the month that his door would always be open.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "Jeremy Hunt must act now, raise awareness and address the cares of the assistance physicians." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">If he fails to do so, the doctors made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 times, since nurses and specialists were involved to provide coverage for clinicians.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting the reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA proposes a better weekendsetting for the 54,000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, General Manager of the NHS employee, urged the assistant doctors to stop the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mortimer said: "labour-fighting measures do not reach anything but little, but already strain overburdened teams and service providers and prepare the patient, foster parents and their families only sorrows, distress and interruption."</seg>
<seg id="16">In the last two months we talked to the committee of the assistant doctors and responded positively to the health ministry as well as other ministries to the concerns regarding tutelage and whistleblowings.</seg>
<seg id="17">Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training, training courses, mutual recognition of curriculum, training vacations and gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers, health education England and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffer from a heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that form coverings.</seg>

<seg id="11">Individuals who have had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another risk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more likely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The initial draft of NICE, which was published today, recommends a 12 month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Healthcare Assessment Centre, said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person's quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows that in combination with aspirin, Ticagrelor is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information about the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutsk Rahman was removed last year on the dismissal of a government report due to corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political Correctness has shown that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is unknowingly ignored as a crushing government report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town councils to ignore evidence of electoral abuse on the basis of "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an answerer, said that the intimidation of voters from religious subjects would be so bad that it should be permitted by the police to set off barrier tapes outside of election booths to protect intimidated voters.</seg>

<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet Election scandal in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special electoral commission decided that the incumbent mayor of Lutsk Rahman was to be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Tribunal found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical manner" and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman said: "his campaign is based on the fact that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose it."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of an imitation in which one person chooses to be someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there would be evidence of fraud across the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He expressed himself especially alarmingly to the fraudulent election of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, mapped, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including leading out to prove identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report it says: "as proof that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the older, in particular communities with Pakistan or Bangladeshi backgrounds.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a bit more secure for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We spoke to Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you are approaching from front or rear, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your predator.</seg>
<seg id="5">When you are approaching from behind, you should turn around as first so that you can see your attacker and "go out of the firing line," says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then hit him with the knee in the groin and twist while the attacker is bent against pain, the weapon from his hands. hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while directing the weapon to him.</seg>
<seg id="8">For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot, grab the weapon and twist them so that the attacker cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and beat the attacker to the chest, then twist the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon to him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly how it preeminates Mizrachi.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright shabt for a guide his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent serious examination of his immune system and worms by leaking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk fired his train on a Euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a dishwashing button on a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before plugging in any object he used a luminaire to show himself and us what he is going to get in.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought surprising results.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of replacing the sink of a pull toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his trip through Europe Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he tasked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his bowel by travelling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railings at stations to sinks of toilets, the task has definitely put his immune system under a test</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said:" "" "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was in any case justified.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial line showed a luminometric rating of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the Luminometer number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to refuse, after the luminosity of more than 4000 units was, while fresh washed hands have one out of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "that comes close to the worst thing I have smelled in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune systems.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we really wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to see and at the same time explaining the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we performed crazy brainstorming, which ended with saying" "" "Call us Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking only about the products, we wanted to put them into a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the film's directing, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I have instructed him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian there, drown them and others, in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty delicacies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio from 2015, 84 percent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said that they occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">A asociale family left their social housing after delogizing with a loss of £50,000 because it had terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were cast after a long list of complaints from her estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing association found property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had gaping holes, wooden planks were torn up, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared on the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that it is now in private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for housing estate at Cornwall Housing, said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I believe that people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is thought to be regarded as not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons living in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted on street fights with baseball bats, intimidated residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive cries, disputes and cures.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name stood on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate, where drugs were used in the past, the wooden floorboards were torn open</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours testified that they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called regularly to the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delogierte she and her partner violently from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogization was acclaimed by lightened neighbors who said that their lives were made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "one said," "" "They didn't care for anyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years alongside them and it was always bad.</seg>

<seg id="22">We got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that!</seg>
<seg id="23">Now that they are finally away, it will be nice.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, stated that it had given the family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals, 20 years</seg>
<seg id="26">Rubbish and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the church building</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "it is a shame that the tenant agreed to accept any responsibility for her behavior and family, as a delooning is always the final step that Cornwall housing considers.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme and their actions for their neighbors had to be scared.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community courageously sent to us and gave us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbors and that the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress, which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after delooning on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the house administration will now have to sweep away the garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as weighers, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon was fined after having found guilty of the possession of a class B drug in commercial intent.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">After they were without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and their partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many of the walls of the house were graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police says that she will delegate tenants who do not stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow of the police of Devon and Cornwall announced that the delogization is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "this goes to those who think they can behave without reproach, as well as those who have been harmed by such behaviour," "" "she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="7">This was reported to the team leader Kenias of doping control engineers.</seg>

<seg id="18">Before the summer games in Brazil, the world anti-doping agency exerted a great deal of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals won't get anything from the summer campaign - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote on the parliament day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">Until 2021, the Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">More stupid than it has ever been: summer holidays, heat and land competition - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be persuaded by the electors, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Ruegen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so should not choose the land day.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers, posters hang up, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count towards the end, only laborious.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4th, 2016, the polling and final day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again pass an election campaign among the people over themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of the SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is exciting how strongly newbie apops truncate and what remains at the end of coalitionable.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, distributes roses and talks a little with the people, just as his legendary eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff also did.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "their refugee policy, their" "" "We create this" "" "hastened the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the most beautiful ministry." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make an election campaign at the right time at the right time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited chancellor Angela Merkel to big events twice; Merkel's federal election circuit is in the north-east.</seg>

<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the Union also noted that in the country you are crumbling the base that it needs to be very strict, to find a wire to the people again." ""</seg>

<seg id="27">The Council of the CDU-campaigner Kokert is also self-exposing: "you have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sella has now called its SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 per cent behind partner CDU (25) and just just in front of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the 2011 election, the SPD clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which begin at 5.30 a.m. and end only at 8 p.m., there are all praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "they have done everything pretty jagged," "" "says Elvira Tetzlaff of the jet fuel station." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be relocated to the south as scheduled at the start of the week until the end of October.</seg>
<seg id="8">The remuneration of the persons responsible for the construction work will also be commended, for example when it comes to the establishment of expeditions.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site immigrated to the south on Monday and the locking of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen has been lifted and therefore the connection to Rottenburg has again, the traffic situation within the village has eased.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofterdingen from the B 27 back on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The credential transport through the village seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some considerable complaints," says the deputy chief officer Florian King responsible for the management of the rehabilitation project.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstrasse, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping paths were looking for and more familiar with their navigation than the signposting.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were fringed in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the speed limits were also not met, the municipality called on Mössingen's measuring vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable transgressions," says King, who made himself aware of the situation himself.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have already been carved.</seg>
<seg id="18">The quickest was on the way at 77 km / h in the Tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has been moved on, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27, it is only a little consolation that for customers from Rottenburg now the street is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Businessmen don't like to look into the maps.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales collapses at them allows everyone to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "those who have less to do with the" "" "end customer" "", "i.e. for other companies, have little consequences for the refurbishment." ""</seg>

<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the places along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crowned, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential threat.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only did it, but all the restaurants were hit hard. "</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We need to be happy about every Euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "he figures sales revenues to" "" "far more than 50 percent" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "the road refurbishment took its operation" "" "back for two years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to dismiss half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, District President Jörg Schmidt on a request from Göhner said if there could be a financial compensation, with the hint answered, the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now, it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where such generosity has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all lawsuits, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been here since 1715, pointing to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">It can be understood that other regulars look less frequently due to complicated traffic guidance.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't approach it, it is also somewhere else beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubts that his regular clientele will return to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner holds the effects of the B 27 construction on its clientele for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, this is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="2">Despite diesel trains, delivery numbers are rising worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="3">But not all markets are running smoothly.</seg>

<seg id="5">Volkswagen is continuing to start deliveries in the second half of the year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Europe's largest car manufacturer can continue to boast a plus in the course of the year despite the diesel generation, thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, in July, the Volkswagen brand swelled mainly in Western Europe and thus again impacted the total sales, as announced by the company listed in the Dax.</seg>
<seg id="8">In July, the VW brand sold 449100 cars with 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year's month.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sales alone in Western Europe, China's second most important market, posted sales of 14 percent below the prior-year period.</seg>
<seg id="10">Deliveries declined by almost one sixth in the domestic market of Germany.</seg>

<seg id="14">In the USA, where the exhaust generation escalated first, a minus is also available.</seg>
<seg id="15">Great support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">Overall, the primarily affected home brand of Lower Saxony is further gliding through the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only an extradition of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group sales leader Fred Kappler continued to present a sales platform from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time, 5.904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests with a software.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW is calling some 2.5 million cars to be converted into the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of the retrofitting, VW affirmed that the conversion of the cars had no negative effects.</seg>

<seg id="32">With the wide term "warranty" Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example, customers can come to a workshop half a year after the conversion, and this could lead back to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even in the interests of the customer it is important to avoid that there is no uncertainty about possible warranty rules in case of any other damages which have nothing to do with the exhaust-scandal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle age love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before commenting on the comment section, to see him under the pseudonym of non-Alleenema-mediator-mediator age with harsh insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the recuperation of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but rather to Midlife-Nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no horror through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older members of the record store their emotions more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run amidst a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and grabbing wildly before I stopped, holding my hands and saying something better than: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho slowly gets lost in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent salesmen were resident - there is still a handful of fantastic platter specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera off for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, to whom I am from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (number of people: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I guess," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buy again items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things with which I was probably a little too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, working at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers whom he meets will apply to YouGov's profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pe, people who have heard about the comeback and set off buying back their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have led, people usually get rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of the record revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers accepted the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record covers, of objects that evoke happy adjustments.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so for many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to get involved spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "a team of staff leaks from a stack of records." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">An ICM survey in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At that time of the news report, I would probably look very worried as I crawl through a stack of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works in Sounds of the Universe (number of people: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone just came here recently and said," "" "I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead sound record so I can put them on the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musically.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I don't have a record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the vinyl records, has a blower audience than I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts neuters synthesizer and sexspacked pop instead of experimental jazz drys from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but the mental trauma is hard to find if you are standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around for several minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window-shopping as a wholesale purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, therefore collecting sheets is not a real option, it says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of slabs... "it drives off with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record enthusiasts: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I appear to muster the jeans pants, I watched a group of young girls who group for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody can see them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items meant more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research showed that the results of YouGov vote, they disregard, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors that exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not bobbling through the plate shops of Berwick Street and the sheets through sheets, while avoiding the staring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who raises nothing of middle-aged men over the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to submit 72 provisional deals in which people within the camp sell goods, cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which salvage a risk of fire and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also carried out that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 provisional shops, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">Judge Jean-François Molla said that food business, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than simply feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions. "</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the collapse was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is commonly operated and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in a letter to the Guardian it was said that" "" "the closure" "" "for these children would be a disaster of which the youngest eight years are old." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to focus on the next generation speed measurer: in various federal states, among others in Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash units are being tested, which are supposed to perform a particularly effective temperature position.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic real Enforcement trailers of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can, for example, be used at accident centres where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on highway construction sites or to rehabilitate bridges with temporary pace, there is often no infrastructure required to provide a stationary glitter for maintaining speed limits.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a permanent mobile setup can be too dangerous or complex.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement trailer is self-sufficient: the battery lasts five days with continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be recorded across multiple tracks at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits and access restrictions by time, road and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the manufacturer, it is possible to move the trailer in high-speed condition with each car with trailer hitch.</seg>
<seg id="10">So that it is not easily cluttered, it is lowered in the measurement mode, so that the wheels in the armoured and incidentally also sweat-resistant outer sleeve disappear.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the glitter from vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since 2015, the trailer has been tested in various federal states according to Vitronic and now also used.</seg>
<seg id="13">Foreign authorities also flash with the new technology: recently, France has ordered 100 copies, after an order of 150 pieces last year.</seg>

<seg id="1">United Kingdom Brings Silver in 7-Series Rugby after Fiji Masterclass Gold</seg>
<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-7 Rugby came to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis when they were struck here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodorus Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji issued a master class in handling, side-stepping, re-press, line run and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was swept through the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The obvious defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall to them in the finals.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji would have put a 15-man team in top form in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least a Briton will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow: Fijis chief trainer Ben Ryan, former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost every game at Adelaide Sevilla under Ryan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This cap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began to wonder and allowed GBs to bounce off.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were running in driving busses. the World Series winners went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau crossed in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With just four minutes playing time Jerry Tuwai made another attack from the right hand corner he walked around.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB has hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A voracious torchell of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Athjasa Veremalua had a touch down in the right corner and there was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa has added a new one since the restart and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou was driving through further weak tacklings of the UK team and rushed to the line to make a goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion took a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play 7 while GGB is still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">That's the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced basic changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt at GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went long in favor of the South Sea sultanans, whose fans sang, flags wave and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame resumed the finishing touch with another attempt in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fijis rang out, the fijis embraced and the GB swallowed crushing into the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated 20-5 in the semi-finals and the UK pressed South Africa in a short semi-finals match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a score among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the British 15-Aside team, secured winning - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emotless gold than in these games, and that's what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes to the last, 220 hard hind, which go down in history Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional importance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams was present when she came to the second Olympic champion in the second without a tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sports, who laid such a benchmark.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39.th improper deployment, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the style of the triumphal march.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the rowing is a battalion helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that make the difference, and no one was more helpful than the coach who did not know 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer this day.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that's what they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing on itself is already a challenge, but it makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve-riding morning something more than usual, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "panning, which was a centurion at the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan," "" "I was an emotional wreck this week. that might be something extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="24">Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have asked myself a better person to train or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning did not lose any races in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to stop, panning and globver had too much in reserve.</seg>

<seg id="8">Behind all this Rupert Göller, who was 31 years old in the Zweckverband, stands for 28 years as Managing Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water-purpose association of the Veirstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, annually supports approximately 150,000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 locations and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Members of the community are the municipalities of Kirchlouder, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">Water delivery contracts are available for further towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current president, Broadbrunner's Mayor of Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was employed as a water attendant in 1985 and was appointed managing director of the Zweckverband in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions, up to emergency interventions on weekends," "" "said the chairman." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event she named the inauguration and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), purchase of land in the area of the new well (1998) and compensation of the farmers, the redevelopment of the elevated tank (1999), the repurchase of a central computer control (2004) and the renewal of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There have been no downtime, and there have always been innovations again, because water means living and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudation she lauded Göllers loyal, reliable and correct service over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has established himself with a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he has lived the water-purpose association, as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veirstein Group on nitrate reduction prior to the water forum of the Lower Franconia district.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received a lot of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, on his part, praised water goalkeeper Alfons Griebel who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water carver and he was a faithful scarce.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As highlights from his point of view he described the construction of well and the restructuring of the association.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest challenge and the most difficult task, however, were the quarry at the high-level container at Kirchlouder on January 3.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">Even the supply of Neubrunn can only be maintained because the elevated tank of Pettstadt was filled with tubes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick für die Deutsche Stahmer</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-wracked and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared by additional costs in millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens, which are threatened by the branch of green electricity, are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains in the liberation from the renewables environment in the existing systems for so-called self-current production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "West German Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally reach that after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a fundamental agreement with the European Commission following discussions with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators in the steel works are replaced, an EEG levy of 20 percent applies.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this will not be collected in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed the agreement between Germany and the European Commission for the electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">So the status quo of the previous regulation is largely fixed.</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have a special significance.</seg>

<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation exacerbated further, when the world's largest producer of agricultural machinery threw massive steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers discard Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has eased somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, import duties imposed on import steel show effect, on the other hand the economic prospects in China have brightened up.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp cautiously remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, prices would have stagnated.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp did not want to close the closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the German steel industry, around 8,000 people were employed at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel manufacturers remain cautious.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Steel Association pointed out on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a brief upliftment in May, the quantity produced went back to each other for the second month.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent lower than the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in output.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp was accompanied by the singing of Ursel Kipp: as a young girl she was in the school choir, while she taught music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "sing moves me - emotional and bodily" "", "she describes." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she is doing something good in her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in the chorus and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because social and family structures often dissolve in old age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the elderly, seniors train a deep and controlled respiration.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand their lungs, do not get out of the puff as quickly in their daily life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">For elderly people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der senior citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people wakes up many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, self-dementia sufferers are sinking to long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">While singing, a particular performance is required to the head, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">Concentrate on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially elderly people who live alone do not only focus on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I do something for a long time, I will get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - for 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound comes next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of friends in a senior enchantor, you can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the internet can ask family, friends or neighbors for help with internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you want to sing, you should definitely join a choir, tell Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist revolt movement or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage that is limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">On the contrary, it is assumed that the bombs were put down by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">The authorities have received secret warnings on upcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days - but they were not informed of the exact date and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police ordered their officials across the country to increase security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand there are repeatedely smaller bombings, but they are mostly not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin there is a palace used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>

<seg id="31">Increased safety risk (Level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were made a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to cause chaos while the country is moving towards stability, improvement of economic situation and tourism.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fees per cubic meter of sewage are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welthahl, 3.44 instead of previously 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 Euro (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3,64 euros (previously 2,18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase once more if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After an overestimated calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the Kulmbach District Office, it was noted that submissions for these sewage systems were covered.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal bases, the market town of Kasendorf is obliged to operate the facilities in a cost-covering manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, the citizens and the industrial and industrial enterprises from Welthahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to access the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Head of Administration, Herbert Schmidt showed the body, a new calculation of the fees for the waste water systems of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and / or submissions from the previous calculation period are to be compensed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt founded the grave fee increases with the fact that all three wastewater facilities were relatively small, with a very small waste water treatment plant, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact on the basis of the low distribution base.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three systems is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, due to their age, renovation and repair expenses in all three systems have fallen to a considerable degree not least due to their age.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welthahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp for almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt referred to the fact that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the sewage plant Azendorf due to damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping station Welschahl, the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground, and after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage pond had to be disposed of, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation system had to be installed in order to comply with the water-legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Schmidt:" "" "the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period, came to these extraordinary expenses." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were considerably below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, Snapchat enables about 150 million everyday users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are uninflated, self-propelled tools generating more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All misunderstandings reach the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the past Snapchat filters have criticized criticism in which they were accused of promoting the app Blackface promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week passed a filter to some users who gave them slit eyes, false teeth and darkened cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellowish face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports of The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended to pay homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who experienced racism reminded the filter of hurtful clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others decidedly rejected the ananime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in an email Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos were widely spread, wrote that the filter was" "" "vulnerable and least unpleasant" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filtration effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish but that the yellow face was dragged into the descending extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling party.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats great audience of young people - who are more different in race than their older counterparts - could expect to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user, "it is much more difficult for such things to remain unnoticed when it was the case," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu decided, who works as a product manager and engineer for the medium to delete their Snapchat account, and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on medium and in a telephone interview she said that they believe that race-related controversies reflect lack of diversity in the attitudes practices of Snapchatting.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticised the largely white, only male leadership and finished their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff, so they can make such decisions," "" "said the Chinese-American Zhu," "" "or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left Snapchat unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, it refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently set up a personnel manager focusing on unrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu also said she will leave her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it's not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw an optimistic image of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions were allowed on the ground, an inquiry committee of the Congress announced in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Committee of Defense, Secret Service Committees and the Military Commitment Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence agencies who reported how superiors changed their assessments to U.S. efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>

<seg id="5">"intelligence gathering information, typically provided by high-ranking Centcom commanders, regularly called for a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it permitted actual conditions locally and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report.</seg>

<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed ongoing problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government officials under Obama have given instructions to change reports, it shows how analysts are exposed to the pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, comments and statements made before the Congress were much more positive than the facts." "" "the report noted." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, so much is clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman of Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command heads changed the intelligence reports to play the threat of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans were calling the Task Force to live after it was ascertained that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed insights while the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of Centcom reports are underway by the Secretary of Defense's General Inspectorate.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," "" "said the highest-rate Democrat in the Komatsar, member of Adam B. Schiff's House of Representatives, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, such Mr. Ship, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," denounced the moral among analysts and "gave excessive amount of room for deviating opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. ship and the democrats gave no clues to the intervention of the White House at the Centcom analysts in terms of a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by" "" "The Daily Beast." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon General Inspector who had been ingested after complaints from Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the reports of the Congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector were still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also stated that "experts sometimes have divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful aerial campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes of more than ten years ago, as a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the former government under George W. Bush looked forward against the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupying force in Iraq, and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker estimates that contrary to the government's statements, airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries had commissioned to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, reported the Times in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger Nachlshaber, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late as it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and inescapable of being a fast relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick that is calibrated by the wristband to float to the gymnast for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the conflict between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time with the Olympic Games and a swarm with dimples, could well have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time based on sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the olympic sailing gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, some in the shadow are the sports which are not generally accepted: aerial pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the swimming pool and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I would have enough arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although jumping on trampolines has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had made his debut in Sydney, the last 16 years saw that many who had asked me did not know that there is an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to competition, there has never been a medal in jumping on trampolines and until 2012 it has had an athlete who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outside charm, partly because it fits the unenlightened ear suitable for a clown school than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonical trembling of his never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports which are essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "Trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, meaning as much as" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging champions jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, fencing and saltos) before landing on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">You will be evaluated according to the official Olympic program according to the execution, difficulty level and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic Vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists in their quest for gold must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes up and down, upwards and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only chase the finish line or the original wall, but also another moverable goal in the broadcasters: the world or the Olympic-record.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented aspiration is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator into tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel fatiguing myself when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing space.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also around 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the end rounds as part of a post block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympic Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the angling and objectification of male athletes - as the male American gymnasts recently proposed to the Wall Street Journal recently - Mr. Dooley anticipates his new fan community.</seg>

<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that tens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police when switching to firearms.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopian just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more territories.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the response of the government was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed millions of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos about the protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Authorities requires a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the Project Manager of the Africa International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terror across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, and dissidents were forced to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile, or sent to prison, killed or driven into the deserts of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you don't suppress people and have no other options but protesting, it breaks out," "" "said Sejm Teshome, a teacher in central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in terms of power of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a far-sighted vote last year, the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time tensions rise along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been forced more or less in recent years, can take advantage of the turmoil and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of hinky under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">In recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media since cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave up that they gathered so to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons of eons the Amharas, who come from orthopaedics mainly Christian high-lands, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is changing just too.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are going to coordinate under one umbrella," "" "said Mulatu Gemusu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia illegally dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "the third reason for the unrest is Meles Zenawi's death." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Prime Minister of Ethiopia until his death for 17 years until his death in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemy Desalegn, was chosen for relatively intransparent grounds to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an upheaval was in 2005 after thousands of protesters protested against elections which, according to the statements of analysts, were apparently pledged by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed even though it was less than in the past months and this time of riots went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train and measurable advances in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But evidently this has not prevented the intensification of the internal grievance of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it accepts a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharan city, attacked by Tigray and hatred of the Tigray became increasingly common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over neighboring Somalia, even if she recently announced that she has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama was founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to scatter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by fearing that his multiple repeated claims, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification threw new questions on the communication capabilities of the Republicans' presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings its fellow workers who strive to take care of him during an eventful period, in the peculiar position to explain the statements which he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump made reference to the statement on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret, the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was contrary to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the allegation was completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted nothing of it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism falls down on Mr. Trump, while trying to direct the focus of his campaign for falling survey values to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton had speeches on the business situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech bored.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he criticised himself when he said that the Russians were to hack Mrs. Clinton's e-mails, but he later declared "Of course I meant sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic borders in politics and then to call back on demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary," clarify "depending on how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the sound for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has accepted an estimated tone since his surveys have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a leading edge in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his provocative pronouncements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misinterpreting his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is intensifying the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps jokes have placed his loyal partners in the uncomfortable situation of having to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent advocates, gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political commentaries," "" "said Mr. Giuliani for the correctness of Mr. Trumps's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them back-brokers, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Prior to the campaign events held in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of lying around on each of his words and being prejudiced against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he mocked the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts trying to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats apologize for Mr. Trumps as just another evidence that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a shabby café in Williamsburg, where you could pay only cash that didn't have a Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices came out of his Bedford Avenue shop front.</seg>
<seg id="4">The soap business Soap Cherie, which was sold in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Native inhabitants used it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I can still not believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel exempted and Verb is now a soap store."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is changing, then it's also re-invention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalized club cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing co-worker of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered him to provide money for a new outsider, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sauces.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice bowls.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no more beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "many old clients were also displaced by Williamsburg prices," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently, on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg in the past and visited the verb on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after pulling it to Greenpoint, she would take the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the club closed, she opened the coffee bar for a while, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "it became clear to me that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she drinks coffee again, even if she made a blended Chai Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been a long-standing and faithful customer since the start of the club in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went to work there and inevitably ordered the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "I came fourth, every day, like a Swiss fob watch and they prepare my Everything bagel with butter," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nowadays Rosenthal always gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said that he had no resentment over the fact that the soap business had taken the old premises.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owners of the soap Cherie offered a special soap for brewing with the cold-brewed coffee of coffee as an ingredient.</seg>

<seg id="20">Teams of women cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>

<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a festival of historic treats.</seg>

<seg id="41">As described in the book, the present of a housekeeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs Roosevelt said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comforting. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression, to deal with food, was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as how science was applied to food.</seg>

<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-hairy usually only come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This Hai was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation aboard the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-haie has only been born with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland shark swims along the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1,220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five-meter-long animal speeds up to a full of 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle, characterised by loneliness, seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the scientific journal" "" "Science" "" "at least by a Grönlandhai who could be 392 years old." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "insanity," "" "Alexander Scheuerlein, of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, comments this life span which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The evolutionary biologist said long that Greenland's hair is stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland harks are hard to observe, after all they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the Grönlandhaie's lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="17">They measured their slow motion when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">This sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They might chase sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice cream and look for cadavers coming from higher water layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland-haie, which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502 centimetre was measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed with the carbon-14 method the lenticular nucleus of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins they contain are no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably good carbon-14 in the lenticular nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear arming tests prevented large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third tier of 220 centimeters in length, the lenticular nucleus contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons attempt, it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In contrast, all larger Greenland harks in their lenticular nucleus had normal carbon-14 volumes generated by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed for a 493 cm long Greenland-shark an age of 335 years, while the record-Hai could even be 392 years old with 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönlandhai-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could allocate an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and his age was determined at 156 years, Greenland-haie with the increase is obviously at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such methane embodies live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the record holder, a 211-year old Greenland wale, in whose speck at the neck, stuck a 120-year-old harpoon-tip, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs into flame-flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are also often very big.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal is therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible," "" "explains the Darwinian" "" "Scheuerlein" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah," left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>
<seg id="4">During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel at the hotel's list of countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be invoked directly from the hotel room.</seg>
<seg id="6">How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the New Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?</seg>
<seg id="7">Wrote Lanzmann.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel from its own call center.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an explanation, the director looked at the hotel reception.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "the answer he received" "" "shocked him" "" "as Lanzmann wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "the hotel employee said that the measure was a" "" "deliberate decision by management of the Kempinski Hotel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The reason behind it triggered even more anger in the director.</seg>

<seg id="14">"" "the Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called it a" "" "big shame" "", "reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">We were horrified and troubled by this event.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is really very shameful.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that this has happened in this hotel chain in Germany is even a major disgrace.</seg>
<seg id="18">There is no need for explanation.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "we expect the hotel to" "" "draw the right conclusions" "", "said the minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The incident triggered a rather large resonance on the internet, in which people called the whole thing a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "some subordinated the Kempinski Hotel to" "" "indulge in the alleged requests of Arab guests." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "be ashamed," "" "said it in another post, in which it was pointed out that the hotel, which is located at the noble Kurfürstendamm, is located near a synagogue." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "the hotel quickly dismissed all allegations and called the incident an" "" "mistake" "" "and" "" "apologized" "" "to Lanzmann, The Mirror." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade sum between Moscow and Teheran grew by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, the interest in Russian companies on businesses in the country grew strongly, the ambassador said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Russian companies have established established ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to gain access to the market.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "of course, further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," "" "said Dzhagaryan." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">The registrants from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together four stages were dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time up to the next pilgrimage of all three registrants in two years, the Church of the Church of the Church of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were tested and one finally decided for the diocese of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered to the open portal of mercy on Freiburg Minster.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, and Haigerloch, and the rooms of the saints, rose up in the way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, Pastor invited the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim's cross and shared the pilgrim's blessing.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb we drove by train to the starting point of Villingen, where there was also a Muenster left beloved wife and so the pilgrim was taken from the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="9">Each day, the individual day-tours were accompanied by a brief impulse with various prayers, songs and texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis of field crosses, chapels or churches always made a stop to sing together a song made of specially made pilgrim songs.</seg>
<seg id="11">Parish heims of local parishes were available for the overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the stage goals Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller ensured a tasty and hearty dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we continued on Furtwangen in the direction of Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next day we took the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but in the case of high heat, some 500 metres of altitude had to be lowered and then again climbed.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the bathing lawn in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage in the impressive church of St. Peter, we went to the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Minis visibly relieved and happily arrived at the Freiburg Minster in the late afternoon and walked through the portal of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse God thanked God.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Minis by Kooperator Markus Obert were welcomed at the evening mass in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the Breisgau Metropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went back by train to Horb.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland Callum Skinner raced last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. the young boy made the legend haughty when he stormed home to take home a victory of the favorites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they brought in March at the Track World Championships in London despite Hoys only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man in which they remained as they saw potential in the Scots that has unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy win - and Skinner placed an Olympic circuit in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindu was just back after his lap, but Kenny made the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a great part of the transformation, in which execution drove in a higher gear so as to slow it down and enable Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell to Skinner, Kenny and Hindi when they climbed to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic board in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the Kenny and Hoys side, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he intentionally dropped on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement, and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "he said," "" "It feels like the whole UK flags on the tribune as London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We came together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have so badly gotten away with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven out of ten titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in the cycle stream.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the Form Trays it is in the realm of possibility that he repeats the victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - the exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (apparently holy date for British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same for Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doul qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the finish in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held on the second day of the competition in which Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he had agreed with representatives before the qualification when officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK Team relies on its strong team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Drama in the background took place in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and Mobbingvortexes as well as the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">But if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom it looks like the now legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator announces the contract of energy supply and thereby cancels all supply contracts, such as the supplying energy company.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step was followed by the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A 20-year subsidy will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa facility in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 workplaces - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk in closing.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could lead to domino effects, as the melt company consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa closed the point Henry Schmelzerei, which led last year to a closure of the Anglesea power station.</seg>
<seg id="9">The smelting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, supplying the large aluminium sleeve with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three more owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>

<seg id="2">Antonio Jenner, 20, Model and the fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Antonio, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York announced on Thursday the news on their Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," "" "wrote Antonio." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The revelation of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping Up with the Kardashian's similar?), filmed reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the all-popular show biz uncle and producer of keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as she ends with a classic turn: they all planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the cliché act of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in that publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has begun with certainty.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendal's big sister Kim likes her, as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West have been on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most sold issue of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that rather resembles an illustrated book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According to the 832 pages of the novel 615 pages advertisement).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover-star is expected so eagerly that in the last two years, images of the journal were still seeping before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "in recent years there have been more" "" "celebrities that mob" "" "as" "" "models, celebrities are" "" "on the cover." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous persons or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even though everything is true on Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who sign in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenn's success doesn't like everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV story, Jenners' position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called them "the Mistresses of the Moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings flashed up again when the news came out with the release of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But lying around on the mess seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Antonio Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your priming by Estee Lauder.</seg>

<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, therefore it wasn't good either.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was rather clumsy.</seg>

<seg id="12">"" "the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hannover as" "" "office in western pocket format" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for the standards at that time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator was to be reached.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers, albeit slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Quite proud the price was: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody was able to suspect in August 1996 that communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>

<seg id="2">For companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to circumvent ad blockage are equal to a "cat and mouse game."</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockings on its desktop, Adblock Plus released a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook shared that its desktop page would change the coding for its advertisements to make it difficult to detect which part of the page advertising is advertising.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of Hin-and-Her-battle between the antimating open source community and the bans has already been underway since the invention of indicator blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook comes soon with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "the fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying indication blockers have become the industry." ""</seg>

<seg id="11">Was a clash avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "this is something the prosecutor has to decide," "" "said Hofstetter." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not being held accountable.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs on the motorway in the middle of the night as it was called in the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year, a police officer was acquitted of the negligent killing after a man overtook and killed a man lying on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, took the court.</seg>
<seg id="17">The court stated that the policewoman, who had responded to an emergency call -- went on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely unusual and unpredictable situation," said the judge.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably inhabitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA have developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have detected erdlike conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lit up the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably stopped more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of the Venus displays its daily side of the sun for nearly two months," stated GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously thought by planet explorers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even though it was probably inhabitable, Venus -- over the course of billions of years --was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As her hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalogue of rotational rates below the stars of the star cluster of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars rotate in star-loops to different rates and in what context the rotational periods are associated with the formation of the planet.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star enhancements, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star cluster of the Pleiades is located 445 lightyears from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this cluster of stars, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are turning the fastest now.</seg>

<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping events.</seg>
<seg id="4">A learned athlete would almost have won a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping events in Rio de Janeiro are known.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chinese swimmers Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter Obsteteer Silvia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critically accepted athletics competitions these news are coming to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was detected last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Sports Court, CAS, confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old had finished fourth in the final over 100 m of butterfly, only about 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medals.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have attended more than 50 m of freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested the opening of the B-Trial and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very serious and demands full co-operation with the investigations," "" "said Xinhua:" "" "we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the verdict." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history no longer the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news about the positive sample at Danekova spooked by, the 33-year-old went on the offensive for himself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," said the Bulgarian TV channel BNT.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she was innocent," "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "said the athlete." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, the forbidden substance should be the blood doping agent EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the time being, Danekova was suspended, according to the BNT, the B-test should also have been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov immediately sent word to the athlete with criticism.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't understand why the athletes are not pulling the right conclusions," he said: "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have been excluded."</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weight lifters from the chronically doping polluting nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively like his brother Tomasz three days earlier on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both denied the intake, but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before starting the athletes, especially the case Danekova is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF world association banned the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic doping, and also the Läufernation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In swimming sport, in addition, the earlier settlements in China caused serious confrontations among athletes as well.</seg>
<seg id="27">Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Yang Harsch.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt lila."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "if I see the podium above 200 m Freestyle, I want to commit myself," "" "said Lacourt on the French radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also the focal point of a discussion with Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping fraud," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun was positive for the stimulant Trimetazide in 2014 in the Chinese Championships, but only had to sit down for a three month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data claw: so perfide blackmail hackers her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware anti-defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed over the past twelve months were at least once, sometimes victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware solution.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators to reuse the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attack company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially high-pressure release money is significantly higher than for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes Head Marcin Kleczynski talking to the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the malware programs were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">First, private users were the target, but the changeover to company attacks was terrifying fast in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files such as Word-, Excel or database files and archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and erase the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the end turn code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users find the personal photo database at stake, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">The damage is correspondingly higher if a ransomware fails.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of affected German companies reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent had to completely interrupt the business operation, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">Several hospitals in Germany have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always tell the victims: don't pay, you only support the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "for managers, it is difficult to reject the perpetrators" "" "demands" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know that and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure tested the user interfaces and contact with blackmail extractors and came to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their casualties by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, set free accessible support sites or decrypt free sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals are redeemed after payment of a few hundred euros, businesses have to negotiate heavily and pay five-digit amounts in order to recover their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more and more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware roughly within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software building kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The malware test created earlier by purchasing the malware itself, providing advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then searches for further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the boards on the ground, buys the set from a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals employ spammers with dissemination," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the terabytes survey rely on them to be able to repel ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption is no longer a threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes Head Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Depending on the type of data, the potential for damage is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even in the future, the perpetrators could completely take on new targets in the internet of things on the grain.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the con conference of Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could certainly be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators, instead of heating in the future, block an entire production line in a factory, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="3">In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear, it does not work closely at any place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the top of the cockpit is slightly different.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magical when it sounds: the seats of the rear bench can be folded up like kinosols and thus offer storage space that is 1.24 metres high from the floor to ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The luggage compartment can be loaded well, however, the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he should do his job a bit quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">A four-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steering should be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top" "" "Executive" "" "variant." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The safety systems include the City emergency braking assistant (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warning sometimes irritates, because when maneuvering, he assesses many obstacles as "approaching objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the smart temporter responds to traffic sign recognition and throttles if necessary the speed.</seg>
<seg id="23">But full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI jack are under the armrest and are therefore slightly cumbersome.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel is fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol station from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Better traffic flow on the motorway bridge</seg>
<seg id="2">It stalls regularly on the bypass road - here a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this should change: the legal regulation should be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all car enthusiasts who are in traffic on the ambient road every evening in traffic jams when they drive over the highway to Zubringer (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">On the next Tuesday and Wednesday (16th / 17th of August), the road construction will be extended by 700 metres to the right lane in the area between the Hammer road and the Weseler Straße exit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drivers can then turn right from the hammer road on the right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The big advantage: the traffic is divided in the early days, thereby improving the total running time on the busy section of the federal road 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of the Muenster-West district.</seg>
<seg id="9">The road narrowing on the feeder makes the driver nervous especially between 17 and 19 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="10">On weekdays, the return traffic goes up to the bridge across the Albero way and sometimes beyond.</seg>
<seg id="11">Reason is the needle-eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Weser Straße.</seg>
<seg id="12">From here, the traffic is driven only one lane by way over the motorway bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second track had to be built back well three-quarter years ago.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips against sleep disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, one rolls around eternally, at night one is awake for hours, in the morning it is not enough to think of sleep even far before the alarm-ring.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's all but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep problems manifest themselves?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes behind them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weemer, member of the Executive Board of the German Society for sleep and sleep medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands for the time being, however, is the insomnia, i.e. a single and sleepless disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Even diarrhoea can perceive many people as unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German Domestic Medical Association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind them can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medication.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently, sleep disturbance is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early waking is common in case of depression," "" "said Weekshot." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are mutually dependent.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who, for example, have a herniated disc, can be bad, wakes up every two or three hours and starts to salve about everyday problems and worries, fire gives an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I become a doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor, advises runners.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is worn off, tired, not slept, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or bodily problems such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to relieve the sleep disturbance, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">Dr. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Centre at the Charité University Hospital, Berlin, has hardly been laid down in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why you should first contact the family doctor if you have problems with sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep lab, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, doctors advise doctors in the sleep lab, for example, in snoring with shortcomings, in cases of abnormal fatigue, in case of sleepwalkers, or if you do not find the cause of a breakdown disturbance, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare yourself for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please don't take a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After clinging you go to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose goggles, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera sits on the ceiling to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Fire is important: regular sleep and stopping times, don't lie too long in bed, don't sleep on the day, don't watch TV to sleep, avoid alcohol and don't look at the clock at night - then you start immediately, and that's not conducive to it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few linden trees, in between still a remainder of cobblestones: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem so at first glance, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">When one walks along the road from east to west, one passes playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a biolade.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly" "" "has sprayed on the façade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite of a Lidl, which is soon to be demolished, it is already built: until 2017 a house with large windows and 133 new flats is to be built here.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy district" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will, however, be preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin inner senator Henkel has argued for a hard action by the police against the project, the area known as a "no-go-zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the Cadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers, the police patrol three weeks official statements with 30 to 40 officers and three team cars on the ground, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">On behalf of the unknown homeowners, the building workers were renovating the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later the police and construction workers moved under the cheering of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the road seems peaceful: parents go for walks with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking about late late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house there are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left-hand violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the neighborhood since 1999, and Jana *, who is raising three children here, are especially annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern for rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, which mostly wanted police protection from the vandalism on the left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin inner senator and the police open between house occupants and their neighbors, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers "district, which, in comparison to the rest of the city, has a low average income and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße in the vicinity of the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was cleared in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and polliners from all over the world: residents of East Germany and former domestic servants now share their neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they can be seen on inserted panes or freshly painted facades, which were thrown by colour exploiters.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year together with the words "left-autonomic violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours to consider this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: crimes like physical violation tend to be directed almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest part of the criminal offenses cause damage, which tend to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who for 17 years lives in a rented house next to the disputed 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is weightlifting: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are definitely not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect, her street is not a criminal point of burning, on the contrary: "here, one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more apart from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and remains.</seg>
<seg id="31">That's why it was so important to her that residents get back their streets: from police, politics and the media, who suddenly took up the interpretation sovereignty over the city in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neugebauer the street will continue to be taken away from them: through faceless newbuildings in former buildings that are displacing the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "in the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many people here - people who are not so well contaminated," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I can absolutely not approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should we do if someone never listens to it?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are drawn by colour bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who pull up should be aware of this - just like someone who pulls into a pub area that can complain about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented with first names have asked to not be called with their correct name.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is the new Commissioner for Refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner for integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the Commissioner for Refugees for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social educator supports the team of management for Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working groups refugee assistance, administration, authorities, and who else intervenes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is there, the ice-loving wool melee, which is above all a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">For instance, some - less ridiculed than rather on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, just a cutting-off woollen milky.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administration work is not her central area, writes Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has limited a 50-percent position over three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "said Regine customer that Annika Deuschle supports both honest and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for connecting refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must place the refugees in their own or rented quarters.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these lodgings must be borne by the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Local Government's Office to the Commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Until now, it doesn't work, it depends on private dwellings such as Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore common apartments have to be intimidated as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">New containers will soon be placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be explored or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "more places would be good," "" "reports Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help housekeepers, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no occupational therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it needs offerings such as sport, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So there are administration and volunteers here as well.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "they must explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example by language courses." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever develops the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach can't work and be useless, he will never integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are problem cases too, "says customer honestly," people in whom nothing goes. "the work of Deuschle and customer is always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: are they afraid of radicalisation after the latest occurrences, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine's client quite clearly," "" "what some may call naïve" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They are afraid that the assassins will bring them completely into retrieval.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "said Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So managers and volunteers must look for jobs on site and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants would soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Do Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">The policy is afraid to answer this question clearly.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on site helpers.</seg>
<seg id="60">"we haven't arrived in Urbach where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbachs are already at full capacity to integrate the old people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
