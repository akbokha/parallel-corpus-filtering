Obama Rec@@ ei@@ ves Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as the destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meeting should also deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critici@@ zes Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement building and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
through the deal promoted by Obama for Iran &apos;s nuclear program , the relationship between the two has continued to deteri@@ or@@ ate .
in March , at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech in front of the US Congress which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had been rejected with reference to the upcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor decides to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told a somewhat insi@@ di@@ ous voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead wife could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ p@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note , scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to und@@ o it , I loved A@@ my and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed from Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb had made the disa@@ strous distress call afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and collabor@@ ators knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his classes .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or criminal background .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both were taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time , there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had some health problem .
this year he only taught two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic way to employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after escap@@ ing from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs trail when he went back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ ane Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he believed that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb opened his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught Ge@@ ography and Ped@@ ago@@ gic .
he received his doctorate in pedago@@ gy in the spring .
one of the long @-@ time friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar .
at that time he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls mol@@ ted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , 40 now living in the Jackson &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subur@@ b of Brand@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no document of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and blues played .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail arrived three years ago on a summer fair .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for different companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss night last night 5 September for the last time Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ic@@ as@@ pi@@ el before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were sitting and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first @-@ semester seminar program and specialized on American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening , some 900 people participated in the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commemor@@ ative ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gi@@ l vi@@ gi@@ l , singing &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police are now saying that Lamb did the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb named Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
Toys R Us plans to hire less workers for the Christmas season
Toys R Us say that there won &apos;t be so many Christmas season employees like last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said it plans to stop 40,000 people in stores and sales centres throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that this month it will start with job interviews and the number of employees will rise from October to December .
while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is getting closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip with employees who sell , send and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox joke about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Ro@@ y@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated y@@ awn and an arm &apos;s length from being with the Princess of Wales at a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ str@@ it@@ ably the biggest travel film ever made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary @-@ General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the conflict lasting almost five years , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UN chief again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of the Council of Ministers of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys , it has ( yet ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask themselves what it means for the chances of nom@@ in@@ ating the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course it &apos;s still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at that time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ rin &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now recogni@@ zing Tr@@ um@@ ps staying power and starting to drop their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current surveys that suggest that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two out of ten Republi@@ cans saw the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers are held in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P voters were happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; vs. 40 percent speaking the same about pumping ) .
the next thing in the matter of excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Republi@@ cans do not see Tr@@ um@@ ps tem@@ per as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Republi@@ cans believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per for a president , as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a supreme commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six out of 10 Independent states that his tem@@ per does not fit into the White House , as ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their schol@@ ar hats , Republi@@ can vot@@ er Tr@@ ump hold for real .
if asked , who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of the ten end of July put their money to J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans were thinking that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination only 28 % for the final Candi@@ date Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a large number of GO@@ P voters have seen Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the re@@ public@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership while the anti @-@ dump@@ ing support is spread to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is harvesting the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a recent survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say that they have firmly denied their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they are in agreement with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump called &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , the immigration and fishing point of the public discourse was in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic mode of expression of Tr@@ ump will keep decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey on Monday , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they are in agreement with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do too .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son meanwhile accounts for about half the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also mad at Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines &apos;s Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 percent fer@@ o@@ cious . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg you find the most expensive residence - overlooking the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of a flat roof will cost 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study - so the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular layers one square meter cost the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , the price is as much as Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro nix - per square meter .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bayern @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double door scor@@ er in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller made the way for the FC Bayern to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympia ak@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have embark@@ ed on a dream start into the Milan Mission in the Wit@@ ches vessel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of coaches P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and i@@ dol hits ( 8@@ 9th ) deserved with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth consecutive success in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola will finally come to Munich in the third race .
in his 28th hit in the Champions League to the Bayern leadership Müller , Müller was rewarded with the help of Olympic champion Roberto , who had a well @-@ thought @-@ out shot of the world champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m had promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed notion , without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus has won his latest six home games in the premi@@ er league , including famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund was also proud ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bayern , un@@ defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they ran cour@@ age@@ ously , but often too in@@ ventive in their aggressive efforts .
the attacks were induced too often by the shift of the game to Left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , who rarely passed through O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i from the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k was hit from the right half @-@ field in the upper left corner of the gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half one .
first of all , when the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms of Ide@@ a Brown beat the Pole of the Pole by the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct closing , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians moved their usual dominant game , Pir@@ äus was able to set a needle @-@ stick .
but at Tor@@ hü@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er was reli@@ ance .
for example , when he ran a shot of ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6. ) .
before New , Guardi@@ ola made a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center near Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng defending it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , back in the cad@@ re after muscular problems , sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the martial arts hero only gave the green light after finishing the final session , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Uwe Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who wants to make something different is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ 2 ) .
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later .
there was a crash in the stadium in front of the game .
after a smaller group of partly ver@@ m@@ bled Bavaria fans in their audience block apparently provoked the supporters of the hosts Pir@@ äus , with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with bat@@ ons against the Munich tra@@ ilers .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term study of Potsdam .
the good news : at ren@@ unciation the risk decreases quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is the result of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several staff of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk in a short time but write the researchers in the Journal of Dental Research .
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks again to the level of qu@@ itting smoking , Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Dietrich explained from the English University of Birmingham .
one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , head of study H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot;
smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health up to high age .
in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by tooth@@ lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early loss of teeth .
the new long @-@ term study substanti@@ ates the findings .
archae@@ ologists encounter rem@@ n@@ ants of late Anti@@ quity in Cologne ri@@ verb@@ anks
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
in the vicinity of the building site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have dug up skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are searching for so @-@ called soil monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as a department for archaeological soil conservation .
in the third phase of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists were now looking for something .
from text documents , it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , Trier explained .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves that probably belonged to the church .

European Commission proposes new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to den@@ ounce the dispute over the proposed Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement TT@@ IP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function corresponds to significantly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens dare , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in charge of the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the US free trade talks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced its support .
TT@@ IP aims to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely suggest that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to come to equal parts from the EU , the United States and from third countries .
for the first time also a second instance is provided .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
until now , the proceedings involved agreed with each other on arbit@@ rators , there was no obj@@ ection to their jud@@ gements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in matters of fair@@ ness and justice , Malm@@ ström commented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she wants to work towards an international investment court according to her own specifications .
there could , for example , clarify disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , especially demanded by major corporations , are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe to TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , through which companies can ro@@ b compensation of tax@@ pay@@ ers , take national laws or impose a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act described the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , however , described the plans as a major advance .
the Commission included key points for the reform that Federal Economics Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel developed in spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the opportunities of the economy by too many new rules .
this could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , especially small and medium @-@ sized companies .
when the talks on the TT@@ IP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is deemed to be no more durable .
delicate Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , which the in@@ timi@@ dated folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is nearly seized by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells the story of various places he repeatedly records on the map , describing his meticul@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they originated and what it looks like there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderfully creative person .
with the 2003 and third album Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State , clever@@ ly composed songs seem to be very close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great opul@@ ent drift .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the rum@@ our of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 US states should follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and positively breaks certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live guitar and ban@@ jo are enough for him .
a year later , the New York musician returns to the series .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) appears in 2005 a widely acclaimed masterpiece .
bri@@ mming with ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no year list of influential music media .
after very productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of Ad@@ ore &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic sub@@ stitutes .
this sixth proper studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b .
long since the smaller clubs got off , the stage shows are here for a colourful spectacle made of ne@@ on head@@ bands and a large fluorescent stage decoration .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .
in the dark Hamburger More !
he is mainly presenting the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; available since March .
although nearly 2000 guests are now ban@@ ished in their chairs , the clearly more mature st@@ ev@@ ens return to in@@ timacy and to folk .
without judging a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the audience list@@ ens : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can basically throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record in essence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens mo@@ dest@@ ly thanks to an en@@ core , plays acoustic few older songs and finally dec@@ lines with thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ is@@ her
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut is eag@@ erly awa@@ ited at the prime minister &apos;s Fra@@ is@@ her .
the new Labour leader , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , is said to have made his debut at the prime minister &apos;s Fra@@ is@@ her and set himself for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to provide the first of his six pre @-@ set questions shortly after noon , with his performance being examined by the media and Labour MEPs from close proximity .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary sc@@ rut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , during a commem@@ oration ceremony on the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration ceremony on the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokes@@ man said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
nearly a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they were referring to differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported him as a leader .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are st@@ acking even within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statement on the position of the European Union and the limitation in profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes should be made to remove the whole idea of limiting overall .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow worker and retired minister said that the party was &quot; very clear , &quot; that it was only against government plans limiting the limitation of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory boss since , over the last decade , over the Dis@@ patch box in parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader , who has promised another policy approach , says that he has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crowd sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will refra@@ in from both &quot; striking &quot; and stri@@ pping with bar@@ bs and instead has undertaken to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic ministers , will be represented if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he has also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues may occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy show , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s questions . but a few years later he admitted he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the prime minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling part of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require extensive reforms .

pound Incre@@ ases by Acc@@ eler@@ ated W@@ age Growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose ab@@ rup@@ tly according to data , which indicate an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the target goal of SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and provides evaluations about the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed by 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a jump of 20 % after acquiring the rival company AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the world &apos;s two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher after encouraging news from the competition Group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said that it took 2.5 billion $ by a stock sale as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had put his appreciation for the firm rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports steering company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten expansion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill states that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs .
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber in the Capital : on Ben@@ ding @-@ Expedition in Berlin
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar .
21 years young , a hanging with a fat@@ eful F@@ rise .
the type with the plat@@ inum @-@ bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros difficult .
more likely even more .
currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 is spinning .
like Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
including E@@ wa and Victoria from Poland .
however , since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone s@@ labs in front of Berlin &apos;s luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the Bie@@ ber @-@ Bau : here you live I@@ dol , whose posters hang in st@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening .
the suite in which the Canadian singer is living costs just as much as her mom@@ my E@@ wa deserves in half a year .
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the tenth grade in the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fulfill her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compulsory scho@@ oling ?
who is it@@ ching ?
the fans do not .
even Bie@@ ber himself does not .
it has already taken care of .
for the advertising in the advertising break of the Super@@ cup he scored three million dollars , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ple company donated many , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber account .
and every doll , which looks like him and goes over the counter , also collects bending .
if Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , you will be amazed at the window pane .
it is to have captured more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e g@@ inge too far .
others emphasize , Bie@@ ber is finally in the US and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; to number 1 .
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA @-@ Poster brings Lebanese to potato woo@@ fers idea
potatoes or twe@@ et@@ ers ?
both - and indeed in the m@@ ashed tone that Ol@@ den@@ burger &apos;s owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay has put potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea brought him a poster with a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he had seen on television .
since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer served in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is multic@@ ultural for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea came to the Lebanese patent office in Munich meanwhile .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as utility model .
therefore , Al@@ hay is not willing to betra@@ y how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the international understanding of nations is also good for his customers .
met@@ rics starts fund@@ raising campaign for the fight against al@@ di@@ - invasion
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash launched a ground research campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di is preparing the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and expand the brand I@@ GA by mainstream marketing and marketing via the social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ immo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and store owners who sell cheaper tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will disclose further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment will carry out its annual investment strategy day .
there is much on the game as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shops and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison to about 14 percent in the eastern states .
but analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take about five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this predic@@ tion is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year , and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ a loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most faithful .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager , Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , reported on a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash is likely to disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ alli@@ c contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ G@@ AS &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler continues to invest more than $ 150 million to match selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by increasing fresh produce and providing a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s CEO Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging rehabilitation programs to El@@ an are expected to grow and hopes that the wholes@@ al@@ ers will return for the first time in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios , and , according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly , deserves praise for his own behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is again referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight during the not@@ orious exchange of Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbit@@ er , where Har@@ rison shou@@ ted : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp mis@@ led a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the individual behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I am rather en@@ vious about is the fact that , according to my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was a bit dra@@ gged into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost because of a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he &apos;s not the first player to break a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much appreciation .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strictly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained , he &apos;s good in form , he &apos;s a very stable and mat@@ ured young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision not to consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ ano &apos;s decision on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Nick made the climb very quickly , what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he goes up in the eyes of the public and he deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I consider appropriate , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency stand , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the state of emergency and den@@ ounced the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants accum@@ ulate in a man &apos;s land and re@@ acted Ser@@ b officials with indignation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the lands and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter was ho@@ vering over them , the migrants shou@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried alleg@@ ations against the Hungarian polic@@ ing police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister explained it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary were sent back while more and more arriving from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border ended one day after the 28 @-@ nation block at a controversial meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that , finally , the next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would be made that the EU states would record another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit from the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary didn &apos;t put his hopes on a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or from his neighbors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block streets and speed up asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after having completed a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even jail @-@ mates were employed in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the coming economic refugees are seeking a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into force around midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also establish higher sentences for convic@@ ted human traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government states the emergency situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still agree on the military use of the military expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence ; they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are going to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders was arrived .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process people &apos;s data and press a crowd to push there .
about 20 succeeded in coming in , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to keep a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her against the ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents in primary elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( 17 percent increase ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidate for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion determines what candidates will support them .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders achieved some gains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton has a great advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their support among men is significantly reduced , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage over 50 years of democratic voters has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton has a great advantage over the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin at the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a five @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries nationwide say that they would enthusias@@ tically support Clinton when nominated by the party .
a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about it .
the views are more bl@@ ended to those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support them .
while 48 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their peak candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it is time that a woman is President ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s involvement with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned by Clinton &apos;s supporters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agreement on how to deal with the problems and the voters will also be cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the vice president raises a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
of Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den &apos;s second choice would be far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage ahead of S@@ anders increases from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fifty percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure has fallen by 78 percent last month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; bi@@ ds are by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eligible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democ@@ rat voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like last month none of the demo@@ cra@@ cies or potential candidate for these elec@@ tors have emerged as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates perform good results in some important tra@@ its with voters of the prim@@ aries of their party .
there are maj@@ orities in Clinton , S@@ anders , and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best cut in hon@@ esty with the three candidates , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic elec@@ tors have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server remain as Foreign Minister during the term of office , most Democratic constitu@@ ents of the elections are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions overall .
but it is another story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion has deteri@@ or@@ ated .
they are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 who say their views have become worse from Clinton .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 % of those entitled to vote do not hold them for honest and trust@@ worthy person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote nationwide also see Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , get good notes under guidance .
out of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut best with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 demo@@ cra@@ cies in the elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves to nationwide survey close to Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son resi@@ des close to Donald Tr@@ ump at the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
in the meantime , half of the support of voters in the new pol@@ l is eliminated and others lose a dramatic stance .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . the support is growing by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , by 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
but Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and has sur@@ passed Tr@@ ump under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Govern@@ ors John Ka@@ sich , is defeated by Scott Walker &apos;s Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell in the deepest place , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are on third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son is rising in surveys - with 19 % support in the Republi@@ cans , behind Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump well ahead of Car@@ son .
with a view to a Car@@ son ascending last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed for making Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s belief in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find warm water .
a bath in the North Sea or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people are no longer in the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , divi@@ des the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
bath @-@ temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic Sea there are 25 degrees in the top , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood loaded with the death of a Bar@@ uch college newcom@@ er
nearly two years after a student died during a casual ritu@@ alization of a student association in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , M@@ ord@@ anch@@ ors are filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , told the police .
officials said he had been loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained of head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the 911 call number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and supposedly waiting for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police officer Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and ordered the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after a aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly joined with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so , and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies in the ch@@ ic@@ ane since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ &apos;s family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe had recommended an indictment for the assass@@ ination of the third count for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with alleged attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rise in interest will come , and the house will collapse , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only small instructions for the process .
a recession came in just 11 months after the first rate of interest rate and lasted for 86 months .
the Federal Reserve &apos;s aggres@@ si@@ veness in raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , representatives of the US central bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period needed for norm@@ alization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that the whole excitement could possibly be exagger@@ ated due to interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no effects .
here is a historical trend based view of how some sectors of the economy might react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that asset income stems from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market has been in the upward trend in the past 35 years - roughly 14 percent - on the road to interest increase , fairly flat in the 250 days after ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , chief urban@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on stocks tend to occur later in the boom cycle and the return on investment begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously failed and could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , only twice the nominal GDP decreased by 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , few expect this to continue and forecast for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta F@@ ed , only 1.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants made a net interest rate of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes focused on the session of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week ending Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading only gives a 25 percent probability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all growth cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ essions are put in the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest maintained by the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le as the market anticip@@ ates interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is quicker than in shares when they change their strategic course .
in bonds , the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first raise / lowering occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the raising cycle , the introduc@@ tions immediately fall , the Deutsche Bank said .
Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b &apos;s strate@@ gi@@ sts believe that the rise in interest rates will cause returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher returns , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is interesting , according to Jones , that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending has increased and volati@@ lity has risen - all the features of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that cover the larger part of their operations in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multination@@ als with high debts will be worse , as an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market as well as financing their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s @-@ analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded average 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity in their shares also sur@@ passed their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a major problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside the pure share capital , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits through higher returns , even if experts from different opinions are how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Member of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; conserv@@ atives member of Parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cur@@ v@@ ature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; converts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the station to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public broad@@ ca@@ ster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ enced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distinguish from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under another name .
so , if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples in which you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC director general rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and public education .
what I learn from Radio 3 I won &apos;t learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works , I really consider it important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey ar@@ gues that harder it must be worked to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the Sel@@ ection of Culture , Media and Sports came under fire to tread the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC musical talent show bought by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was &quot; produced in a special BBC fashion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when the next time there was a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from further ranks of The Voice in the future , or to spend money of the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
net sales slow@@ ed down in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the record in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones
experts believe that Black Friday slow@@ ed spending in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping boom has bo@@ omed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there is evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only show seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth dimin@@ ishes .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing sales .
experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases from this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers gathered around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers are fighting for bar@@ gains , could keep shop@@ pers from doing shopping .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 was sold more than £ 1 online .
in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now being carried out via web shops .
at the same time more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online rather than in the fashion stores in the inner cities .
Muslims bury the injured in Mec@@ ca during the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first fun@@ er@@ als in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia sets off the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane pl@@ ung@@ ed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the dead that were killed when a crane collap@@ sed to Mec@@ ca &apos;s mega mos@@ que .
ber@@ eav@@ ed , dressed mostly in white , the route to pay their respect when the first of the dead comp@@ eted their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the procession went past the sacred site , where only days before a building crane passed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the beds .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king talked about the construction company of Bin Laden &apos;s family because of the disaster that also left 3@@ 94 injured .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 inhabitants who were killed when a crane pl@@ ung@@ ed through the Great Central mos@@ que of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the yearly p@@ addle in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already firmly promised that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group should not have stopped the arm of the crane when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company was forbidden to travel abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man v@@ owed to reveal what caused the overthrow of the crane , which rus@@ hed into a courtyard of the great mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later takes place this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not publish any statements about the Coll@@ ap@@ se de Kran@@ s , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also included the group because of not current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s great mos@@ que as part of the massive building managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased al Qaeda leader , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a apost@@ ate son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the wre@@ ck of the crane came amid heavy winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
government officials stated that 1 Million Re@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other wounded will receive half of this amount .

the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe sur@@ ged
this leads to 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops aimed at tra@@ des@@ people
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q sales points nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled Eastern European tra@@ des@@ men carrying out the work in their homes .
if you are skill@@ fully dealing with a hammer or brush for painting walls , you seem to belong to a minority nowadays .
because Brit@@ ons are increasingly employing professional tra@@ des@@ people to perform DIY jobs in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new CEO of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the building markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices is now out@@ dated .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open up to 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 points of sale of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wanted more women to be involved in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten buying decisions in the shop are made by women .
at the moment , the men predomin@@ ate .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households that perform more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must shift this to balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group ow@@ es costs to close the shops .
because of the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , who owns Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball player A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and rejection of responsibilities at the K@@ lagen@@ furt municipal court .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also charged with official abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted of this alleg@@ ation in force in May .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , during the preliminary examination , the def@@ end@@ ants used funds of association accounts in the years 2006 to 2011 , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes .
he damages the damage at around 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sports officials are also charged with financial mel@@ ts .
this fact was the head of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
for the dis@@ miss@@ al of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time was an asset in the association .
the sports officials only charged expenses and the sports club for which they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the Pas@@ si@@ va in 2001 amounted to approximately 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 44@@ ,000 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then we stood before the situation : do we carry on or lock the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ end@@ ants , in the bread @-@ office of large @-@ scale firms in the finance department . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his co @-@ worker and co @-@ accused , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have given money to secure our life insurance policies at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can freely admini@@ ster the money , it is not allowed to have debts .
in addition , in case of a corresponding financial success , the payout of the allow@@ ance payments was decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 .
therefore one has paid off part of the expense allow@@ ance only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus has been on the account .
therefore , l@@ ump sums and not detailed bookings seemed to explain , the former chairman explained the processes .
the accounts and econom@@ ists shared the two accused together , the second def@@ end@@ ant said .
the judge asked why the pay@@ outs had not been disclosed in detail to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in the financial position in detail , important is only the freedom of debt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when an official criminal investigation began in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the bank account .
that had been set@@ backs , the def@@ end@@ ants declared .
this securities account was based on the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and , according to the statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent knew no answer for a long time .
then he finally thought he believed that this was the best thing for the society .
if something happened to him , nobody would have known anything about that money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room .
the co @-@ accused had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cla@@ im Report &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why claim compensation ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
the first def@@ end@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation because the association was never damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he had never paid a cent salary , he only charged Kilomet@@ ers and di@@ ets .
he charged EUR 1,000 per month at di@@ ets , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not able to show exact documents for the early years .
these were no longer kept for an audit in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
the second def@@ end@@ ant had also obtained mil@@ eage .
all the movements are in cash , and he has to go to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence on the international market , he stated in his statement .
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard hosts another 30.000 jobs
in addition to staff reductions , which have been running for three years , further jobs will be added to the computer at spl@@ itting the company .
the positions of the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) system are no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group is planning the disman@@ tling of 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its corporate customer division .
as a result , costs of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special charge of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will be incurred from the fourth quarter .
the ongoing reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP had a workforce of roughly 30@@ 2,000 .
in the after@@ market , the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ share was 2.3 percent .
the company , which has grown up with printers from the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto , currently spl@@ its up : in this way , the computer and printer business is to be pool@@ ed in a new society - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business segments are to be listed on the stock exchange .
another dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand from corporate customers after its services ended the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
the revenues thus declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP rep@@ lies with a spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions on the change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man recently re@@ acted to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and get more and more business online .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plan envis@@ ages a total reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would , however , primarily meet rejection : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 per cent cons@@ ented .
61 percent of other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria .
24 per cent is opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
in cooperation with Syrian leaders Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of respon@@ dents decline , 20 percent would be .
29 percent could not decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th IAA
the focus of the fair is on September 27 connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electric mobility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility unites &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wide public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
the organis@@ ers of the V@@ DA car association reck@@ on like two years ago with about 900 000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police deployed at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and floo@@ d@@ lights against several hundred refugees .
your Kiev correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police there was a police line and a water @-@ thro@@ wer was standing behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles according to the officials .
the officers initially used mint spray .
after that the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ stood somewhat cau@@ ti@@ ously .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was dischar@@ ged from the zone .
children who inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world ob@@ serves when the US central bank is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether the interest has been raised for the first time in almost a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surv@@ eyed by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of the opinion , was that the F@@ ed will do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will continue to remain a little longer and keep the interest rates on the current level of 0 @-@ 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it is seven years since the F@@ ed interest was set to NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero range and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , senior employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is based on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global conditions .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs suggest that the odds against such a move are good .
the decision is to be announced at 8 PM CE@@ T on Thursday
death Protection at Delta State University left excuse to write
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleague and killed his colleague , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; during the first murder and wanted &quot; he could not make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has shot on someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency center that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
as police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 , which said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could und@@ o it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was told by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said that they were married about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online at home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. title from Delta State University in the spring of 2015 , as his life chart indicates the university &apos;s website .
stars that lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor was also alleged to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of ad@@ diction to drugs .
all this certainly demands its toll .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large Group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros per year alone with a better organization .
150 of the roughly 1000 executives around the world will cost the workplace for the restructuring of the Group .
there are , however , new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is to generate an earnings contribution of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue syn@@ ergi@@ es , shared the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will no longer have a board member responsible for the passenger business .
the cheap airline Euro@@ wings is to be developed as independently as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the management team headed by Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the company intends to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
until now , the organization of the 120@@ ,000 employee was highly complex .
the airlines operate under the umbrella of the airline group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict with the Pilot Uni@@ fication Cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations will be resum@@ ed after the court @-@ launched strike on Thursday .
this divided the union .
the topic of conversation should be the retirement age for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cockpit wants to come as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concept in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it seems that the Lufthansa hits the Group &apos;s own cheap line Euro@@ wings in the fight against competitors .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United does not play for months due to double frac@@ tures
in the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this made the left outer defender to cry and is excluded from playing for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w had fallen into the PS@@ V region .
he was treated for nine minutes in the field and needed oxygen before being brought to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said van Ga@@ al : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg of leg and is in hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
he had an oxygen mask in the dressing room .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be escaped from a red card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ metre .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet printed on Sha@@ ws account : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my path to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player with this type of injury leaves the place , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ ash Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron is better acquainted with The Lor@@ ax ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long until you know it almost by heart .
unless you &apos;re David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the prime minister chose The Lor@@ ax , the environmental label published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on Super@@ Camp@@ s website , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , as there seems always to be a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron re@@ port@@ edly describes the story of the book , returns instead a summary of the 2012 film version that added new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; amid the walled city of need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads one . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel , and who died in 1991 but completely unknown .
as if that would not be suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads partly as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ em @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here an un@@ named boy hears , as the local environment is devast@@ ated by the gre@@ edy , trees u@@ pping , thri@@ ving kn@@ itting On@@ ce @-@ ler , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per that The Lor@@ ax has not read about 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning Street Spe@@ aker said that the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s election circular office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
b@@ umping into Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ re that England chose for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude a forward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th reti@@ res from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to skip Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination because - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , one would have extended the barrel of ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
hopefully , if he kno@@ cks out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even if he did not produce such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question how much time a test drummer gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances , like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton received nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first used Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ says was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in and he &apos;s a drummer , whom I highly deposit .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw early in this season at Yor@@ k@@ shire when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as that before him , but this of course depends on the team order in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of letting mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would give an extra spin bow@@ ler and receive four squ@@ e@@ cks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s rope of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is he number 3 for her and there &apos;s no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred ra@@ ps straight away and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited use with him he has impressed me very much as a young man .
people may see his statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders that raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some clever additions to the coach .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor to the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white sphere stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights we can benefit from .
sometimes new voices can get fresh breeze in the locker room , even if the news is in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used by the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you need to remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made with a slight heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it bearing ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Britain out of the EU ) could gain access if the economy goes into a trap by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ interrupted ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will go deeper every day , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , viol@@ ently disper@@ sed because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at fre@@ aks recently that some member states are deeply involved in various crises , such as the EU is now and not always from their own guilt , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want to be sati@@ ated .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and finance ministers climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s all about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , wishing a great Britain outside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point in some capitals , no matter whether we remain or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened with the exagger@@ ated long endurance like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mitter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that they will get a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful comments , throughout the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process is suspected by my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing out of the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be on their costs and which EU scep@@ tic is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press arms , as they did during the 1975 referendum , inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ Opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade @-@ Ban@@ ana &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
in all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telep@@ hon@@ y foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals who own most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her but realized that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you get better ban@@ anas distributed to distra@@ ct him instead of his lunch and dinner .
in fact Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir himself than Bla@@ ir himself , resist@@ ing Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had put the principle on the EU &apos;s non @-@ adopted constitution , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly sla@@ p on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me to waste - seems in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil &apos;s boy@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe is - I express it kindly - in the development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ tom@@ off tendency and the wild follow @-@ up of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can everybody say yes .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on radio and television told this week when the boy sc@@ outs batt@@ led in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ y@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet col@@ t without going too far and losing his cabinet .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all the reports on the Monday evening .
whatever the pu@@ ffy bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and especially in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks this way .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege @-@ Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for whom the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin turn political capital , they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British , if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on the Monday of something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ funded Agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Story Report &quot; last month and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month picked up the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy basis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on demonstrating efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expected that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions about the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received from British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed BA@@ T &apos;s references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding it should have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International added .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include industry funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the P@@ he tobacco manager took part in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products with most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes served as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ Being at P@@ he , said that the claims of BM@@ J have already been re@@ acted previously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence is evidence and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people die annually in a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by clari@@ fying current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up on the East@@ side , says former head of Channel 4
the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ers and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for public @-@ law programmes , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broadcast , which would also clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee during his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t think of for a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least keep your production on programs that others do not make or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to reach the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax program is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ erin is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I have to see how this is supposed to be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC &apos;s debt on the hunt for reviews is &quot; because of the ambition of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts will be what the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart talk in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows should sell shows like East@@ enders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal ni@@ ches should go to BB@@ C4 where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their seem@@ ing missions to justify 4 billions of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which nobody ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee on the fee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you all think that you get a great value for £ 150 a year , but for people who are a lot of money for £ 150 , ask me if that &apos;s true because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Tuesday committee , called for the BBC to check its eth@@ ic mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , train and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of its TV production and 0,1 % on the radio - and it should take an example in the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada to &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of TV are shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers enter alli@@ ances to make everything online available .
&apos; Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled by frac@@ tures of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment when they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard .
the impulses are based on the switching on of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane duc@@ ts that respond to ultras@@ onic waves .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms presented the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetic , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ az@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the low brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to people &apos;s brain to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread@@ worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ az@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves trigger the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ az@@ ani modified the worms in such a way that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultrasound to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro ves@@ icles and transferred into the worms where they turn on the changed motors .
the method has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ az@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light which has to be sent down to the required position in the brain on an optical fiber , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ az@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are to be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and which require a second look .
&quot; important announcement : take the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( D@@ ock@@ lands Light Railway ) from 15 to 18 September . you can read the letters of the London Under@@ ground and the hall@@ marks of the DL@@ R line that turns into the image of a bul@@ let .
in September there will be a flock of tru@@ ckers with the DL@@ R ... Customers will be asked to help at the stop of the weapons fair .
the 300 posters are artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum of cruel designs in Bank@@ sys D@@ ism@@ aland .

one of the par@@ o@@ dy ads produced by Special Pat@@ rol Group .
according to Gav@@ in Gr@@ in@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will get more critical and try to bring political works to the public outside galleries .
many artists engage with activists within protest movements and realize that they have to go out into the real world so that their art has an impact on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters sal@@ utes commuters in the subway .
the Am@@ ne@@ sty video was viewed more than 100.000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , who works char@@ itable with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist who works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that reigned around the advertising for the weapons fair - through a legend of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they played with the invention of a more realistic che@@ ering company advertising , but &quot; through the blu@@ ep@@ r@@ int with bright colors and animation it remains to be mi@@ tig@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us shar@@ pen awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is an intervention by the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not illeg@@ ally tra@@ ded outside our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the trade fair comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L where exhibitors sh@@ out fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ful 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved into a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se s@@ miles of those I have anger@@ ed - and the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly cran@@ king up to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to chat : people tell you where you come from , whether and where you took sab@@ b@@ ati@@ cal year , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like unlike those with whom you would not speak even if your lashes were burning and those fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people leave .
people often turn into drinks reception , film night event locations and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract attention and their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start a relationship at university
intro@@ vert is given a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy that I have consumed with you for the interaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is fati@@ gu@@ ed - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of pos : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by B@@ aking .
since you start the university at the peak of back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck at the doors of people is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have baked something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad sm@@ elling lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to sleep when you drop .
to steal food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the milk owner .
chances are good that they say they serve themselves , even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , this is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my room@@ mate , adding a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to their milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that stops people from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbours whether something makes them mind , drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more lu@@ ke@@ able music .
when they stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she had pl@@ agu@@ ed her own music , shut her door and went to her three hour trial .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same residence hall ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you have a room@@ mate for your future spouse to go back to her , dis@@ connect and see her every day , and perhaps experience how she brings together all common friends ?
of course the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment when you notice someone has his key lying in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments when it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never forget someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
lock your door and place your keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but stap@@ le your keys on the ceiling not more than twice .
row houses for refugees , single mothers ,
the real estate manager Markus Gil@@ dner builds town@@ houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need residential space but also the single mother and the less ear@@ ners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people stay here for a great deal .
in view of the current refugee flow , we also need enough housing in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ story terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a terra@@ ced house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when people are accommod@@ ated in blocks of residence .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it can be that many refugees will say , it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the individual needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euros , without property .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
that is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have correctly dra@@ fted my project .
it is especially complicated by the im@@ min@@ ent Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the Ord@@ in@@ ance Ord@@ in@@ ance .

it is still under construction , who in a terra@@ ced house manages three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place missing .
and asylum seek@@ ers and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
which is definitely not true .
but do you not intensi@@ fy the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but it was built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , and ordinary people also need housing .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the hired servant .
I &apos;ll show you how to build still cheap and good today .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , typing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the rush goes back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has made this more prob@@ able by linking the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may turn off half way and this could lead to a breakdown of the update .

Ros@@ berg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton just another motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup second emphasized before the start into the crucial seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the vice world champion before the race in Singapore on this Sunday from defending champion and double champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the previous twelve races of the season and is also attacking the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
2009 and last year , the 30 year old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will have an influence on the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .
a ha@@ ze @-@ bell hangs over the city for days , triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sum@@ atra .

district office seeks direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened up a new contact point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides consultations you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , directly next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and advice receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or services of health care and nursing staff .
for years , with our out@@ patient care service , we have established that nursing relatives are often left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , many services of the insur@@ ers are not in@@ frequently used because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new manager J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Bürger@@ hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to do this , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore it is possible to use additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis ideally complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the retirement centre for care and care &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district offices in the city centre is seeing both business leaders in the demographic change .
this is because it is essential to make a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , as the mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the District Office also dedic@@ ates itself to the compatibility of the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able get @-@ together . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a major contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment .
the accommodation office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 and Saturdays from 10 : 00 to 12 : 00 .

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang passed away at the age of 92
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Viennese architecture , is dead .
he died already on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the artist &apos;s house announced on Tuesday .
with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus won an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as was said in the broadcast .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

men beating 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a sev@@ ent@@ een @-@ year old Afgh@@ an , followed the police of his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point , the group was at the level of the b@@ ft filling station .
there were also three persons on the gas station grounds .
one of these men then cried out to the young people and struck them with the fist .
the victim had a nas@@ al @-@ leg@@ gy vom@@ it and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
when his two friends rus@@ hed forward and appe@@ aled to the bat , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator pursued the group with a car to their home and demonstr@@ atively drove past several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured person went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male .
under the help of a stroke , one checked on the face and thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured person had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
up to now only a vag@@ ue project description is available .
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters tall .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police are asking for witnesses and advice to report on the phone number 06@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over office breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( left ) assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen .
also , joint may@@ ors Bernd Bor@@ mann , business promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing luck : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of rock breaks on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich will be in half a position to his successor in the coming months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic at first sight , when the field stand@@ ings met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently completed their medical training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and will also enter into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mill@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was time I just called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the married couple Müller liked the idea of pursuing their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the mill@@ ers bought the house with practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up there , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed to the senior physician in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged in an honorary capacity in the DRC @-@ readiness for Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from 19th September , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as house physicians .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 year old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the renovation the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a supplement of € 50@@ 000 will be given to the land@@ owners as part of a funding programme of the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that practice is continued &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l about 2000 patients come into practice in the field of rock breaks , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
there is another doctor &apos;s practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the Phar@@ m@@ acy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor was found , she would have gone .
who visits Müll@@ ers &apos; consultation hour , by the way , continues to look first of all in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the rock formation .
with their f@@ arewell in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the doctors have practiced for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; rec@@ alls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen , smiling .
after the long time , she already felt a little sorrow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are living further in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband re@@ plen@@ ished : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now I have always pressed against gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ sons and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees pass through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also driven up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Internal Affairs , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border are maintained parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear that anyone who wants to put a asylum application can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear also , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would leave arriving refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and also set up cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
however , the Minister of Internal Affairs , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenian does not want to reduce its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to leave in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in order to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police could pick them up in the near fields of ma@@ ize .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees are constantly being hit by the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days his country with about 4000 refugees reck@@ on , Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , press buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were re@@ directed to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade Government strongly denied that it was possible for people to adopt certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the morning , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the road all night long , about 500 kilometres away from Macedonia &apos;s Mac@@ ed@@ onian fron@@ tier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has made it , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
as a result , the postpon@@ ement of the former Balkan Route of Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary could indeed come to a somewhat further west route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 . since then , the EU partners have consistently made a good testimony to the country as regards the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees are now going to go to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic still tried to calm down Wednesday at a local eye in Hor@@ gos . he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border has now been closed .
it would not currently be a very high number of refugees .
one cannot say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee aid workers have already started distributing maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , there are still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals , accused of having gained insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
with the captured information , in@@ sider trading on the financial markets should have been made .
in this way , according to the investig@@ ators , a total of over $ 100 million was launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SE@@ C announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 other def@@ end@@ ants in the case continued .
most of the def@@ end@@ ants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators are expected to have acted both in the USA and Eastern Europe .

puls@@ ating , pr@@ y life with beautiful autumn sunlight and in the midst of it four big boards each with the head@@ line &quot; Before I die ... &quot; ....
with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ Aid rose to its 20th anniversary and was confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went into the city and among men with the action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Foundation is available to the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by as well as for questions and talks like the volunteers .
while some p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by spontaneously interven@@ es in chal@@ k and compl@@ ements the sentence around &quot; my life affir@@ ms , &quot; &quot; Stop the war &quot; or &quot; don &apos;t suffer long , &quot; others stay short , read , say phrases like &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet , &quot; and then go on .
again and again there are small discussions about the action on themselves , about life , dealing with the dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that some@@ time the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Mannheim plant in Mannheim together with the Car@@ itas Federation bearer of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
it is understandable that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards , but be understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the issue of death and death is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years contributed much to the opening of the people .
an assessment that An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid shares .
the death and mourning atten@@ dant is one of the first @-@ hour volunteers .
faced with personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ Aid was looking for volunteers by the call of volunteers , she immediately reported it and had been part of the founding in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 wives and two men - those affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce of Saint Vincent .
all are carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can deal well with her job and the experiences and experiences made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another place , keep it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ atory ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hip is free of charge and con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations allows training as well as training and supervision of the mort@@ als and ob@@ itu@@ aries .
every two years training courses are offered for new employees .
the tablets described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
also there other personal wishes can be recorded on post@@ cards .

the lower outlook comes despite the price increases aver@@ aging 4.@@ 9 percent and effective on January 4 and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ ship transport of heavy and large packages , which are collected from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will be increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue , and growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO , Fred Smith said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company considers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid income if one considers the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in production and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday occupation were announced a day later than those of the rival UPS who plans to employ 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra workers , approximately the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex served $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted twelve analysts surv@@ eyed by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion dollars .
six of the analysed analysts envis@@ aged a $ 12.@@ 23 billion anticipated .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has seen a decline in international priority shipping over the last few years , which brought sales in its unit Express shipments to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex ground .
in the last quarter sales of bo@@ d@@ ship transport increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ assurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result fell due to higher labor costs in the cargo business .
in the market trade , about one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares sank by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most anticipated conference in the year Federal Reserve Strate@@ gies spend two days this week round a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to lift the Lei@@ tz@@ in for the first time for almost a decade .
threatening above them at the end of the decorated , two @-@ stor@@ eyed meeting hall is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that F@@ ed Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from Congress : keeping US employment and prices stable here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentives by the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the economic data show that it grows solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxi@@ ously to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal loans - and it is only a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing to observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text not to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which insur@@ es in itself the financial market .
roughly half of the econom@@ ists , recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted a rise in interest this week .
however , the financial markets expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts l@@ essen the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial Target j@@ umped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy maintains the proposition in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the pro@@ positions at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a rate increase would paci@@ fy the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence was expected .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives stated that the main reason is the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and need it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world kn@@ itted together at the end of last month after China had utilized its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value dropped by more than 16 % in May when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would reduce global growth .
the market has recovered somewhat this month , whereas the D@@ ow is now nearly 10 % below the top of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation , when to increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins in this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ GF@@ - Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and former staff of the US central bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision @-@ making process .
but in the end the F@@ ed Monetary Committee has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
the mere hint of the former leader Ben S Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down its monetary expansion &quot; spark@@ ed con@@ fu@@ sions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect them not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management at En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; F@@ ed has a history of over @-@ reactions on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundam@@ entals . &quot;
Lack@@ ner , co @-@ ordin@@ ator of the Federal Open Market Committee , which applies to interest rates , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ ner .
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives cancelled these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis such as the market crisis in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est Sett@@ lement of the Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ences don &apos;t come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly won &apos;t get into the situation in which she is afraid of a rise in interest because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , president of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe it should hurry ahead .
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is commonly referred to as Thai Cost@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market that is also sold to the general public .

the shop is huge and it takes about an hour to stroll through the ais@@ les .
if the whole shopping basket makes you hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express for you .
the bar@@ gain ( good and cheap ) in this shop is located near the cas@@ hier and has various pick @-@ up options .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
even in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a lot of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach her 74 different l@@ ences .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ er at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
there they help refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , this is quite different teaching than at a real school .
Brazilian P@@ edi@@ at@@ ric Rio Grande encourages nutrition for healthy breast @-@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to inform women in a shock@@ ing way how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of images of babies that su@@ ck breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ oric intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research indicates that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary modification that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ried Sports Hall
the Municipal Council Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for the solar system .
the plans for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn@@ around in the Bern@@ ried Sports Area are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council meeting , the elabor@@ ated construction application was unanim@@ ously approved without great discussions .
the committee had previously decided to apply for a legislative &quot; exception &quot; or &quot; liberation &quot; from a valid cultivation plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was permitted for a special form regarding the roof structure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gab@@ led roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be constructed with a first and a roof covering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background planning is the intended utilisation of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this brings together a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it was again about the attic that is supposed to lie below ten degrees from energy reasons - unlike in the construction plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was necessary because the development plan on the pitch does not allow any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - with the Bern@@ ried community at liberty to be rather restric@@ tive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the turn@@ around is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sports hall construction at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros have been calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from the promotion of schools and l@@ ati@@ tudes .
in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be presented to the administrative office for testing .
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of the employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White confirmed .
the Supervisory Board , however , will make a decision on this and that will take place next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority should mig@@ rate to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au are to be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change has spark@@ ed the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year , and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who will succeed , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name of &quot; Fischer , &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from October 1 and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this was in any case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area of Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised on the inside station on gastro@@ enter@@ ologic diseases .
in passing over the next two years , Fischer and his team will continue with his team if the Supervisory Board agrees to both houses , until next year the former hospital of Kn@@ app@@ enheim , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refur@@ bish@@ ment is completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , prot@@ ested against the fact that the house , which is owned by the federal government , is to be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shut it out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the reloc@@ ation to Le@@ ch , which had been received by the staff &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as chief physician for over 30 years has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been repeatedly threatened by closure in recent decades , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ balls of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are demanded tonight ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) at Berg@@ isches HC .
although the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Wuppertal is the clear favourite , there is no occasion for arro@@ gan@@ ce .
in the past season , the people in Bh@@ c had a painful defeat and got something good there .
hunting Dark@@ fall with Two Ver@@ ses at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon by shots .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use , as the police announced .
after a shot of a shot , an 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was not clear at first .
the criminal police determined .
16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday .
in the inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their dead bodies were thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violent crimes .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police announced on Wednesday .
in fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old det@@ ained also on Tuesday evening , who , in fact , conf@@ essed the indication and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first encountered personal objects of the victim .
in the event of inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the presum@@ ed perpet@@ r@@ ator led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
the det@@ ain@@ ee reported to the authorities in the police inter@@ ro@@ gation that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and laid the cor@@ p@@ se in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the fun@@ nel on Wednesday , and the investig@@ ators put a burden on him .
the further investigations are intended to provide information on the near@@ er circumstances of the action .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable lead .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the arriving refugees and job seek@@ ers from the EU more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would need to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the Association of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing Architecture &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
140@@ ,000 apartments are therefore missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an original shelter .
many then stum@@ ble onto the housing market and enter the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the latter year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes considerable om@@ is@@ sions in the residential construction policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a housing deficit which will grow from year to year .
currently , some 7@@ 70@@ ,000 residential units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compl@@ ained Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in big cities in need of forced accommodation in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stay in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a long time because of the vac@@ ations on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has dropped again for the first time in recent years .
in order to solve the problem , the &quot; social housing construction &quot; alliance proposes a re@@ boot .
in doing so , new incentives should revi@@ ve social housing construction .
thus , the property tax could be wai@@ ved and the land tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats will be suspended .
in addition , according to the alliance , attractive tax depreciation is required .
the funding programme for refugee shel@@ ters from the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the € 300 million had already been rec@@ alled on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free access : Croatia and Slovenia set corridor
there is practically no passing through to Hungary , as more and more refugees vote on the way to Croatia .
Zagreb is announc@@ ing the transit of Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous yet .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Slovenian interior minister , and if necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the shut@@ down of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to go from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported by the Croatian television broad@@ ca@@ ster RT@@ L .
Hungary closed its border on refugees on the eve of the day before .
new laws that came into force on the same day also practically obvi@@ ate the need for decent asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took up the first refugees on the Serbian border to the EU neighbouring country in Croatia in the morning .
according to media reports , most of the media reports are from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived both by bus and taxis in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to reach Croatia on foot via the green border .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter barriers .
but there are other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a secure passage .
after Hungary , however , hardly any more refugees come after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 attacked people .
shortly before the end of the gate on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws organize the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a criminal off@@ ence .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungary border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years imprisonment and deport@@ ation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were taken to the newly established &quot; transit zones &quot; on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
practically nobody has a prospect of getting asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected rub@@ b@@ ish that had left tens of thousands of people on the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
barrier @-@ bars have been disman@@ tled and one of the shooting camps in the bor@@ der@@ line has been reconstructed .
no one wanted to express himself to the goal of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but about 20.000 migrants still remained in the country according to government information .
in Salzburg , approximately 1400 people wait for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by the instruction of German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot regularly .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Brück@@ en@@ fest on Sunday , we were busy with the clearing , when suddenly ten people with travel officers stood at the entrance to the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Pas@@ sau .
because Germany un@@ expect@@ edly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the stream of refugees , it was at the end for them in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the frames together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Pas@@ sau .
before we got the unexpected guests at first , with snack and drinks .
we have said the same thing , we bring them by car to Pas@@ sau .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man was not allowed to take a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening , the str@@ anded train passengers had moved from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Pas@@ sau in order to make it possible after the short notice that rail traffic was stopped in Germany , but still over the border .
but the regional train was put off at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest combined with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , on the day before a two @-@ round trip spor@@ tily - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent a further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy : &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of helping in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the establishment of structures that guarantee humanity , our chan@@ cell@@ or has officially moved the attitude of the Hungarian government into the ha@@ ze of National Socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chao@@ tic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to notice that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but a further refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a major challenge , given the ongoing flood of refugees and the coming winter , to create decent conditions for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter fort@@ resses
Konrad has all his hands full to do with the submission of refugees .
Christian Konrad used to have his word weight .
the government has deployed the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to place quarters for thousands of refugees .
Konrad already got a grip on the chaos in the first reception centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported on his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees , which had come to Austria on Monday , was also without great hu@@ stle and bu@@ stle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 85@@ ,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , more than 35@@ ,000 accommodations need to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the Gover@@ nor .
they had promised him to create lod@@ g@@ ings even for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , to clarify how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations also in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping how we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private persons can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for placing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that district hosts must maintain a certain height of the towel holder or the size of the duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to be valid for a temporary period of time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , in contrast to the Ministry of Interior , Con@@ rad is based on his experience .
I am an elderly gent@@ leman , whom one does not say without further into the face the fal@@ seh@@ ood .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not bear the costs of the Republic as they themselves stated .
their number of employees want to increase it to three to four .
up to now , our own quest for accommodation has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being , there will be no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and design center for the placing of refugees in the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since the persons concerned can currently be accommod@@ ated without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , other sites are to be tested for their suitability .
criticism of the city chief on the breakdown of refugees among the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a long telephone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday confirmed the further action in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the continuation of refugees into the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no special features with refugees in Germany for the time being .
however , the seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria &apos;s borders again introduce controls again is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans for P@@ ühr@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industry line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly tra@@ ded IT Group is moved to S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can imagine investing in Star@@ tup @-@ Fir@@ ms of the New shi@@ py@@ ard and later to acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euro 1.7 million has been invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which is one @-@ third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 2,@@ 700 square meters of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second store in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la Hand@@ bags .
actually J@@ utta B@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
the 49 @-@ year @-@ old woman of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade had to post@@ p@@ one this project in a short time : after all , she has now acquired an increase in the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which it sells among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything now revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories costs up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have thought for a long time if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna from the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the big city of Linz who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have Italian roots themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has put Br@@ eit from her mother into the cra@@ dle .
most of all , when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so some woman is in rap@@ ture at the sight of a hand@@ bag , the professional woman can &apos;t answer with last safety .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag re@@ alizes every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ emaker from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are named investors .
this property also links some to the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become U.S. president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether he expresses himself in a foreign hostile mood , repor@@ ters are concerned or revealed knowledge gaps in international crisis policies - the candidate for the US presidential office is power@@ fully campaig@@ ning for the election campaign .
and cut off well .
this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire comes from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ fresh@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term for many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 inhabit@@ ant village is related to him over ump@@ teen corners .
his grandfather escaped from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they &apos;re somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native k@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous children , to which apart from Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also speaks at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while resp@@ ecting the performance of the family , it also tends to think that Tr@@ ump is a bit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big mau@@ l &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt around , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the don@@ or , says it .
therefore , Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of investors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the foundation stone of the real estate company was the first purchase in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland for a long time failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and People &apos;s Do@@ gs , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The grand@@ ma was born in Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the wine gro@@ wer in retirement sees the American rather dist@@ ancing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always up to four thousand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned like some K@@ all@@ anz@@ stad@@ ter that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family concluded something for the church organ when visiting the church organ , which was generally good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that of Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he did not win the election , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing in the USA at the time of his grandfather would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not my president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ri@@ pen@@ ed without the President Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , even in the USA the interest awak@@ ens .

Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son are ha@@ ste to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report after the loss of the leaders of the Liber@@ als , but there have been no major shifts in today &apos;s Today reviews .

today , Today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , Today has closed the gap in Sunrise .

this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently wi@@ dow@@ ed father , who decided to settle with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics had wonder@@ ed if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed heavily with 1.@@ 136 million spectators and hit the block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 p.m. ) of the new quiz show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e gave an average of 4@@ 46@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia was attended by 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour there was a total of 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars a minute that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ lap the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki possibly have unknow@@ ingly apparently who wins The Bachelor .
the woman at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor has been envel@@ op@@ ed in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one that has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you may have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood with@@ holds his lips sealed up to the final on Thursday
all three women have been ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should preserve W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; could their answers become the game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors .
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies noticed that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; Sarah is standing with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be a good pair .
from her perspective , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit of the house last week made it clear that wood could be &quot; the one . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly dis@@ continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ ned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30 PM .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a fight like the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ts did on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the match .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
in his press conference , Tom@@ sul@@ a also strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it certainly wasn &apos;t the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian band had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut back then in 2007 when a passport with his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a trip to Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as there were during the war in the 1990 &quot; s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to push the free elec@@ torate as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is why Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more staff for the administrative courts , which are responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W leader critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states throughout Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bayern sli@@ ps off , others not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more skilled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country &apos;s policy in large @-@ wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
many years of constant tor@@ ches remain on the agenda : education policy .
for the new school year , the Ministry of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; B1 ( CS@@ U ) at 47 high school high school students , where an extension of the secondary school was tested by three to four years .
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the German stock market has closed with profits after a long stretch of trend @-@ less and nervous trading .
only in the afternoon was a solid start of the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which finally promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upward .

in the US , the D@@ ow Jones Index listed 1 per cent in the plus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many stock markets expect markets to be placed on the spot until after the interest rate in the US and the major decline on the date stock markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the debate about the loads from the nuclear ph@@ ase@@ out has meanwhile pushed the RW@@ E shares to a record low and left its mark on E@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German energy companies may lack some 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 per cent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon stocks rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the D@@ ax peak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appeared from the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , investors gave too little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
the investment in future @-@ consuming wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .
Auto@@ values were required : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August more cars were set off again than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .

4 people killed after police arch@@ ers shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd of people demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , leading district administrator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and incen@@ diary bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said that the police used tear gas and then poured into the air before taking back on rubber floors .
twenty police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber s@@ als , known to be able to kill them , but they are traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last of weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ ri@@ ans say that new provinces being formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ arus , who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been violent alter@@ cations since the 10th .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been ruled central for centuries .
work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators have accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the Kath@@ mandu constitutional draft , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the plot at Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area .
planned is a mix of trade , commerce and housing - but there are no specific offers yet .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 square meter plot in close proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commerce and housing .
you wait for corresponding offers , it is said by the city .
which investor may be questioned is not yet clear .
no contracts had been concluded as well .
the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property that is located at the Ring@@ straße / Lower Main Street , bought some months ago and the building was demoli@@ shed .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of the holiday houses at the Little Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor had publicly presented plans for the project for the first time .
a number of residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their free @-@ time business
for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , shaken , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new Holiday Sett@@ lement on the Small Sea near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prospective , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System construction , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the order of the day .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP faction , who accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends with@@ drew from the system construction management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ours now .
the project has been in discussion for months of around ten to twelve million euros .
fierce reactions among the owners of the sea , who had come to the meeting , called out the pictures and new details of the hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , the owner of the sea and a member of the board , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant leap that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like some other project critics that the traffic would increase strongly due to the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be full bus charges for this to be reck@@ oned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well one hectare site of the former inn , however , is still open .
there is still no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ending . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the development plans were still variable .

Google launches campaign donations campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees inv@@ ade the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announc@@ ing the Don@@ ation call on his blog .
instead of making a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google associate , who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark train and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally @-@ collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / were doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .
coverage of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ umb
weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily obes@@ e diab@@ e@@ tics .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if lightly overweight people with diabetes may live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to eat food .
over the years , obesity operations for type 2 diabetes have proven to be efficient , but most studies have been carried out in people who are path@@ ologically obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c catar@@ r@@ h - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 2@@ 4.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately the same at 29 .
among those undergoing surgical operation , 36 % of the disease was completely dis@@ b@@ anded and at 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was dis@@ b@@ anded completely by only one percent and partially with only about two percent .
in addition , the results were better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride , and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood sugar level of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept at 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level fell by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as it is reflected in the improved h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , so the guiding researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the host family group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching greater responses in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete over@@ turn of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study reveals no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was about 29 percent less likely to die in obes@@ e people , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for individuals with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , without increased risk of death or kidney disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long before we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lov@@ est@@ ory plays in the Hun@@ sr@@ ück
it is a topic that is increasingly paid attention in Bell@@ et@@ ris@@ tik : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly at school times , meets the flock of her youth again after years , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recent novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the novel is likely to be interesting for Hun@@ sr@@ ück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is delighted that she could set up a literary monument to her home town .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for anyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 , pointing out that the US &apos;s violent reaction drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase of intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
poison control centers in the USA report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 , who swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand dis@@ infection , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , cases of income from hand dis@@ infection products for children under 12 years of age reporting the poison control centers were increased from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children increasingly come to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said some children intentionally drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens have pur@@ port@@ edly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol containing mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing for children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
even with small children , a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison emergency center at the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently had four sp@@ lashes of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in the school after straw@@ berry , was brought to an emergency room .
their blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally valid for an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated them at the Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah loved her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through alcohol and had pushed his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ infection books and store hands @-@ on disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women were killed in Ontario women after swal@@ lowing down disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities spec@@ ulate that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class of the New York State were planning to poison their &quot; gem@@ stone &quot; teacher by providing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and banned them from their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police examined the mis@@ erable plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
at a rear @-@ end collision at the cross@@ bar between Nordr@@ ing and In Her@@ der , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old driver has been slightly injured in a rear @-@ end collision .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver was driving on the cross p@@ liers in the direction of the industrial area and it was too late to notice that two vehicles ahead of the round@@ about had stopped at the round@@ about .
as a result , he colli@@ ded with his truck into the rear of an audi@@ torium and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fi@@ esta that stood before .
an accident damage of about 10,000 euros was created at the accident participants , dividing the police .
the Audi of the 33 year old was no longer ready for manoeu@@ vre and had to be tow@@ ed .

there are rum@@ ors about discre@@ p@@ ancy at Cel@@ tic Glasgow , which was spontaneously rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . this insist@@ ed that he and his team mates are not under increased control , as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch leader of the championship .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Cel@@ tic , because there is no title @-@ ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they don &apos;t show any highlights of Cel@@ tic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swear by Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted that Cel@@ tic must fight , but the Norwegian Chef s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who now stands at the top of the table with a margin of five points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had bad times before and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what is happening .
we feel this exactly the same - but we have to go on .
we really need to really support Cel@@ tic because that makes the players better .
to stand together is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is increasing overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom rose from 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the U@@ K@@ s 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Office for National Statistics ( O@@ NS ) showed .
meanwhile , employment in Scotland rose by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland rose to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I &apos;m witness@@ ing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I shall see how a man is brought to death .
if it happens and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the po@@ ison@@ ous sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since there are often more applications available than places , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery is held to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma reduced the number of media fields from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will observe it emo@@ tionally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps &apos;s closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma acc@@ uses me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better form@@ ulate it &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he was doing it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
if he dies , he thinks the public relations of the movement will help against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter for Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts which I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all the details here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
I am sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters that you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying out of unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ ades to get out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he talked to the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to susp@@ end the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water just a few meters away from a police officer trying to &quot; persu@@ ade him gently to return to the shore . &quot;
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale police were called on Tuesday for a breach of domestic peace in the town of Becken@@ ham .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of Cann@@ ing River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .

Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards trying to spy on him and thre@@ aten to end the race
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to stop the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive Cob@@ alt T@@ up@@ fer@@ sal at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had held back 18 months because of the sp@@ ying alleg@@ ations and did not want it to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know it went on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said .
tonight I will go home and sleep well .
I want to walk around the head , and I want my owners to think I &apos;m trying my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a trainer anymore .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they seem to me that I am a che@@ er .
if that is the case , they should certainly remember their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ dy , the reig@@ ning President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at that time and are still today .
should this bring me to the point that it is personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly attitude and makes people outside of coaches responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking outside that I am .
perhaps they have to accept my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now letting them think about it .
but I have arrived at the point where that doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ stration levels of the trainer set up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt @-@ examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to he said he could &quot; t@@ oss his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the failed Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees mistakenly put mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been the same yesterday as it was .
but it also had it on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy op@@ poses ri@@ vals for claims to ring fighting back
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of the tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as &quot; agenda setting &quot; of two Premier League Favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires have allowed the storm players &quot; w@@ rest@@ ling &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a hardly disgu@@ ised note to the storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy advoc@@ ated the tac@@ kl@@ ing of his crew and said that they were only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team made him feel confident , because they were worried that they were worried to be beaten by the storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this always appears - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about w@@ rest@@ ling , when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that during the whole year we have changed nothing about our defensive system or the techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real center of gravity and that has provided us with the trend revers@@ al .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not used to losing , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny as this always appears at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the premi@@ er league in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of soccer to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they can .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they did not think of us when it was about Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm vs. R@@ oo@@ ster game scored a higher score than the match Bron@@ zes against Cow@@ boys .
the play of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks doing and no points any exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game boards .
if they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the storm team is free on this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night in the semi @-@ fin@@ als at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
serving Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee on Dru@@ gs
a man who could potentially have a life @-@ long punishment due to his attempt to come to the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released for a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and put in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants at the marina in the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire quantity and that in the café he could have been a harmless background .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the risk of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday .
in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 together as security together in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it statements of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said judge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he signed his Australian and his Serbian passport , signed up with the police daily and sat at an exit barrier from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab tears apart
in a collision with three trucks on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved were standing in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver re@@ marked it too late and in vain attempted to escape to the left in the last minute , as the police announced .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident was torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ North was completely closed for six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
a damage was incurred in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used telephone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone as this slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of it and looked at the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; concerning &quot; web searches , which used terms to search for in@@ decent images of children .
Ho@@ gg then claimed to officials that he had done it as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the Internet &quot; and he then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction , that he was addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches on the computer were done by him , but he said it was because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the images he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was at tre@@ mor and tears .
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the def@@ end@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the def@@ end@@ ant used computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty in terms of the indictment , to have in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year to have viol@@ ated the requirements and not to appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defense lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the Register of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sex@@ ual Cri@@ mes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as one could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to obtain background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted a deposit in this case , but was kept in custody due to hear@@ ings to other cases pending .
he was still included in the list of sexual off@@ ences before the date of judgment .
bad user switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are being taken up from the great control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
due to fear of discovery and arrest , many floo@@ ders increased the number of people at smaller border cross@@ ings .

the crowd makes it : every two years , the car manufacturers show their innovations at the IAA .
in 2015 , it is mainly moving to the compact cars that are currently particularly well @-@ sold .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) alone in August this segment .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy of human dignity
the Federal Constitutional Court has granted an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the prison prison Te@@ gel , which was placed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are basically entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , suffer@@ ers may even hope for money if they were confined within confined spaces within a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated from space .
after that , according to his lawyer , the man , who is now on the bare foot , had been moved to a larger cell .
his administrative detention for the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the Land of Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dge raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ als and referred the case for re @-@ trial .
they see the human dignity of the man hurt .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons , only a few days of imprisonment for compensation are decisive for compensation , a statement of compensation was given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a atro@@ city of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
so they only spoke to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April because he was imprisoned in a cell naked .
according to a decision of 2011 , the multi@@ layer assignment of a cell without separate toilet is un@@ worthy .
in addition , Karlsruhe recently confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had an in@@ decent housing to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff at that time was lod@@ ged daily between 15 and 21 hours daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons came into the head@@ lines for the last few weeks as well because of missing personnel .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness asc@@ ends , even to bats it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ stelle , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to lack of young ac@@ adem@@ ics , 19 are expected to drop off in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept it .
what is coming to Germany ?
according to Deputy Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) showed determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses , between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Germany ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are used every year - the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up until now ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all in affordable rental properties : 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing from the rent @-@ up bond issue each year , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , from now 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
far too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing annually would have to be created and the federal government would have to invest a grant of 6.@@ 4 billion euros a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; researchers and federal mini@@ stries agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in residential construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter critic@@ ises , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation .
but the integration of refugees is crucial if they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the record society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Bon@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to the th@@ ron@@ age , there has been a political turn@@ around : from the ban on labour for refugees to the recognition of labour .
whereas previously there was a ban on working for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as is the residence obligation that limits asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour - the view is mostly made that refugees should be able to access the labour market sooner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large barrier to access to the labour market is lacking knowledge of German .
until now , there is still no adequate supply of general and occupational language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated through personal contact .
for this reason , the development of networks is , according to the view of the Thr@@ es@@ hardt , the Royal Road to Labor Integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 per cent : &quot; for the un@@ rooted parents it is very important to hold the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ya Ko@@ ol@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration .
to convince the family nevertheless of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators to rise strongly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase its training capacities - for instance by allowing more vocational schools .
in the countries , students with no knowledge of German will be prepared for lessons .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ cases from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no Federal Land has allowed asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception to date was Berlin , Interior sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for refugees with a reimbur@@ sement or des@@ ul@@ ment do not receive any benefits according to the asylum application Act more if they start a course of study .
the latter generally do not get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , as they do not fall under the circle of the bene@@ fici@@ ary persons .
tolerated refugees have had to live in Germany for four years so far to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months .
but also this gap must be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and religion is an important part of their identity for many .
the state should gradually admit to Islam the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state @-@ church law to develop into a new state @-@ religions relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association that takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
the rights also include duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried out in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to pursue such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law into Arabic .
in future , integration will be much more than a topic of the whole society .
this will also change the majority society , and the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be more pressing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law for almost a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it lear@@ ns very slowly how the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ al series showed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans are calling for long and obli@@ ge international agreements like anti @-@ rac@@ ism in Germany must become a reality in the coming years if the country remain peaceful and its new citizens want to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to previously expected refugees , says MD Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of man@@ power and capacities , we create this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery ur@@ ges to susp@@ end health cards for all arri@@ vals .
services rendered could later be accounted for by the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to pick up so many people with the limited service catalogue , which the asylum application law stipul@@ ates .
otherwise , doctors primarily make language barriers .
even so far , the Berlin healthcare scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are more poorly informed about their diseases than other patients .
it is not only in clinics , but also in medical practices that interpre@@ ting costs have to be taken over , she demands .
many refugees , however , would also be helped with more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among the refugee children , for example , there are clearly more un@@ equal disabilities , and among the young people it is about HIV @-@ awareness .
but with some of the other diseases , German doctors come from their training , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the lack of health , the refugees may even be allevi@@ ated in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have a highly developed education system , and several refugees are even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take examinations again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill according to estimates by the Federal psycho@@ therapy association ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
they are particularly vulnerable to refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee boy is traumati@@ sed in Germany .
those who suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and fear of death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration difficulties , severe fri@@ ght and emotional de@@ af@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment was necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
up to now , however , only four per cent of the mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can make an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , mostly cler@@ ks or doctors who are not trained in psych@@ ic diseases decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream

the aim is to attract each age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now , the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the Man@@ ege on the Bri@@ ck .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ ader and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current stage of management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift to the devil is thus in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to take away people from their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man@@ e@@ ather cocktail with cos@@ mop@@ olitan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometer tour can now experience this flair .
the Circus program impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
also the Cas@@ tillo Brothers understand their craft .

light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art on the mast is supposed to conquer the hearts of women in a storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ v@@ ings , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and ag@@ ility .

60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often a topic with different animal welfare organisations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst takes a stand : &quot; if it &apos;s not good for our animals , we don &apos;t go well . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called lov@@ ingly , are read from the eyes every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena either .
thus , the first commandment : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid isn &apos;t ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whe@@ ther there are five or 1 200 spectators , we always do our best and are there with all our heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites from 17 to 20 September daily at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. to his performances .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
Thursday is the family day , the prices are reduced for the performance at 5 p.m .

Zimbabwe Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , desc@@ ended from a podium in the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall spread quickly over the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by asser@@ tions by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe with calls .
last month , they had rested and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation in Parliament - this is what he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told journalists about Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the members of parliament that the immunity in parliament ends , and once they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party managed by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for the politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to employ 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing business hardware and service business activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP President and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; says Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than USD 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing un@@ parall@@ eled , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement .
it spl@@ its a company founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical equipment and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to handle the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the newest in this area , based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide a better performance .
FC Ar@@ senal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is going according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of his story , his participation in the European Championship will surely remain uncertain in the next summer .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also acknowled@@ ges , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has reported 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 league players in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for ar@@ senal is that they have been one of the two Premier League Clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , who have experienced most of the infrin@@ gement days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the injury margin will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body will stabili@@ ze , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
ar@@ senal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger is a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are allowed to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and to treat the players who need it a little break @-@ off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although ar@@ senal &apos;s clear favorites to continue by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir arena in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dating effect in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign was launched last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was shocked by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that ar@@ senal has drawn up the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven from distant hope to lead the association to its first European capital triumph with its management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immen@@ sely , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked at Ar@@ senal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ fes@@ tivity : the Com@@ edy @-@ Show , which gave us serious lessons on male friend@@ ships
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is evident especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably announced 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of ques@@ tioning the culture that men are preventing to seek help when they need them .
friendship is at the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms determined that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends once so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication managed through social media , with its focus on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire told recently , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty at Friends was that this focus was put on my head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which shine through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments in soccer gaz@@ ing in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often with@@ hold their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like an employee of telephone pastoral care , he explained to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; My key role for people who feel de@@ pressed and vulnerable , really showed me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it presents clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider state over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the completely re@@ designed scenery to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates on Malm@@ ö with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ dy Cav@@ ani .
in his debut in the Champions League , Maria met on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ dy Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main launched his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ Park@@ stadi@@ on on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who made the French champion his way , but after that she missed a number of opportunities before she finally increased her advance when Cav@@ ani scored a head @-@ on in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , as they not only strive for the kno@@ bs but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed chances in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the club with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things we have to perf@@ ected over the course of the season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two other goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned in one of three changes to the Paris team , which could last a 2 : 2 tie at his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was st@@ umped by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian wing storm was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he passed in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he passed Johan Wil@@ and passed beautifully into the long corner of the network .
however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine nation@@ alists in the field and was lined up with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field a heavy opponent .
but except for a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who went far to Kevin Tra@@ pps pop@@ s in the 3@@ 4th minute , they did little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G sometimes appeared , with some failures and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who in no less than five attempts alone was scrat@@ ched in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani started it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which turned Di Maria into a shot , which was distra@@ c@@ ted by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved its sixth season gate after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had found a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö can come back into play , and only an outstanding intervention by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before replacement player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have only played in the Swedish League , which has not the same level .
the qualifying matches are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented change to FC Bayern in 2008
world and European Champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obvious some years ago shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger , four times champion league winner , twice world champion , twice world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ av@@ i reveals that he was already standing before the European Championship in 2008 before the departure from Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid then won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered sign of FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardian was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this work today for the German record master : pe@@ p Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns playing time in 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the whole distance on the lawn , the red turned out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s King triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays down diversity in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion of the variety and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
as a result of the Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown highlighted the need for alternative perspectives while referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not in the line @-@ up of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ting un@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments from the actor of The Mar@@ tian continued to soli@@ di@@ fy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to encourage people to think about it - whoever will be the director , as they treat the character of the harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said at first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a groove , beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on answered that their direction &quot; in the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded by dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Po@@ oni Twitter user expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their variety - this is SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tweet earned more than 5,000 re@@ trac@@ ts and 4,000 li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
when the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement had a national impact and urged the legisl@@ ator and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against the am@@ bush .
in February , singer Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album still@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement published a statement in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ l invited to attend the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or met the pop@@ e is unclear .
American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns the first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and help aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million .
the competition show , which had just finished its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman moved Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten to the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge for three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard fought victory , still under shock about winning the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or have had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
Executive producer K@@ ent We@@ ed went to the Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he was the first to finish the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it will be the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he h@@ ates any gru@@ dge about it .
he has just been so happy to have done what he did .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had exchanged roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit tiger cu@@ dd@@ les past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tiger .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
the T@@ wins used a chance to climb inside one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card .
for Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word which was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tiger manager Brad out@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at bul@@ l@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go into the game very concentrated .
the designed Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle nav@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sw@@ ung the wood well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( kick training ) , looked clearly better from the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three rounds in the back at the end of the seventh inner the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks achieved Bun@@ t , and Simon made his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ h@@ ander Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run escape from the righ@@ ty Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the final run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play
after Detroit started an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth interior , the wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed man , however , sp@@ un S@@ ano in three pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit benefited at the start of the game by a non @-@ mo@@ ve@@ able Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been painted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after having been missing more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ B@@ atter , Hus@@ ks gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman , Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z led Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z accomplished his 0 @-@ 21 series of successes with the Run@@ ners in scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers arrived in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE on 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he didn &apos;t beat very well , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
remarks : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the litter shoulder .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder @-@ sh@@ red@@ der , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is canc@@ eled by the vulner@@ ability list to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he was missing from the 20th of August because of a ten@@ don in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games at the target field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees to come to Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the affected people will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
it was counting 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several sport halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital had been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees are temporarily accommod@@ ated there .
they are then to be distributed to other commun@@ es .
in the last ten days , according to the government pres@@ idency responsible for the initial up@@ take , 7@@ 500 people in Hessen have arrived in H@@ esse .
due to the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also furnished emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive re@@ thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he repro@@ ached the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , it was glad that the cup of military participation in Germany passed by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is landing on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees .
Austria controls the southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Austrian Minister for the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on Tuesday evening in Austrian television broad@@ ca@@ ster ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
also Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement in which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Security and Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Germany .
she did not call her specific figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria on the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their destination is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , requested a special summit for next week .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers will take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees .
in view of the strong refugee ship in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries more strongly in the first @-@ time and distribution of people .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , and in the late Tuesday evening , Merkel announced after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined that those people who needed protection would also receive it .
but those who do not have a lead perspective could not stay in Germany either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this view was strongly split in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort of force &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate exo@@ dus are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania could also be cleared with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary &apos;s foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence , Hungary wanted to prevent the ski@@ pper to seek alternative routes over Romania .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , meanwhile , e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported thousands more migrants on their way to the Greek border .
room probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds Ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
a global ocean sw@@ aps beneath the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of Saturn &apos;s En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
this is followed by researchers from observations from the space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
thus the moon stag@@ gers on its orbit around the ring planets .
this motion is small but still too big for a solid body of cel@@ esti@@ al body , in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fac@@ t@@ sheet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already discovered ice @-@ volcan@@ oes at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds in 2006 , sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama is missing in Munich in 1860 for several weeks
the 1860 München has to ren@@ ounce around one month on the offensive player Val@@ det R@@ ama .
an investigation has resulted in an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
at the beginning of the week R@@ ama had lam@@ ented about pain .
according to the Munich @-@ based lion , the diagnosis &quot; is expected to take four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ on loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director Nec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of an un@@ compromising professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but as a training guest , the Six@@ ties presented a defensive one at first .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je c@@ ale was recently active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at currently has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Austrian national player is supposed to enter the running training on Thursday .
in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) , O@@ ko@@ tie was injured in a violent clas@@ h on the head .
but in spite of the first fears he remained without a serious cens@@ orship .
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy and sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to his slender line are often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : in them B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. How@@ ever , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre@@ amplifier beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
who eats the fruits thus supports ey@@ esi@@ ght , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasantly .
the peel color alone tells nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
however , a man@@ go also gives hear@@ ty dishes a special touch .
it mi@@ tig@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and ven@@ ison .
the US package service UPS returns up to 9@@ 5,000 aid for the Christmas business in the USA .
the company had already started recru@@ iting seasonal workers , UPS agreed on Tuesday .
especially drivers are being sought .
in the past year , UPS had raised its workforce by 9@@ 5,000 hel@@ pers for the holiday season .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , UPS and his rival F@@ ed@@ Ex have been taking precau@@ tions since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business .
in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel services .
first indul@@ gence , then striking cold front
in the coming night , the f@@ öhn stops in the valleys of the Alp@@ enn@@ onite side , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland hur@@ ried on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the F@@ öhn blows partly with storm force through the fo@@ aming pe@@ eler .
after passing on Thursday morning we cross a prominent cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area above the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west current .
on the mountain side of the Alps , the hair@@ dryers ran through the valleys in the night .
the F@@ öhn blows in the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys with bends from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and partly also partly with over 100 km / h in the Ur@@ ner@@ land .
the fo@@ eh@@ n can in some places advance to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and even hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday turbul@@ ent fo@@ eh@@ n ensures summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees , the moisture at the slopes begins to st@@ ow .
the rain starts here , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , in the next 48 hours south of the Alps , some more than 100 liters of rain per square meter must be reck@@ oned with , this after a large amount of rain has already fallen in the last days .
on Thursday morning the wind blows from the f@@ öhn . as a result , a cold front with a strong , partially weather@@ ed rain from West to East over Switzerland rolls .
together with the cold front , the wind remains strong until stor@@ my , and temperatures rise clearly .
the following days present in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny on the weekend and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io hill on Wednesday was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ former .
on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Association of Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es over the centuries were often only able to live in secret their faith .
with the square , symbo@@ lically it becomes visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stood as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city as a rotten sin@@ ner .
according to histori@@ ans his negative impressions should have reinforced him in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses on the deal@@ ings of goods .
hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated the Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with splendid images .
in the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated in 150 motifs his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it can be quite glo@@ omy .
Ot@@ mar Alt worked for about three years in his bi@@ ble project , for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books .
these are cycles , which dev@@ ote themselves to topics such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments or fa@@ ther@@ land .
he immediately became fascinated by several partners : this applies to Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books .
and there is primarily the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible passages chosen by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , into current contexts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts about the situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict prot@@ est@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ der Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was an up@@ bringing already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he re@@ members Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to stop working so as to be able to bring me again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to revi@@ ve art in a quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped today by advertisement , and that is loud .
symboli@@ sm is displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; fall &quot; into the images , let them appear , discover and sense the force they have : &quot; the image is looking for its opposite . &quot;
on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost had always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old have not taken care not to fully grasp the Bible , but chosen the most important and mysterious themes for him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it &apos;s about the pictures , the text just explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emerged as a Picture Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for M@@ öh@@ ler , Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
part of the original - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on 15 November .
start of construction for BM@@ X railway .
plans made , place found , company commissioned to model earth moun@@ ds for a circuit : a year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was already finished .
om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration caused a confusion especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hill de@@ ported , looking for new space - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the hom@@ etown of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate his approval in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should be started with the work of the former indoor pool without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear sign on the weekend .
the football respon@@ ds to the wor@@ sen@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its aid in tac@@ kl@@ ing the problems facing it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe this is the biggest challenge of our country since unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be an interest in every individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he plans to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or next Wednesday and meet the minister of state Mrs. O@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly play a central role in this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must place politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the margins of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 professionals spend a clear signal on the left tri@@ cot , instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) , &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sport director Ru@@ di Vö@@ ller with the &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a matter of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee tragedy is everyone , no one can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use the Bundes@@ liga , no , we must use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
on Friday the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Championship Quali@@ fication game against Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 ro@@ y@@ alties had started their own projects in their places was great .
it is just as great that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year and next year , the association together with the DF@@ B sel@@ ections and the Federal Government will each provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : the head of the Management Board loses sight of an accident
according to several reports , the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he wore in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bleeding , he was power@@ less , he then dra@@ gged out into the street - he told us so last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an interview with the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung ( Thursday edition ) Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come to Germany in October and will continue to run the software company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full of SAP full of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can do something like this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again if you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren &apos;t spare pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except skir@@ mis@@ h ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he therefore comes as little as spare @-@ driver for the two Stam@@ mp@@ il@@ ots Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button in Singapore on the weekend as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ lows in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group match of the Europa League have definitely broken .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ el with the FK K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7@@ pm / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach got open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high strain on its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his stem position on the Re@@ us position .
he thus announced a change in the gate &apos;s position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of Chief Apostle Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion .
however , Tu@@ ch@@ el made frank@@ ly whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be used in all Europa League games in the future .
with high probability he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ mid@@ able statement by fellow player Re@@ us that the final campaign for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal is to keep Julian W@@ eig@@ l &apos;s mid @-@ field player understandable : &quot; that &apos;s why Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants leadership for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be technological leader in the change of the car .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the Frankfurt Motor Show , Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who come together with industry representatives at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport under@@ lines among other things the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid move to digital radio .
to test new technology , there is currently a test track on the auto@@ bahn 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; avoid any additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wishes to review the legal framework and , wherever necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use international standards to raise the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only envis@@ ages the human being as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economics , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways can be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany are estimated by the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
but the Germans are still skep@@ tical about self @-@ prop@@ elled cars - much more than French or Americans .
a survey commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the testing organisation Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will be able to en@@ force in the next ten years , 32 percent only in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents estimate up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , 33 percent in the U.S. .
drivers in Germany are not yet ready to completely rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey by the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control during the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could nevertheless imagine 15 percent , in traffic jam 45 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every fourth person would leave the car under no circumstances under any circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll claims team and double start at table tennis EM
according to current status , the Düsseldorf @-@ based Düsseldorf wants to open only in the individual on the title fight of September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision will be made no later than 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the boys learned it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said federal coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf at the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor appointment in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the settlements in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded of the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo also lack@@ ed , and we have become European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the fifth @-@ fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the British football player Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United has bred a serious injury on the right leg .
in the Champions League game at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , the defender was hit by a Tac@@ kl@@ ing by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and changed after a long treatment .
the first diagnosis in the 20 @-@ year @-@ old fellow player of Bas@@ tian pigs was pointing to a sh@@ ale .
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an enf@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figures horror movie : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins which look horri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the enf@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it used to be ble@@ ached , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From pav@@ ement to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good luck that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just fine clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which much effort was carried out : in order to indul@@ ge the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was specially engaged .
the makers have made 14 tonnes of material according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest , there was another special treat : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can also see Gau@@ l &apos;s old t@@ ed@@ dy bear in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashionable steps of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
playing with a doll would not have allowed his parents to play .
he later taught the designing of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first fashion show he won &apos;t be able to pay the models .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ dry tip as a fashion niche
in the past it went on the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were produced in a large quantity for customers , who , for example , processed them for blankets and curtains .
that alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en Cou@@ ples .
instead , fashion is important again .
fashion plays a major role in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt names some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects past styli@@ stic periods , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already do half of all orders .
merry P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien along with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
there are almost no private specialised shops and wholesale businesses .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , the mass @-@ produced commodity is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is sold almost exclusively through chains .
in addition , exports are slu@@ gg@@ ish , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the US .
enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to focus on environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the embroi@@ dery per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; we have been running a seal of quality since this year , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berg regional office of the West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ invented the historic snow@@ ball tip .
at the same time , the machine embroi@@ ders small balls at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing master Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not do anything previously with traditional P@@ lau@@ en lace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surrounding area and want to have a mem@@ ento .
so I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney introduces new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
you shouldn &apos;t touch legends , but Disney vent@@ ures to a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; it is not a new movie , but a kind of continuation , which takes 20 years after the first movie with the magic n@@ anny .
it &apos;s about the experiences of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the Great Depression in England .
those who play P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws are still unclear .
but the director already stands firm : Ro@@ b Marshall , recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI pus@@ hes to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to expand wider to the outside to foster growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was tas@@ ked with steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an address at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Committee for deep@@ ening comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote new spin @-@ offs and promote reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Leadership Group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list for the regulation of the market access , relaxation of the border controls policy , the promotion of state operations ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments .
the system is tested gradually and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of importance , as it as@@ signs the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , guarantees a legal state of affairs and forms the market more open , said the statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen up checks on the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
in the context of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded enterprises and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of lawyers to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli also took part in the report published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury level in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission plans to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and thus significantly increase the dose of the ven@@ ous tox@@ in to consumers .
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding EU working document , critic@@ ised the agenda : &quot; risks and side effects failed industrial and environmental policy with full force on pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish are to be increased from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limit values approximately 50 percent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ voc@@ able .
in return for this attrac@@ tiveness , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to shar@@ pen the limit values of other fish currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are mostly so low , that they are already adher@@ ing to the planned maximum values already today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dy defl@@ ection manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal highly toxic to humans , which is strongly enriched by the food chain mainly in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small quantities can cause damage to the nervous system especially in un@@ born injuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry says on its homepage with regard to the valid limits but that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard for the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly driven by coal combustion into the environment .
according to a written information from the German Federal Environment Ministry , German coal @-@ fired power plants meet more than six tonnes of mercury per year , two @-@ thirds of total Germany @-@ em@@ itted total .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and comprehen@@ sively exceeded &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; had the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mirror &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted in March from paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
