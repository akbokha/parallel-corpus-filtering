this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; it applies only to matters such as time and proced@@ ural rules and agreements for reporting , but does not include endor@@ sement or intelligence of military activity and does not apply to the following use of the core material .
the Organization , the Community and the States bear the costs arising from each of them in carrying out their respective obligations under this Convention .
if the community , the states or persons subject to their sovereign power , however , are extra@@ ordinarily costs as a result of a special su@@ sten@@ ance of the organisation , the organisation will reimbur@@ se these costs as long as it has been clari@@ fied in advance .
in any case , the organization carries the costs of all additional measurements and sampling frames required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
the Community and States ensure that the liability for nuclear damages , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with their laws and other provisions , to the Organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same manner as to the nationals of the States .
any claim that the Community or a State may asser@@ t against the organization or the organization vis @-@ à @-@ vis the association or a state owing to damages - except for damages arising from a nuclear incident - arising from the implementation of the securing measures under this Convention shall be governed in accordance with international law .
after verification of the relevant information submitted by the General Director , the Council shall ensure that the organisation is not capable of veri@@ fying itself by proving that no nuclear material , which must be subject to securing measures for nuclear weapons or other nuclear br@@ anded bodies , may report the reports provided in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Articles of Association and , if necessary , also take action from other measures provided .
in such steps , the Council , in which measures , has been attained by the measures applied to securing measures , takes into account the community or the state - as far as each of the two contractual parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to provide the Council with the necessary certainty .
consultations on questions that arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention on request of the organization , the community or a state shall be consul@@ ted .
the Community and the States are entitled to request that any questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
with the exception of disputes made pursuant to Article 19 or any measure adopted by the Council pursuant to Article 19 or any of the measures adopted by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be submitted to an arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal by a party consisting of five arbit@@ rators on the request of a party .
the Community and the States design@@ ate two arbit@@ rators , the organization also design@@ ates two arbit@@ rators , and the four arbit@@ rators elect a fifth to pres@@ ide .
if the Community and the States or the Organization have not designated two arbit@@ rators within thirty days after the request for an Ar@@ bit@@ ration , the Community or the Organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these refer@@ ees .
the same procedure should be applied if the fifth refer@@ ee has not yet been elected within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are competent and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbit@@ rators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are binding for the organisation , the community and the countries concerned .
a ) This Convention shall apply to non @-@ nuclear states , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the community , in force , i ) if the respective state of the organization noti@@ fies that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention and
II ) if the association of the organization noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its security measures with regard to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other upon request of one of the contracting parties about a change of this Convention .
B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States .
C ) The General Director immediately instruc@@ ts all Member States of the Organization to am@@ end this Convention .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of part I on securing measures .
the objective of the safety measures fixed in this Convention is the timely detection of the junction of significant quantities of nuclear material of peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear br@@ anded bodies for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ r@@ ence from such a junction by the risk of early detection .
in order to obtain the target specified in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , linked with the spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the inspections by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which material quantity for each material balance zone specified for a certain period of time is specified with indication of accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen .
in carrying out their inspections , the organization , according to Article 3 , makes full use of the security system of the community .
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Materials in accordance with this Convention is based on an outline in material balance zones .
in the application of their security measures , the Community of de Proced@@ ures and Meas@@ ures will make use of the following types of use and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are defined in the supplementary agreements and are practical :
a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise derived core material and inventory ;
B ) the evaluation of reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) methods for the determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) methods for ass@@ essing the accumulation of un@@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
( F ) a report and report system reporting the core material inventory for each material balance zone and the changes in this inventory , including the input and output of the material balance zone ;
g ) provisions which ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are correctly carried out ;
h ) Proced@@ ures for the reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the safety measures under this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore preparation .
( B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ containing material , which has not yet been reached by the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , is introduced into the states , so the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material unless it is introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) relies on core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of the fuel production or the is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is established , or is introduced into the states in a later stage of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other preventive measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the Community considers that the recovery of nuclear material , which is subject to securing measures under this Convention , is temporarily not possible or desirable for residues , so the organization and the community consult each other on the application of suitable securing measures .
B ) The safegu@@ ards envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organisation and the community agree that this core material is virtually non @-@ profitable .
upon request of the Community , the organization liber@@ ates the following core material from the securing measures under this Convention :
a ) Partic@@ ular fis@@ sile material , when used in gram@@ mes or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities pursuant to Article 13 if such nuclear material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
upon request of the Community , the organization liber@@ ates core material that would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this Convention , from these safegu@@ ards , if the total material quantity delivered by this article in the States is at no point at any time than
a ) a total of one kilogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Uran@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Uran@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ an@@ ium , is calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with a enrich@@ ment of more than 0.0@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.0@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if liber@@ ated core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the safety measures under this Convention , precau@@ tions are taken for the re @-@ application of the securing measures on that material .
the Community meets with the Organization Suppl@@ ementary agreements , which is necessary to the extent necessary for the successful and effective provision of the duties of the Organization under this Convention , in particular , as to the procedure laid down in the Convention .
the supplementary agreements can be extended or amended without amend@@ ment of this Convention in agreement between the Organization and the Community .
the supplementary agreements come into force at the same time or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the Organization , the Community and the States undertake all efforts to make these agreements come into effect within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
based on the initial report mentioned in article 62 , the organization establishes a summary directory of the entire core material underlying the securing measures of this Convention , regardless of its origin , and carries out this inventory directory on the basis of the following reports and the results of its audit .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , the United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other hand
the EW@@ G has decided to contribute to the special action programme set out at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general resource @-@ related problems .
C ) It is the aim of the EEC and Member States that the contribution made by Member States shall be bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible is spent within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
( D ) The EEC and its organisation have consul@@ ted one another about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the Organization of the EEC has presented a table from which it is clear in what way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this Agreement .
the organization establishes a special account under the term &quot; special ac@@ tional account &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the special transaction account ; this account is managed by the organization as administrator and used ( in this capacity , the organization is designated as &quot; ste@@ ward &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organisation .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or in@@ interest notes issued by the member state , which must be paid upon request in the currency of the respective state to the order of the organisation as administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the organization of the organization in the respective country .
( B ) Payment shall be made in two install@@ ments , and the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . within 30 days of the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker agreed upon date ;
II ) the second in the amount of the contribution of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or any other date agreed between the EEC and the Administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Each Member State may , upon request , make payments before the above mentioned dates .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes about proportion@@ ate drawing on the cash or the school j@@ unks to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account in a reasonable manner .
upon granting these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC :
( III ) the extent in which international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
( VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without discount ; and
( VII ) the extent to which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each special transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly ref@@ und@@ able development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral venture ) , irrespective of whether it is part of the organisation &apos;s loan programme or not , according to procedures and practices , which are considered , approved and administered for the ordinary funding of the organisation , with the aim of the bi@@ ble to be taken into account in this agreement .
the means of the special transaction account must not be used instead of the Bank &apos;s Bank &apos;s Bank &apos;s Bank or Organisation instead of the Ord@@ inary means , which are bound by a loan or loan in the context of a loan or loan , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organisation on the date of the entry into force .
apart from Section 4 , special re@@ payment loans are subject to the same payment terms , which are generally applicable to the organization granted by the organization ; they are therefore ref@@ und@@ able at ten free years each in 50 years .
bonds are granted in one or more currencies of Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for the payment of this bi@@ b must be paid directly to the organization that retains them .
each special bond loan must be rejected by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker , in particular the origin of the funds .
revenues from any special loan loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services manufactured or provided in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which , in accordance with what the car@@ et@@ aker has specified at the time of loan granted , may be a bene@@ fici@@ ary of a special transaction loan .
capital re@@ payments from a special transaction loan are made on the special transaction account , and the amount ref@@ unded in this way in the currency of a Member State shall be transferred back as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State concerned .
until full payment of all special offers , the administrator will instruc@@ t the EEC on the plans and programmes approved by the directors to be reviewed by the directors .
during the period of the payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator noti@@ fies the EEC four times a year on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made for this .
as soon as possible , the Administrator conve@@ ys a detailed billing of the special transaction account with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account statement as soon as possible after the business year of the organization .
after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the EEC will send a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and exec@@ utes appropriate records and invoices from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the obligations to be financed from the account recei@@ pts and the amounts paid out of the account and the withdraw@@ als made to the Member States .
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator until full edition of the means of the special transaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas on the status of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions and concerning all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , which the EEC and the organization had to agree , the agreement and all obligations arising from it shall become invalid with immediate effect .
if the total capital amount of all special loans claimed by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations resulting from it will be termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States notified the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings concerning them .
the General Sec@@ retariat passes these noti@@ fications along with a notification of the regular approval of this Agreement by the EEC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications by the organization .
this agreement is written in two manus@@ cri@@ pts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each wording being equally authentic .
whereas the agreement must be concluded in the form of a letter exchange to am@@ end Annex A of Protocol No. 1 to the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) - HA@@ T en@@ acts the following provisions :

agreement in the form of a letter exchange between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ sation of Member States &apos; demands in the medium @-@ term financial contribution
the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by loan agreements with central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks submit a corresponding application .
the agreement could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total limit of € 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds of the member countries .
however , some conditions are already mentioned below , to which the BI@@ S would be ready .
in each stand @-@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extension continu@@ ances without the fact that a total of five years would be exceeded .
at the opening of the credits as well as for their event@@ ual extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit @-@ opening fee .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first drawing dies were not made before the exp@@ iry of a month after the Stand@@ by agreement was concluded so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the drawing would take place in the currencies available to the BI@@ S at the conclusion of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend for periods of time taking into account the funds of the bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those applied by the BI@@ S at the time on under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S itself has to proc@@ ure the necessary funds on the market itself , the interest rate coming to the application could reach a maximum , corresponding to the Li@@ bor margin increased by a corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would like to share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by loan agreements with central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks submit a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would like to share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the form of correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb
I am referring to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community .
- fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat ( 0@@ 2.0@@ 1 A IV a ) ) ;

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olo@@ g on the antibody or any other substance on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) h@@ mol@@ y@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ tre is measured twice in a suitable medium by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be investigated .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the most powerful ser@@ um di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated excluding the volume of the blood cell flood in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on property carriers , the activity is expressed through time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carriage .
the World Health Organization has set up international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination International Standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are currently being elabor@@ ated .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of the re@@ agents for the blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ter , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ des in an er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te flood .
the ti@@ tre indicates the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mix in a series where micro@@ scop@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the International standard preparations ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown agent in comparison to the International standard preparation or a state standard preparation in international units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren contain according to definition 256 International units per ml .
preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory of Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparison of the International Standard ser@@ um Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should be maintained for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents indicated on the label is based on the results of the re@@ agents ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can enter .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0,5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ de at a pressure of no more than 0.0@@ 2 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvents delivered with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic if the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml liquid or recycled ser@@ um .
re@@ agents , regardless of whether in liquid form or after re @-@ dissolution , must be transparent and must not contain sedi@@ ments , gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents intended for international exchange for blood group identification should not be colored arti@@ fici@@ ally , at least until an international agreement has come about through a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such quantities and in such quantities that the re@@ agent located in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity contained in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and control of the re@@ agents for blood group determination .
adequate samples of all returned agents can be stored in the laboratory for a long time , until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for blood group determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary tools for strengthening the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective portion in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain any substances of human origin .
each container is a black on white printed label in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or , for dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid needed for the re@@ plen@@ ishment ,
in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the containers , contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
