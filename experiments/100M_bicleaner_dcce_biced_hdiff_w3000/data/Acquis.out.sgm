<seg id="723">C) twenty metric tons of depleted uranium with an enrichment of 0.05 (0.5%) or below;</seg>
<seg id="724">If liberated core material is to be processed or stored together with core material, which is subject to the safety measures under this Convention, precautions are taken for the re-application of the securing measures on that material.</seg>
<seg id="725">The Community meets with the Organization Supplementary agreements, which is necessary to the extent necessary for the successful and effective provision of the duties of the Organization under this Convention, in particular, as to the procedure laid down in the Convention.</seg>
<seg id="726">The supplementary agreements can be extended or amended without amendment of this Convention in agreement between the Organization and the Community.</seg>
<seg id="727">The supplementary agreements come into force at the same time or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention. the Organization, the Community and the States undertake all efforts to make these agreements come into effect within ninety days after the entry into force of this Convention; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization, the community and the states.</seg>
<seg id="728">Based on the initial report mentioned in article 62, the organization establishes a summary directory of the entire core material underlying the securing measures of this Convention, regardless of its origin, and carries out this inventory directory on the basis of the following reports and the results of its audit.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other hand</seg>
<seg id="730">The EWG has decided to contribute to the special action programme set out at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is hampered by general resource-related problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the aim of the EEC and Member States that the contribution made by Member States shall be bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible is spent within two years of entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">(D) The EEC and its organisation have consulted one another about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">To this end, the Organization of the EEC has presented a table from which it is clear in what way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization establishes a special account under the term "special actional account" which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the special transaction account; this account is managed by the organization as administrator and used (in this capacity, the organization is designated as "steward"), only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or ininterest notes issued by the member state, which must be paid upon request in the currency of the respective state to the order of the organisation as administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the organization of the organization in the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="737">(B) Payment shall be made in two installments, and the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. within 30 days of the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the caretaker agreed upon date;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the contribution of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or any other date agreed between the EEC and the Administrator, taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Each Member State may, upon request, make payments before the above mentioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the usual procedures of the organization, the administrator takes about proportionate drawing on the cash or the school junks to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account in a reasonable manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">Upon granting these loans, the caretaker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">(III) the extent in which international economic factors have contributed to the current and foreseeable economic problems of the country;</seg>
<seg id="743">(VI) the composition and the tendency of the country's debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without discount; and</seg>
<seg id="744">(VII) the extent to which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each special transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly refundable development programme or project (including a sectoral venture), irrespective of whether it is part of the organisation's loan programme or not, according to procedures and practices, which are considered, approved and administered for the ordinary funding of the organisation, with the aim of the bible to be taken into account in this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The means of the special transaction account must not be used instead of the Bank's Bank's Bank's Bank or Organisation instead of the Ordinary means, which are bound by a loan or loan in the context of a loan or loan, which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organisation on the date of the entry into force.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from Section 4, special repayment loans are subject to the same payment terms, which are generally applicable to the organization granted by the organization; they are therefore refundable at ten free years each in 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Bonds are granted in one or more currencies of Member States and are refundable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts for the payment of this bib must be paid directly to the organization that retains them.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each special bond loan must be rejected by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the caretaker, in particular the origin of the funds.</seg>
<seg id="751">Revenues from any special loan loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services manufactured or provided in a Member State; ii) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which, in accordance with what the caretaker has specified at the time of loan granted, may be a beneficiary of a special transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments from a special transaction loan are made on the special transaction account, and the amount refunded in this way in the currency of a Member State shall be transferred back as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">Until full payment of all special offers, the administrator will instruct the EEC on the plans and programmes approved by the directors to be reviewed by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of the payment of the special transaction loan, the administrator notifies the EEC four times a year on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">As soon as possible, the Administrator conveys a detailed billing of the special transaction account with a statement from the external auditor of the organization to this account statement as soon as possible after the business year of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special transaction loan, the administrator of the EEC will send a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and executes appropriate records and invoices from which the contributions to the special transaction account, the obligations to be financed from the account receipts and the amounts paid out of the account and the withdrawals made to the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretaker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the administrator until full edition of the means of the special transaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas on the status of the special transaction account, the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions and concerning all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978, or at a later date, which the EEC and the organization had to agree, the agreement and all obligations arising from it shall become invalid with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total capital amount of all special loans claimed by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and remitted to the Member States, this agreement and all obligations resulting from it will be terminated with immediate effect.</seg>
