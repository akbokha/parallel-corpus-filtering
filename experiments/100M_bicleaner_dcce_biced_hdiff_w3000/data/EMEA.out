this document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
for further information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melt tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. Un@@ cle thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • bi@@ polar I disorder , a mental disorder where patients have periods of abnormal mood alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and for the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for fast control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances if the oral ing@@ es@@ tion of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used to take or melt tablets in patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , as well as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted .
this imp@@ airs signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells among themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is believed to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partial ag@@ ony &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , is used to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ zophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents their recur@@ r@@ ence .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy , which can prevent the recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms , has been studied in three studies for up to a year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared with plac@@ ebo in two studies of 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ zophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased rest@@ lessness over a period of two hours .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence , compared to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , who suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , compared to that of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was examined by a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melt tablets and the solution to intake .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg had a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness than the patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively in four of the five short @-@ term studies than plac@@ ebo .
abili@@ fy also prevented the recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes with previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks , and in addition to an existing treatment was administered .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as lau@@ rel ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled ) , ret@@ initi@@ ation ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , ret@@ initi@@ ation ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , vom@@ iting , nausea , vom@@ iting ( increased s@@ ali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ zophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I dis@@ ruption and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients with predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes addressed the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were predomin@@ ant against the risks .
in addition , the board came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in case of rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schi@@ zophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance if oral therapy is not suitable to out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for the placing of A@@ bili@@ fy in the European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients with predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes responded to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ zophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proved .
considering the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results from an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ eri@@ ated and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy occur signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , consider reducing the dose or breaking the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be dismissed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions related to sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of dying compared to plac@@ ebo .
there was , however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored with respect to deteri@@ or@@ ating glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ zophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to comb@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as side effects , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally @-@ effective drugs with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % , while C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ aboli@@ zation , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive Met@@ aboli@@ zation .
considering the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ is@@ re@@ duc@@ tions should be made .
after sett@@ ling the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before the start of the accompanying treatment .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram , or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , together with A@@ bili@@ fy , can be expected with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the medi@@ ums of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the insufficient data base for the safety of humans and due to the concerns resulting from the reproduction studies of animals , this medicine may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk of the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on it .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side @-@ effects ( * ) :
the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ zophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a total reduced incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance - In a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase of over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
comparing the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo with potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
side effects that may occur in connection with anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy are the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , there is no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plas@@ map@@ le connection .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ zophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partially agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 @-@ recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a @-@ recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , on the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ name .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ zophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ dents &apos; response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale showed significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ zophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher return rate for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % in plac@@ ebo .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ zophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . ) .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a plac@@ ebo superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared with plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic tra@@ its , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed an efficacy comparable to plac@@ ebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also showed a similar proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ie , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , which in part did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term development phase over 74 weeks for man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed himself superior to plac@@ ebo in the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ tion of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic between male and female healthy subjects , and in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination schi@@ zophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a simulation @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the ethnic affili@@ ation or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy subjects .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated applications , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the can@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not identify any particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or ex@@ positions which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so that they only have limited or no significance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent non @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ mentation accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equals 3 to 10 times the moderate Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
in addition , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis has been determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans ( mg / m2 ) .
however , concentrations of the sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the bile of monkeys and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro solu@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to exposure of 3- and 11@@ x of the medium @-@ sized ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

15 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ zophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partially agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 @-@ recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a @-@ recept@@ ors .

patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing A@@ bili@@ fy tablets may take the melt tablets alternatively to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .

clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ zophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia because of comb@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ zophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partially agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 @-@ recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a @-@ recept@@ ors .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ zophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . ) .
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ic study over 3 weeks with fixed doses of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study comparing pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as a solution to intake 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ max medium of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
in addition , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans ( mg / m2 ) .

abili@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schi@@ zophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically attached , the treatment with the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be termin@@ ated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
in order to increase res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ise the vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended in circum@@ ference of obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicine already used for maintenance or ac@@ ut therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy melting tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution .
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with ag@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which have been caused by schi@@ zophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure drop ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution is not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ eri@@ ated and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored with respect to deteri@@ or@@ ating glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ zophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to comb@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared with the all@@ u@@ vial administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) was administered intra@@ muscular and at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ aboli@@ zation , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ is@@ re@@ duc@@ tions should be made .
after sett@@ ling the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before the start of the accompanying treatment .

the following adverse events were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solutions than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side @-@ effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side @-@ effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with plac@@ ebo .
in another 12 weeks study , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase for 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo treated patients .
comparing the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo with potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
side effects that may occur in connection with anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy are the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution with statisti@@ cally significantly greater improvements of ag@@ gi@@ ten@@ ess / behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances compared with plac@@ ebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ gi@@ ti@@ ousness and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms with regard to the toxic@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the lau@@ rel reference arm .
the mean improvement from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5,@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9,@@ 6 for lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe det@@ achment , a similar efficacy was observed with regard to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a reduced number of patients .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ zophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( or@@ ally ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ dents &apos; response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ zophren@@ ia , a significantly higher return rate was reported for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( or@@ ally ) , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in plac@@ ebo .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ zophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , an increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . ) .
111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , which in part did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed himself superior to plac@@ ebo in the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % larger than the AU@@ C after injection of the same dose as tablet in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration in a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which occurred between 15 and 5 times over the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity following intraven@@ ous application there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bit ) above the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety mac@@ rop@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , re@@ production toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the can@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not identify any particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or ex@@ positions which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; therefore , they only have limited or no significance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent non @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ mentation accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans and an increase of adren@@ al bar@@ k carcin@@ omas and combined adren@@ al bar@@ k @-@ aden@@ omas / carcin@@ omas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the average rate of the rate in humans ) .
in addition , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1- to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to exposure of 3- and 11 @-@ times of the medium steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters had previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side @-@ effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs .
considering only those who were treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between drug efficacy indicators such as time to wor@@ sen@@ ing of the disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
moreover , it must not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients in whom the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and that in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the distribution of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not shown ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ine count &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or a severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 , treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is achieved by Level 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function have been performed and there are currently no adequate data to endor@@ se dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bon@@ ded nan@@ op@@ article formulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again .
in the patients , no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ al number has increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the plat@@ el@@ et number is increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while equi@@ voc@@ ally with Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been proved in connection with cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , cardiac incidents in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if there is nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in the patients after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual methods of anti@@ em@@ ics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age who do not practice an effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is inevitable .
pregnant women should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not give birth to a child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised about a sperm conservation before the treatment , because the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very often ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) which can affect the traffic air@@ iness and the ability to operate machines .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events performed in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al Phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of the patients ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of the patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) in three cases .
in Table 1 , the side effects listed in conjunction with the addition of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at every dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .
occasionally , increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , hurt g@@ ums , loose stools , ec@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the lower abdom@@ en , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of the muscles , neck pain , gro@@ in pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in the skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , joint pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very frequently :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite related case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules substance that promotes the accumulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bul@@ ous tu@@ bing and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ posit@@ ory poly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ u@@ bul@@ ous network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in transm@@ its trans@@ y@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proved that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ um@@ re@@ zep@@ tor and a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation occurs in the area of the tumor due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( Ref@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ armed un@@ f@@ aded studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study .
in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion of 63 patients with m@@ amma carcin@@ oma over 30 minutes .
this multic@@ enter study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour intraven@@ ous pre@@ medication for preventing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % due to metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and for adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for overall response rate and time to disease progression as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are explained below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in relation to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to decay on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .

10 After the intraven@@ ous dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma at the recommended dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase way .
the medium distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or combination of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el following intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 were compared with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inal ex@@ cre@@ tion of the unchanged active substance was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , suggest@@ ing far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
over 75 years of age , only a few data are available , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .

member states must ensure that the holder of approval for placing on the market will provide medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials :
• Training brochure • summary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging examples . • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product , refriger@@ ated boxes for the transport through the patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels , in which complications may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion , if a self @-@ blood donation is not possible before the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is to be expected .
the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is displayed .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ bleeding end , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection may also be carried out by the patient or his supervis@@ or if they have received an appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or for patients receiving chemotherapy , the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ emia may be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was inserted that enables it to form epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa .
ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to the reference medical drug when administered as an injection into a v@@ ein as part of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein at least eight weeks before they were either switched to se@@ amed or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values between the start of the study and the assessment period between 25 and 29 weeks .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of ab@@ se@@ amed inj@@ ected under the skin were investigated with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values of patients treated to ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained to the same degree as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the bas@@ eline value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally cause symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , pi@@ erc@@ ing mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed , according to the provisions of the European Union , evidence was provided that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that manufactures ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages to healthcare professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG to appro@@ ve the placing of ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union .

a rise in the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values can be observed over or below the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration in one patient .

in patients with sudden loss of activity , defined as reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ value should be determined and the usual causes for a non @-@ contact ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminum toxic@@ ity , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) should be investigated .
if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ yte &quot; index &quot; ) , is low ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes and leu@@ k@@ oc@@ yte numbers are normal , and if no other reason for an effective loss is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n antibodies should be determined and a diagnosis of the bone mar@@ row for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA is considered .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
in clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the gift of epo@@ et@@ ins if the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased via the concentration required to control the symptoms of an@@ emia and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in should amount to about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of hyper@@ tension .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically @-@ evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion failure , the upper limit of the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is not yet to be di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in case of tumour patients with chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa and the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n response should be taken into account for the evaluation of the therapy efficiency of epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa ( patients who may have to be trans@@ founded ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ic an@@ a@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk weighing while taking part in the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients provided for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , before the beginning of epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients undergoing major elec@@ tive orthop@@ ae@@ dic@@ s should receive adequate thro@@ mbo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ tic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa for patients with an initial ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of post @-@ operative thro@@ mbo@@ tic / vascular events may exist .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ins have not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or to reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy when a ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was aimed
if epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dosis should be adapted to the rising ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ rit .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues there is no indication of an interaction between epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
thro@@ mbo@@ tic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular attacks , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm@@ s , retin@@ al@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n .
the most frequent side effect during treatment with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or wor@@ sen@@ ing of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n treatment , it may occur in patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ mbo@@ tic and vascular complications .
the genetic epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emia patients .
it could be shown by means of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa specifically stimulates the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and progression of tumour progression were examined in five large controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n and control patients .
in these studies , with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n were consistent with an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality compared to controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n and in case of controls .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
it is not clear how far these results are applied to re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the verified data .
epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa determin@@ ations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly longer half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa &apos;s ser@@ um levels are much lower than the ser@@ um levels achieved following intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ ul@@ fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ ul@@ ary fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa .

the owner of the marketing permit has to ensure that the pharmaceutical co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Version 3.0 and in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application is set up and functioning before the medicine is put into circulation and as long as the medicine applied to the traffic is used .
the holder of the approval for the placing on the market comm@@ its himself to carry out the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in the Pharmac@@ co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as well as in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. as well as any subsequent update of the Risk Management Plan accepted by the CH@@ MP .
according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Associ@@ ations for human use , &quot; an updated R@@ MP should simultaneously be provided with the next updated report on the safety of the medicine ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • in the event of receiving new information , which could have an impact on current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmaceutical co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan , or the risk reduction measures within 60 days after reaching an important ( pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction )
• If you suffer from a heart attack or stroke in one month before your treatment • If you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) , there is a risk of blood drop formation in the veins ( deep v@@ ein thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) - if you have occurred in earlier times such a blood pressure
patients with severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial vascular disease ) , the cervi@@ cal vessels ( vascular disease of the carb@@ oni@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed , it can occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of plat@@ el@@ ets , which re@@ stores after further treatment .
your doctor may regularly carry out regular blood tests to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets regularly during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
lack of iron , dissolution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or foli@@ c acid deficiency should be considered and treated with ab@@ se@@ amed before starting therapy .

if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ eria , it will ab@@ ort your treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated because of an@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value can be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death can be increased .
if you have elevated or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may consider an interruption of the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium values are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney weakness and clin@@ ically exposed cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion by inadequate heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of the an@@ a@@ emia with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not yet to be di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ es ( ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your sever@@ ed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( thro@@ mbo@@ tic occurrence ) .
this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully compared to the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if in the past already thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular events occurred ( e.g. a deep v@@ ein thro@@ mbo@@ sis or lung em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
if you are cancer patients , remember that ab@@ se@@ amed can act as a growth factor for blood cells and may under certain circumstances influence the tumour neg@@ atively .
if a major orthop@@ edic surgery is im@@ min@@ ent , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined before the start of treatment and treated accordingly .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get ab@@ se@@ amed as there is an increased risk of blood drop after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have used / used recently / used , even if they are non @-@ prescription pharmaceuticals .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may need to arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means of building the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia respon@@ ds to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may prescri@@ be regular blood tests to verify the success of treatment and ensure that the medicine works correctly and that your h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
as soon as you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice weekly , spread on two equally big inj@@ ections .

Ac@@ last@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a minor trau@@ matic frac@@ ture like the h@@ inf@@ ant ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy for inflammation ) shortly after the use of Ac@@ last@@ a can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of the Pa@@ get disease , Ac@@ last@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active substance in Ac@@ last@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ last@@ a .
the first study involved nearly 8@@ ,000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was investigated over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently had a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was investigated over a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a was tested in two studies with a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator for the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in the ser@@ um ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) norm@@ alized in the blood or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline value .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients with Ac@@ last@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis medication ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the plac@@ ebo patients .
patients taking Ac@@ last@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatments ) with those under Plac@@ ebo reduced the risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ last@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients in plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ last@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ last@@ a must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients in Ac@@ last@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney complaints , reactions to the in@@ fusion site and oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ last@@ a provides information for physicians who prescri@@ be Ac@@ last@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis that contains information on how to apply the medicine , as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to sell Ac@@ last@@ a to the entire European Union .

oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk for frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous 5 mg ac@@ last@@ a in@@ fusion is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a &apos;s in@@ fusion is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the disease Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Pa@@ get disease with Ac@@ last@@ a , a long re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , in accordance with twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ last@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days of the treatment of Ac@@ last@@ a can be reduced by adding par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended because there are limited clinical experience for this group of patients .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of elderly patients is similar to younger ones .
children and adolescents under 18 years of age are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , as data on safety and efficacy are lacking .
Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ a@@ emia is treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ c@@ emia may develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , in accordance with twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancers , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be considered a dental check with appropriate preventive dental treatment before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
no data is available for patients who need dental intervention , whether the interruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the treatment of Ac@@ last@@ a can be reduced by adding par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of suspected cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation reported in patients who received Ac@@ last@@ a increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to those receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the total frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ last@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid was associated with kidney dysfunction , which was associated with kidney function ( i.e. an increase in the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the changes in the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured every year before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a reduced kidney function were comparable in a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the application was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a compared to 0.8 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the assessment of the laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , performed at 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get trials .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions following the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0,@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area has been reported , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental procedures .
7 Study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in the jaw area of one with Ac@@ last@@ a and a patient treated with plac@@ ebo .
in case of over@@ dose which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ c@@ emia , a compensation of oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous calcium glu@@ con@@ ate in@@ fusion can be achieved .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The effectiveness and safety of ac@@ last@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been indicated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral body frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a decreased significantly over a period of three years and after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral body frac@@ tures ( see Table 2 ) .
patients aged 75 years and over had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a showed a constant effect over three years , which resulted in reduced risk for hip frac@@ tures at 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ last@@ a significantly increased bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ rate , hip and dist@@ al radius compared with plac@@ ebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.@@ 0 % , the lower angle by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology of 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ sies from the basin .
a micro@@ computer ( µ@@ TT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and the receipt of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture in patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a compared to plac@@ ebo .
bone turnover marker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pep@@ tide of type @-@ ion col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and the Beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study duration .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of ac@@ last@@ a significantly reduced B@@ SAP by 30 % after 12 months compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ last@@ a compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ last@@ a treatment increased BM@@ D compared to plac@@ ebo treatment at all times .
in comparison with plac@@ ebo treatment , the Ac@@ last@@ a treatment led to an increase of the BM@@ D by 5.4 % to total frac@@ tures and 4.3 % in the cervi@@ cal area .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in men treated with Ac@@ last@@ a compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the annual dose of Ac@@ last@@ a was not inferior to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the bas@@ eline value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment in the disease of the bone Ac@@ last@@ a was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , especially light to moder@@ ately difficult disease Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean ser@@ um levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponding to the 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid compared to the intake of 30 mg ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily for 2 months was proved in two six months comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain strength and loss of pain was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for Ac@@ last@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 patients with Ac@@ last@@ a and 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response of 141 of patients with Ac@@ last@@ a , compared with 71 of patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , was maintained at an average duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ off and multiple 5 and 15 minutes of persistent in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
then the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ phase dis@@ appearance from the big cycle with half @-@ life t ½ A 0,@@ 24 and t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long eli@@ min@@ ation phase with a terminal Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ s@@ wer@@ ts@@ zeit t ½ g 146 hours .
the early stages of distribution ( α and β with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption of the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion through the kidneys .
in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the total body clearing is 5,@@ 4 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the area under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearing of substances , which is metaboli@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 enzymes , is unlikely to be metaboli@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 enzymes and because it is a weak or no more direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolic dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
specific patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ atine in@@ in @-@ clearing , and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dysfunction down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min does not require any dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
as for severe kidney dysfunction ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ Latvian single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C ) were administered 6@@ times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al tolerance of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ric acid was administered in rats by taking doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulative ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects were observed in other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection site .
the most frequent infection with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ se of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages of 0,2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) de@@ formi@@ ties and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was 0,1 mg / kg as a result of low ser@@ um calcium levels .

Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease Pa@@ get of bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially o@@ est@@ rogen produced from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction takes place too fast , and new bone material is assembled un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ last@@ a works by norm@@ alizing the bone reconstruction , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus again giving strength to the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ last@@ a .
if you are using Ac@@ last@@ a with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you are taking other medicines or have used / used recently / used , even if they are non @-@ prescription pharmaceuticals .
it is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking drugs that are known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ last@@ a together with food and beverages , you are concerned that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you should take sufficient fluids before and after treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
if you have recently frac@@ tured the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
since Ac@@ last@@ a works for a long time , you may need a further dose after one year or more .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after the in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ last@@ a can work for more than a year , and your doctor will notify you if you need a new treatment .

if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to carry Ac@@ last@@ a &apos;s in@@ fusion of two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the treatment of Ac@@ last@@ a patients need to be supplied with sufficient fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atically @-@ running , hypo@@ c@@ emia may develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium , correspon@@ dingly at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , to ensure at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ last@@ a .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a .

the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects encountered in treatment in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in patients who have been treated for weight reduction and associated metabolic disorders .
if the incidence was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding plac@@ ebo rate ( for un@@ desirable effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for unwanted effects &lt; 1 % ) .
very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0.0@@ 1 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very early
in a retro@@ spective study , where a limited number of people were given a dose of up to 300 mg , only slight symptoms were observed .
patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and a simultaneous existing hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ d@@ mia .
weight reduction after one year amounted to 20 mg 6.5 kg , relative to bas@@ eline , versus 1.6 kg for the plac@@ ebo group ( difference - 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 3 ; -@@ 4,@@ 4 , p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) .

the percentage of patients reaching a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the difference between the mean weight changes between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group was 3.8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 0 , -@@ 2,@@ 6 p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) . LN
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to the direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n ei@@ m Ar@@ z
the steady state plasma levels were achieved after 13 days ( C@@ max = 196 ± 28.@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; C@@ rou@@ gh = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14,@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 26@@ 8 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml ) .

patients with black skin color can have an up to 31 % lower C@@ max and a 43 % lower AU@@ C than patients of other ethnic populations .
n popular pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analyses ( age range 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75@@ - year old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ max and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
5.3 Pre@@ clinical data for the safety of the following adverse effects that were not observed in clinical trials , but which occurred in animals after exposure in the human therapeutic area , were considered possibly relevant for clinical application :
in some , however , not in all cases , the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions seems to be associated with proced@@ ural stress such as dealing with animals .
if Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , no adverse effects were observed on fertility or cycle disorders .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behavior or memory .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public . this document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not indicated .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which cannot be sufficiently adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ p or insulin can be maintained with the on@@ set of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for those with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl alcohol or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , allowing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
this led to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were lowered in the application of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of an additional dose of acet@@ one for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin showed a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional dose of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin showed a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took plac@@ ebo in addition .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were vision disorders , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain , and hypo@@ esth@@ esia ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other ingredients , still in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high levels of ket@@ one level - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where Met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a licence to the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited Company for launching Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is in@@ appropriate for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under the age of 18 , so the use in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at risk of having at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain , and e@@ dem@@ a when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values must be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , super@@ structure complaints , ti@@ redness , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values must be checked .
the decision to continue the treatment of the patient with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be conducted before the clinical assessment of the laboratory parameters .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated , which can be caused by fat deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention .
a minor reduction of the mean ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) was followed as a result of a h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3.1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral dual or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or as dual combination therapy with insulin are the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , a decrease of visual acuity was reported under treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d indi@@ a , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , wor@@ sen@@ ing or wor@@ sen@@ ing of diab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking pic@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but prescri@@ bing doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients report on disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events with regard to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence amounted to 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patients ) compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to be pregnant or this occurs , the treatment should be dismissed ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or drug dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines which are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a decrease of the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ a@@ emia resulting from pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother &apos;s animal and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
very frequently &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( cannot be estimated from available data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T ass@@ umptions about three times the upper limit of the normal range often occurred as frequently as under plac@@ ebo , but less common than in comparison groups with met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins .
in an outcome study in patients with advanced macro@@ vascular disease , the incidence of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
since the market launch , it has rarely been reported about heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of reports of adverse events with regard to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients in patients treated with comparative medication was performed .
in the Pro@@ Active study , which ran over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms occurred .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome prolifer@@ ator activated rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which leads in the animal model to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose evaluation in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy continued over two years to study the time to get the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first six months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the on@@ set of therapy , blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar had been inadequate with insulin despite three months of optimization were random@@ ised to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo .
in patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diab@@ e@@ tics .
in most clinical studies , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol as well as slightly but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated LD@@ L cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced overall plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
compared to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas values reduced under met@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide were observed .
in a 20 @-@ week study , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ized to either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
according to oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is quickly absorbed , with the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to its effectiveness is roughly the triple of the efficacy of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
interaction studies have demonstrated that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or drug dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
according to oral use of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the wood ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma elimination time of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clearance of the mother &apos;s substance are similar .
toxic@@ ological studies were consistent with mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlar@@ ging with h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric cardiac hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e .
this is due to the fact that the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ a@@ emia resulting in the gest@@ ation and increases the insulin resistance of the mother &apos;s animal and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the bladder epitheli@@ um were induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d indi@@ ions led to increased frequency of col@@ on tum@@ ours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence amounted to 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patients ) compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide were investigated .
in clinical trials over 1 year , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline values .
in a 20 @-@ week study , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , which has an effect on Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic lac@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study failed to determine its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ killing m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are not associated with the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 45 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events with regard to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients receiving comparative medication , an increased incidence of bone frac@@ tures in women was demonstrated .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is usually applied once or twice daily if a rapid initial effect along with a longer lasting effect is desired .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were lowered similarly to another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to in@@ insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , doses of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( see the complete list of packages ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes out@@ weigh the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the distribution of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane across the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily if a rapid initial effect along with a longer lasting effect is desired .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar levels have improved dramatically , for example , by intensified insulin therapy , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms can be altered and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( producer ) , type of insulin ( fast acting , bi@@ phase , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or method of production ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA over insulin of animal origin ) can cause a change in the dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the adjustment .
some patients reported hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines they have taken .
4 S@@ low hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which may occur in a not sufficiently controlled diab@@ etic therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Ac@@ tually - Periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement in blood sugar control can be associated with discomfort referred to as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .
5 An intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar setting can , however , be associated with a temporary wor@@ sen@@ ing of diab@@ etic retin@@ opathy .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy At the injection site , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy may arise if it has been fo@@ amed to change the deposits within the injection area .
general conditions and complaints at the place of delivery - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reaction at the injection site Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma can occur at the injection site ) .
diseases of the immune system Ac@@ tually - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized rash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gastro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ on@@ euro@@ sis , breathing difficulties , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and power@@ lessness / un@@ consciousness .
hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia may develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diab@@ e@@ tics should always have glucose , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven auxiliary person or by glucose given by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the effective maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration of the work is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of split ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were taken into consideration ; none of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites formed by the split are active .
based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated applications , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and the reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans .
it is recommended - after the Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane screw bottle has been removed from the refrigerator - to get the temperature of the insulin at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it is res@@ us@@ pen@@ ded according to the manual for the first use .
some patients reported hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .

the termin@@ ale half @-@ life time ( t ½ ) is therefore rather a measure of res@@ or@@ ption as a measure of the elimination per se of insulin from the plasma ( insulin has a t ½ of a few minutes in the blood@@ stream ) .

this document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
the pharmac@@ eu@@ tically active ingredient in Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced with the method of the so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology &quot; :

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued an approval to the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S company for launching Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id throughout the European Union .
if two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin which is fast acting must first be raised , then the amount of insulin which is long acting .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when the patient is changed to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the adjustment .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .
5 General diseases and complaints at the place of delivery Ac@@ tually - local hyper@@ sensitivity reaction to the injection site Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma can occur at the injection site ) .
diab@@ e@@ tics should always have glucose , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven auxiliary person or by glucose given by the doctor .
clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diab@@ etic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diab@@ etic patients who underwent major surgical procedures ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the effective maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration of the work is about 7 to 8 hours .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was investigated in a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diab@@ etic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited but suggests that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to adults .
in@@ fusion systems with concentrations of 0.0@@ 5 I.@@ U. / ml - 1,0 I.@@ U. / ml Insul@@ in human in in@@ fusion fluids 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % D- glucose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l potassium chlori@@ de are stable at room temperature for 24 hours at room temperature .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients already showing signs of cryst@@ alli@@ sation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or lymp@@ h nodes ( &quot; stones &quot; ) that can lead to joint and bone damage .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still above 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first months of treatment , g@@ out attacks can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients continue to use other medicines for the prevention of rheum@@ atism at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ o@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ o@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( plac@@ ebo ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug used to treat hyper@@ ur@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once received 120 mg once daily , had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in the case of diseases that have already led to ur@@ ate deposits ( including a g@@ out node known from the medical history and / or g@@ out arthritis ) .
if the ser@@ um acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into account on the AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents , since there is no experience in children and adolescents , is not recommended to use f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients .
since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular diseases In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or chronic heart failure , the treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other resin @-@ based medicines , an acute attack can occur during the course of treatment , because it is possible to mobili@@ ze ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue by lowering the ser@@ um acid level .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment ( Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han &apos;s syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so far that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical trials , slight con@@ spic@@ u@@ ities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before the start of the f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ otherapy treatment and in the course of further development ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ ine was not performed any interaction studies to F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( a hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects the simultaneous administration of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ exposition ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ ine or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient applied at the same time .
in a study with subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily showed an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ atum , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid , the magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the intake of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and causes a decrease of the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ an@@ cies do not cause side effects of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at to the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .

a numerical higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the total f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ory group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extensions ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors determined by these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) side effects , which could be present in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which have been reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are simultaneously treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies , severe skin ras@@ hes or serious hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
in the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients for up to 2 years , 57 patients for up to 3 years and 53 patients with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg treated for up to 4 years .
the related events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :

clinical trial results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point in each study was the proportion of patients with the last three monthly ser@@ um levels &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) or Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um incre@@ ment value at the start of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the conven@@ tionally used dose of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of the ser@@ um acid level to &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and maintained permanently throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x a day ; 10 patients with ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x a day .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( ie ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage reg@@ ression of the ser@@ um resin concentrations in subjects , despite their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um resin concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the ser@@ um acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of rheum@@ atism , so that less than 3 % of patients required treatment against a g@@ out in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against a g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction of the g@@ out node size , which resulted in a complete dis@@ appearance of the lymp@@ h nodes up to 24 % in 54 % of the patients .
elevated TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased propor@@ tionally from 10 mg to 120 mg dose dose after administration .
for doses of between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in the AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at which is larger than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day , the C@@ max is 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage drop in the ser@@ um acid concentration provided this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent loss @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding of alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

after intake of an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ edly F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found to be un@@ modified fo@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 30 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair was found as un@@ altered bas@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , acet@@ yl@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gates ( 25 % ) and as yet unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups kidney failure After intake of multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal ren@@ al function .
the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by approximately 1.8 times of 7.5 m g / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function at 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 liver function restriction After intake multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ - Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) Li@@ ver restriction did not significantly change the C@@ max and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes in the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase in ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ors ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with x@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , with approximately 11 times the exposure to humans .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ atory metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical application .
it has been found that f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats .
at high doses , which were about 3 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , accompanied by a reduction of the increase in expenditure and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats .
Ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying cases with ex@@ positions , approximately 4,@@ 3 times and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which amounted to about 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , did not result in ter@@ ato@@ genic effects .

an updated R@@ MP must be presented in accordance with the CH@@ MP guidelines on risk management systems for human medicines with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • if new information exists which has an impact on the safety data , the pharmaceutical co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk minim@@ ization activities • within 60 days of reaching important mil@@ estones ( pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) • on request of the E@@ MEA
in some people , the ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations which are so high that ur@@ ic acid becomes in@@ soluble .
if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration down by the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the crystal formation is prevented and in this way a reduction of the discomfort is achieved .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other components of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
tell your doctor before you start taking this medicine , • if you have a heart weakness or have or suffer from any other heart problem . • if you are treated because of a high ur@@ ic acid concentration in a result of cancer or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ( a rare in@@ born condition in which too much ur@@ ic acid is found in the blood ) .
if you have a g@@ out attack at the moment ( sudden appearance of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , feeling of warmth and joint swelling ) , wait until the attack is cleared before starting with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC treatment .
this does not have to be the case with everyone , but may also occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months , if you take AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines if necessary to prevent a g@@ out or to treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint swelling ) .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have used / used recently / used , even if they are non @-@ prescription pharmaceuticals .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a condition in which the bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of a low vitamin D level .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines approved in the European Union , the company presented data origin@@ ating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing the vitamin D level .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in the patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was less ( 11 % ) than those who only received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose required to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , es@@ oph@@ agus , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ( swal@@ lowing ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ( infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ) as well as aci@@ dic impact .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 , or any of the other ingredients .
it must not be used for es@@ oph@@ agus diseases , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or for patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
Janu@@ ary@@ 2007 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd. for the placing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow the instructions below to reduce the risk of sho@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• At the end of the day AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or melt the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B . pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal ble@@ edings or surgical interventions in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al responses , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and the patients should be advised to stop the medicine at the occurrence of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ viral pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 . the risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue to take it after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
whereas in large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a ( after market introduction ) were rarely reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw usually associated with tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men mainly intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available which indicate whether or not the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw is reduced if a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate treatment in patients who need a lower surgical intervention .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is author@@ itative for the therapeutic planning of each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the pill the next morning after taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their om@@ is@@ sion .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but keep taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the intended day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before starting therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions occurring .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is not to be applied either during pregnancy or by breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate leave no indication of directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports come from cancer patients , but also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , the ser@@ um cal@@ ci@@ um decreased to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and ser@@ um phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate following an oral over@@ dose may cause hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , e@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

in the group treated with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a reduction of 48 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % versus plac@@ ebo 6.2 % ) compared with plac@@ ebo was achieved in the proportion of patients suffered by one or more verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to stop ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was also maintained .
fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo controlled studies where al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily , either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new spinal frac@@ ture by 47 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption referred to an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0,@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ gh@@ tly fasting and two hours before a standardised breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers , the application of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) led to no clin@@ ically meaningful change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats showed that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in tissue tissues after IV administration of 1 mg / kg , but is then quickly re@@ distributed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
after IV dose of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radio@@ actively selected substance was eliminated within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the rot@@ ting .
following an intraven@@ ous dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearing of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 71 ml / min and systemic Clear@@ ance did not exceed 200 ml / min .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted through the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems .

ex@@ cre@@ tion The mean de@@ position of radio@@ activity in healthy subjects was the mean de@@ position of radio@@ activity in urine after 48 hours 2.4 % , in the rate after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is ex@@ cre@@ ted quickly via urine .
although no clinical data is available , the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal tests is also reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients who have transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already being used in the EU , the company has submitted the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplantation , and the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , by examining how often a new organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter further studies were conducted on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including hypo@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or regime should only be performed under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a consequence of switching to an alternative formulation , therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level provisions ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ mirrors should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
on day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a level mirror , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dor@@ sal levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearance , an adjustment of the advance dose can take several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the condition of the patient does not allow oral consumption of medicines in the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of the application to supp@@ ress the transplan@@ t rejection must be maintained by immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
other dosage adjustments may be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after transplantation .
dose recommendations - liver transplantation pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
dosage recommendation - switch from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must have a transplan@@ t receiver of twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to be converted to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , so this conversion has to take place in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the total daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ ts After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment must begin with the oral initi@@ als recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ ts for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ t in adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ f is an oral initi@@ al dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day to be taken once daily in the morning .
although there are no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in lung , p@@ ank@@ reas@@ - and bow@@ el transplan@@ ted patients , patients in lung transplan@@ t transplan@@ ted patients were treated at an oral initi@@ al dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and for intestinal transplan@@ t recipients at an oral initi@@ al dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood levels in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver dysfunction .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um cre@@ atine level , a calculation of the cre@@ atine in@@ in duct and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
switch from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy caution is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerance in an individual case taking the aid of whole blood Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ spiegel controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent control of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dor@@ sal levels during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , Dos@@ age adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while using substances that could alter the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments to the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred .
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dor@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in whole blood are usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in case of kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were generally used during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients .
this has resulted in serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under or over @-@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or regime should only be performed under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 There are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f for the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which has proven to be a therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants .
there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f to prevent transplan@@ t rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and gra@@ ft recipients in childhood .
due to possible interactions , which may lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus &apos;s blood and weak@@ ening the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , taking herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant remedies during a treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations .
in rare cases , a corneal or sep@@ tum hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e described as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or ultra@@ violet light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin l@@ esi@@ ons due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun@@ screen with a high protection factor .
if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , cra@@ mps and visual disturbances , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f Hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose contain , special caution is required in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels combined with simultaneous administration of substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
strong interaction with an@@ tim@@ y@@ co@@ tics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ol as well as the Macro@@ eyel@@ id antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors ( z )
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .

tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus effect on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can imp@@ air their metabolism .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thereby increase the exposure of hormones , it is particularly appropriate to act cau@@ ti@@ ously in decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus potentially l@@ essen the pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one &apos;s Clear@@ ance and prolon@@ gs its half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of studies on transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that in tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( in particular with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ alkal@@ ine of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effects profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants can often not be determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a multitude of other medicines .
the side effects are listed in descending order following their frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data is not estimated ) .

action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On a molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are medi@@ ated through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ olic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cellular interior .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a specific number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ kin genes .

lung transplantation in an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multic@@ enter study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported to over 110 patients receiving either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ation syndrome , was less frequent in the first year after the transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.3 % ) .
the survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus it came in 2@@ 1,7 % of the cases for the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans in comparison to 3@@ 8.0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.0@@ 2 ) than the number of patients who were converted from tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was higher after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the lung transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syndrome in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly lower .
a multic@@ enter study of oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed on 205 patients undergoing pancre@@ as and kidney transplantation , who received tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) random@@ ized procedure .
the oral initi@@ als dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to reach the desired level of water from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant following intestinal transplan@@ ts showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ cer@@ al transplantation ) .

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ rit and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism induced by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplantation .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion takes place mainly through the bile .
the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f in stable patients treated by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice a day ) to Adv@@ agra@@ f ( mg : mg ) in relation to the total daily dose .

advoc@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Adv@@ ate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor of VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced using a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) is inserted that enables it to form the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the use of the drug for preventing bleeding and surgical procedures was examined .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study the efficacy of Adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ is@@ odes was awarded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a licence to the Ba@@ x@@ ter AG company for placing Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , the location and the degree of bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
in the case of the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity should not drop below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
repeat injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the danger for the patient is over .
in the course of treatment , appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma level is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of the inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , perform various in vivo recovery and have different half @-@ life times .
3 Pre@@ vention for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg of body weight at intervals of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if the hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge is not controlled with an adequate dose , a test must be performed in order to detect an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered .
the rate of administration should depend on the patient &apos;s condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II directed Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma via modified Beth@@ es@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure stage is the largest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ ors development , a re@@ combin@@ ant factor of VI@@ II product was observed after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II to another , the re@@ emergence of ( low @-@ ti@@ dy ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors of factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of which occurred in previously untreated patients with higher risk of forming inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 to &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in one patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the plasma as well as the clearing rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th day of the postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after prior exposure to factor VI@@ II concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) found a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or .
previously untreated patients from an ongoing clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated patients with inhibit@@ ors of factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as an en@@ during peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicated on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hili@@ c gran@@ u@@ lo@@ ytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reported about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ id reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated factor VI@@ II appears as a factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X by factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( base value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters are derived from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 100 previously treated patients , or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

based on the data available since the initial authorisation , the CH@@ MP continues to evaluate the benefits risk weighing as positive , but considering that the safety profile needs to be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which necess@@ it@@ ates a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , the CH@@ MP decided to apply for further extension procedures in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited granted the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company withdraw@@ s its application for approval for the in@@ placing of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
usually , however , breast , brain , bone or soft tissue ( tissues that connect and support other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been modified to produce no copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 @-@ protein again .
the p@@ 53 @-@ protein , which is formed from the non @-@ defective gene in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , where the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is defective , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can grow further and divide .
the company presented data from a study with a patient who joined the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the abdominal area , the bones and the brain .
after the CH@@ MP checked the company &apos;s responses to the questions he asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the review of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP will create a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 .
the CH@@ MP opinion has not been sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in &apos;s injection in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors brings benefits to patients .
the Committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
moreover , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be established in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not know whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modified ingredient release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other is slowly released over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al passages caused by an allergy to p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents 12 years old , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet , which should be taken with or without food with a glass of water .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are sounded .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed with a standard scale how severe the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients reported that the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze decreased by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under Aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients receiving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ asing ) , oral dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c substances or lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must also not be used in patients suffering from a narrow angle glaucoma ( hyper@@ tension ) , heart or vascular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ emia ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ tis ) , or a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ aging stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a licence to the Company SP Europe for launching Aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze on the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking , crus@@ hing or ch@@ ewing ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under the age of 12 due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have disappeared .
it is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days , as long @-@ term application can reduce the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after a decrease in the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory passages , the treatment can be continued with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , li@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , which can be performed or@@ ally or nas@@ ally as an abnormal r@@ hin@@ ologic agent ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient population and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate recommendations for dosage .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients need to be informed that the treatment must be stopped in case of hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or head@@ aches ) .
patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • patients with m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions .
in the context of clinical trials with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test showed no significant differences between those treated with lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo regardless of whether or not a lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vivo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to drow@@ sin@@ ess which may lead to impair@@ ment of traffic air@@ ti@@ ghtness or the ability to operate machines .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mol@@ or , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ter@@ ings .
head@@ aches , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscular weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ al pain , ver@@ tig@@ o , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ illary di@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the hibition of expression of the adhesion molecule P @-@ Selec@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S exc@@ itation .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years took part in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher compared to the overall stand@@ by for the symptoms ( except for nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ) , significantly higher than under mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to patient sub @-@ groups according to sex , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
in the course of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable in plasma within 30 minutes after administration .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the body weight of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
within the scope of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poorly metaboli@@ zed .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the u@@ bi@@ quit@@ ous application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was for exposure after administration of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ rop@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated applications , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular danger to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ological studies the combination of lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral dosage of rats at a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and to rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

after the launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , very rarely reported cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin ras@@ hes .
cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disturbances , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of inflammation of the liver and cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver values has also been reported very rarely .
it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 mg / ly@@ op@@ hili@@ a for intake ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 m@@ g. melt tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake .
for children between one and five years , the dose amounts to 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is expressed in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup .
for children between six and eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving approximately 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four trials of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who also had asthma ) .
efficacy was measured by identifying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ran@@ g@@ les , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to demonstrate that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution for the intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom ( number of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
in both studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria the decrease of the symptom scores after six weeks was treated with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company SP Europe for the launching of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies to the efficacy of young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the clinical course of the disease and may be termin@@ ated after the symptoms have disappeared .
in case of persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient may be recommended during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol , the performance reduction effect of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to drow@@ sin@@ ess which may lead to impair@@ ment of traffic air@@ ti@@ ghtness or the ability to operate machines .
in clinical trials , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most common adverse events reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with cas@@ ebo and 6.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesion molecule P @-@ Selec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses in which the patient was administered daily for 14 days in a dose of up to 20 mg daily .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( which is nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be divided in dependence on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the overall core of the questionnaire for quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was studied for further forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , regardless of the eti@@ ology of the different forms , is similar and chronic patients can easily be recru@@ ited pro@@ spec@@ tively .
as hist@@ amine release is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that in addition to chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , in other forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the symptoms are improved ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the study was excluded from the study by the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines .
an improvement in the it@@ ching rate by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study in which the patient demo@@ s were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of the patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely ruled out .
in vivo , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ rop@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated applications , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular danger to humans .

eri@@ us can be taken separately from meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of age are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and there are no data available that support a treatment of an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical ab@@ norm@@ alities , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are metaboli@@ zed with lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience a higher endurance load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children aged between 2 and 11 , which is fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who metaboli@@ se normal .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the performance reduction effect of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose reported 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
children aged between 1 and 11 years of age who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily average dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used daily for 14 days in a dose of up to 20 mg , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( which is nine times the clinical dose ) applied for ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
at a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials led to no impair@@ ment of psych@@ om@@ ot@@ oric .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not cause an increase in alcohol induced performance impair@@ ment or increase of drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the overall core of the questionnaire to quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the rh@@ initi@@ s caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the circulation of this restric@@ tive phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children aged between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations bigger with bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sia ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are fully metaboli@@ zed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max is about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active substance cum@@ ulation after daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C and C@@ max values of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were comparable to pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients in the recommended doses compared to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III @-@ Bra@@ ung@@ las@@ bottles with child@@ proof polypropylene @-@ cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
equipped with a rigid , transparent polystyrene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application sy@@ ringe for preparations for accepting with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( just for the 150 ml bottle ) .
a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ a once daily put in the mouth to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
immediately prior to application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ats is taken for intake without damaging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally used ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , in which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were applied , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ z@@ sat was well tolerated in two single dose studies ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( which is nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the overall core of the questionnaire for quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

add an A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melt tablet once a day to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melting tablets once daily put in the mouth to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies to the efficacy of young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately prior to application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and taken from the dose of the tablet without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years of age have not been proven .
the overall frequency of side effects between the susp@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the plac@@ ebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile specified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet proved to be the bio@@ equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ a for the engaging formulation of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this poorly metaboli@@ zed phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ at@@ ric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and in black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) greater than in Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( adults 2 % , children 3 % ) , however , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ a , the form@@ ulations were bio @-@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients , but in combination with dose @-@ finding studies in children , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage for children from 6 to 11 years .
food has no significant influence on AU@@ C and C@@ max from A@@ eri@@ us A@@ eri@@ us A@@ eri@@ us ly@@ op@@ hili@@ a , while food T@@ max of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n extends from 2.5 to 4 hours and T@@ max of 3 @-@ O@@ H@@ - Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n from 4 to 6 hours .

the safety of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children aged between 2 and 11 , which is fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who metaboli@@ se normal .
this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ Is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
in infants aged between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported in plac@@ ebo were diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study , no adverse events were observed in patients between the ages of 6 and 11 at a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the inf@@ ant and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be depending on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and

since A@@ eri@@ us solution contains the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no organic equivalent study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to sy@@ rup and tablets .
in different single dose studies , AU@@ C and C@@ max values of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were comparable to pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients in the recommended doses compared to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially approved the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company withdraw@@ s its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov on the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that is intended to protect from a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to person , because humans have not yet built up immunity ( no protection ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the immune system is later able to produce antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as a foreign body ) , was cleaned up and used as a component of the vaccine .
an inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine did not suff@@ ice to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .
for further information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who are unable to swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ s@@ avi@@ r , as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
it should only be as@@ cer@@ tained once the doctor has checked what an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines the patient has previously taken and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of the virus to be addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100@@ mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of adren@@ alin depends on body weight .
aging in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
aids cannot cure AIDS , but can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of HIV @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , but without k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in 20@@ 6 adults who had previously taken prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ence , the medicine used with low @-@ dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with un@@ documented levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than plac@@ ebo after 48 weeks , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gen@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors had only very few responded to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the use of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , it combined with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger drop in the viral load after four weeks as in the patients receiving their former prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ently :
the most common side effects of A@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , nausea , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
it may also not be used in patients who use St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are degra@@ ded as well as ag@@ re@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who are taking a@@ general are the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ juven@@ ating immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ag@@ re@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years were predomin@@ ant in comparison with the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ s@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefits of ag@@ re@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously had not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for placing as@@ re@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ previously treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
generally , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are supposed to be administered for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic booster of am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take account of the individual viral resistance pattern and the patient &apos;s pre @-@ treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than the capsule ; therefore , ag@@ re@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of ag@@ re@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a day @-@ to @-@ day dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
a@@ general is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be carried out with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent the medi@@ ums of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ is@@ other@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that it may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with a@@ gen@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
generally , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences .
for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivi@@ ral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including chronic hepatitis indicate an increased incidence of liver dysfunction in anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of ag@@ re@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ tic@@ ost@@ ero@@ id effects including Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of ast@@ atin with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( controlled by the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
in patients who use these drugs at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective due to the reduced plasma level of am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , patients should be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under the age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
aging should be set to 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an exac@@ er@@ bation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases that were needed to treat medications associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in the case of hem@@ mop@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ sis occur .
in HIV infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi @-@ fac@@ torial eth@@ ology is assumed ( including cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol intake , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis cases were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrates with low therapeutic width are not allowed at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent the medi@@ ums of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ is@@ other@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are metaboli@@ zed predominantly via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
in the attempt to compensate the lower plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , un@@ desirable effects on the liver were observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already receives St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ ble@@ virus mirrors and , if possible , check the viral load and susp@@ end the St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when Nel@@ spru@@ avi@@ r is administered with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max on the other hand reduced by 30 % if k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r have been applied twice daily and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % lower if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice a day ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but close monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
there has been no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study on the use of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ al component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see ant@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) , dosage adjustment is not required .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and available limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may lower the ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used at the same time , caution is advisable as Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these medicines are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out , as precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ ine is difficult .
the simultaneous addition of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus to an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data available for this .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to the 2.@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value observed once daily with no simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including medi@@ ums , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may also interact with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly causing interactions .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with ag@@ re@@ ase .
based on data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as a@@ general , as it can cause res@@ or@@ ption problems .
the simultaneous application of anti @-@ conv@@ ul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma level of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
ser@@ um levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by means of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine .
the simultaneous intake of ather@@ os@@ clerosis can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma level increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous addition of A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is highly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in the plasma level can be expected with simultaneous administration of ather@@ os@@ clerosis .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these pharmaceuticals is not recommended with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirror is recommended since the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous administration of am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used together with oral mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while the use of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is advisable .
data on the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered along with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the inher@@ ently low reliability of historic compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given at the moment , such as the amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r dose if am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r is administered with meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time .
in combination with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with ag@@ re@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of atten@@ uation or ampli@@ fication of anti@@ thro@@ mbo@@ tic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional dose of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ min and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous administration of a@@ gen@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother when compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , but it is not known if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the intru@@ sion into the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding period , showed a reduced increase in the 12 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
further development of the seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother &apos;s animal .
the harm@@ lessness of a@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most adverse events associated with the A@@ gen@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely led to treatment .
for many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine applied to the HIV treatment , or if they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of a@@ gen@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) assessed by investig@@ ators as in connection with study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as any changes in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fet@@ al sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation ( stit@@ ching ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ ally not pre @-@ treated people who had been treated with am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine for a medi@@ an duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( stit@@ ching ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients with in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a medi@@ an duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) .
ras@@ hes usually were mild to moder@@ ately pronounced , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ u@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r had to be stopped .
oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
at the time of initi@@ ation of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV infected patients with severe immune defect may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients receiving 600 mg of adren@@ alin twice a day together with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable to those who received high doses of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and CP@@ K values in patients who received ag@@ gener@@ ase together with low @-@ dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient can observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .

the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r in vitro versus HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans has not yet been defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ s@@ avi@@ r B@@ oo@@ st@@ inated Treatment Sc@@ as with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates being gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 en@@ capsul@@ ated patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , G@@ 48@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , Q@@ 58@@ E , D@@ 60@@ E , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) patients treated with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors performed in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
analysis systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ s@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors resistant insul@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ s@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / M , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M combined with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to fossil avi@@ r and a reduced lik@@ el@@ ihood of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for analy@@ zing the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for ass@@ essing the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ s@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors resistant insul@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four genetic patterns associated with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remain in general .
there are currently data about cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ at@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) appear .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early termination of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which with PI pre@@ treated adult after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ kle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly used with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven sensitivity to A@@ gen@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in response to the time @-@ adjusted mean change from bas@@ eline ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ level threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of Un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ tem A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV infected children between 2 and 18 years of age , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies , ag@@ re@@ ase solution for taking and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22@@ ,5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low @-@ dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients previously treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of patients en@@ rolled in the study had a plasma HIV 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bir@@ sted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ gen@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral dosing , the average duration ( T@@ max ) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max on the other hand reduced by 30 % if k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) was unaffected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be locked into the tissue by a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of the blood stream into the tissues .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , is likely to remain unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval depending on the overall drug concentration in the steady state over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or present a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrate should be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with a@@ gen@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the addition of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily pre @-@ explosion @-@ exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase Solution and A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ s@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of kidney dysfunction may be low on the elimination of am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these regi@@ mens show Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained from healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous oral treatment of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ genic aden@@ omas in male animals occurred in dos@@ ages , corresponding to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of the exposure on humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications , showed little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vitro and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation test ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proved in a clinical routine by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
so far , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of a@@ gen@@ ase or after the end of the treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated with age of 4 days showed a high mortality both in the control animals and the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure in humans , were observed , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus prolon@@ gation and minor skel@@ etal changes that indicate delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of ag@@ re@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a day @-@ to @-@ day dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be carried out with caution in patients with weak or mild cases of liver function , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , and war@@ far@@ in ( controlled by the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
aging should be set to 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug dependent factors such as a prolonged anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max on the other hand reduced by 30 % if k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but close monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
if these medicines are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out , as precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ ine is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose is 31 , although there are no clinical data available for this purpose .
ser@@ um levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by amp@@ on@@ hole , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine .
in a clinical study , in which k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma level increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
in combination with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with ag@@ re@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of atten@@ uation or ampli@@ fication of anti@@ thro@@ mbo@@ tic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % , respectively .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother when compared to the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the intru@@ sion into the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in weight during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of a@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient can observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r in vitro versus HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , the benefits of &quot; un@@ b@@ oo@@ ster@@ ly &quot; a@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval depending on the overall drug concentration in the steady state over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or present a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrate should be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with a@@ gen@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ s@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of kidney dysfunction should be low on the elimination of am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas in male animals occurred in dos@@ ages which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of the exposure on humans after twice daily administration of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ zel@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there is little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vitro and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation test ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test for rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated with age of 4 days showed a high mortality both in the control animals and the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in juven@@ ile the metabolism paths are not yet fully developed , so that Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) are .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution to intake is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ previously treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
the benefit of using k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; B@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution was neither shown in patients treated with PI nor with PI previously treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than the capsule ; therefore , ag@@ re@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should , once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution to take away ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a day @-@ to @-@ day dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since there is no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of as@@ re@@ ase solution to intake and low @-@ dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although dose adjustment for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of a@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with ren@@ al failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a consequence of the high propylene gly@@ col content , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous oral administration may result in a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these medicines and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects like heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that it will continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with a@@ gen@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
some medicines that cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( controlled by the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) are available to determine the drug concentration .
ag@@ re@@ ase should be stopped for a long time if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug 49 dependent factors such as a prolonged anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders .
in the case of hem@@ mop@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ sis occur .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max on the other hand reduced by 30 % if k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous intake with a@@ general can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and result in P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am &apos;s significant plasma concentrations are expected based on the oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is unknown . due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us , A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution to intake may not be applied to the included propylene gly@@ col during pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .
amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , but it is not known if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the intru@@ sion into the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in the 55 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of a@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
for many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine applied to the HIV treatment , or if they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ s@@ avi@@ r B@@ oo@@ st@@ inated Treatment Sc@@ as with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
early departure of a failing 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bir@@ sted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ gen@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure in humans , were observed , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus prolon@@ gation and minor skel@@ etal changes that indicate delayed development .

the application frequency and duration of treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • Al@@ dar@@ a must be applied three times a week for six weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream can be applied five times a week during one or two four weeks of treatment , with four weeks of pause between treatment cycles .
before bed@@ time , the cream is dil@@ uted to the affected areas of the skin , so that it stays on the skin for long ( about eight hours ) before being washed away .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which patients were treated for six weeks and al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo applied either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ial ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . the total treatment rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with al@@ dar@@ a , but only 3 % to 18 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p of immun@@ o@@ competent adults if the size or number of l@@ esi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of a cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
apply Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is continued until all visible cow@@ ards have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ an@@ al area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an interruption in the treatment course described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only in@@ completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan .
apply i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and rub in the puri@@ fied , infected skin area until the cream is fully absorbed .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take place in these patients between the benefits of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host@@ - reaction .
in other studies where no daily Vor@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with one to circumcision leading Stri@@ k@@ tur were observed .
in an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have been observed , which made a treatment necessary and / or resulted in a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following treatment with other cut@@ aneous inj@@ ected means for the treatment of external fo@@ ol@@ es in the genital and peri@@ an@@ al region have not yet been clinical experiences .
while limited data suggest an increased rate of return reductions in HIV positive patients , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown less effectiveness in this group of patients with regard to the removal of the cow@@ ard war@@ ts .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips or the hair@@ line was not examined .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases generally during therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin around 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there is currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates available for more than 36 months after the treatment , other appropriate therapy forms should be considered in super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
there are no clinical experiences in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , so the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower chance of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip @-@ dawn .
very limited data are available on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ial ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical areas outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ial ker@@ ato@@ sis on the under@@ arms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually take effect in the course of therapy or go back after the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for several days .
from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 active l@@ esi@@ ons showed a lower total cure rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although the level of ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) quanti@@ fiable after several times has been achieved , no recommendation can be given to the application during the lac@@ tation period .
the most commonly reported and prob@@ able or possibly related adverse events in the studies of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in the trials with three @-@ week treatment were local reactions at the location of the treatment of the patients ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most commonly reported and prob@@ able or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include complaints at the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the 185 patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical study reported side effects are shown below .
the most common , prob@@ able or possibly related side effect of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream application was a response to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
adverse events reported by 25@@ 2 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream are listed below .
this clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , it frequently came to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / fl@@ atten@@ ing ( 23 % ) and e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this review of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these studies , with five @-@ week treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , severe ero@@ sions ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe ch@@ oral formation and cal@@ ming ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials investigating the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was determined with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment site or in the surrounding area .
the in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ent or@@ ale intake of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clinical serious side @-@ effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg was in hyp@@ ot@@ ony norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous ab@@ lation .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines have been detected following the topical application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , it was shown that efficacy concerning a complete healing of the cow@@ ards in an i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment is significantly superior .
60 % of the patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine completely healed the patients ; this was 20 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 male patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 male patients treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in five @-@ day use per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all patients were clin@@ ically healed and this remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons within a co@@ hesi@@ ve 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the uncomfortable scal@@ p or face .
the single @-@ year data from two combined monitoring studies indicate a recur@@ r@@ ence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications external F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen , ac@@ tin@@ ian ker@@ ato@@ sis and super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not appear in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and therefore have not been studied .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , Plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be demonstrated in these studies during the dos@@ ages studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively ) .
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream due to the skin of 58 patients with act@@ ini@@ c ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml when applied in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin .
systemic exposure data showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study carried out for four months for der@@ mal application showed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not in@@ duce tum@@ ors at the application .
the mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od only has low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , there is a very low risk to the human being due to systemic exposure .
tum@@ ors appeared in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream , earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

for children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by around 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal big liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , pain sensation , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion site .
very common side effects in patients under the age of five are elevated blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known and update this summary whenever necessary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with regard to the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission issued a licence to the Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. to transport Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ ali@@ an cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Chinese ham@@ ster ov@@ arian ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosing scheme can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined , and no dosing scheme can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions defined as any related side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only take place in a reasonable clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ alization facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment , it is necessary to proceed cau@@ ti@@ ously .
60 minutes before commen@@ cing the in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a light or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ induced reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
the in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed by reducing the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate at which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ enz with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there are no data in new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were reported predominantly as in@@ fusion @-@ related responses observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , observed during the phase 3 study and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or over at a duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related complications of the upper respiratory tract and lung pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory down@@ times and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ desirable Drug Effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a Ph@@ as@@ e- 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years , with predominantly severe course of treatment and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients were treated with a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , whereas in the patients at the age of 5 with a severe form of sever@@ ity there was usually a ser@@ o@@ conversion ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature withdrawal from the study ) no antibodies were det@@ ectable in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say , including 3 patients who had never been treated with ser@@ o@@ per@@ version .
patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the urine of the G@@ AG in urine whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was observed .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low @-@ neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not seem to imp@@ air the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even if adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity .
following intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , the most likely via man@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged between 6 and 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study that showed the entire spectrum of disease , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( Fe@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected Fe@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week for a further 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed improvement of lung function and the ability to pay compared to the plac@@ ebo group , presented in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as highlighted in the following table .
the decrease of the expected percentage of Fe@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes further increased propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) up to the end of the study had normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of the G@@ AG level was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into account clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variable ( expected percentage normal feedback , range in the 6 @-@ minute walk , range of shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted , in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with severe sequ@@ ential form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ ag@@ - mirror in urine in week 22 .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with severe con@@ course form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed whereas only limited or no progress in cognitive development could be observed in the older patients .
in a phase @-@ 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing systems were performed on the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk @-@ test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosage schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ rop@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans .
since no gene@@ alo@@ gical studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except those listed under 6.@@ 6 .

within the given time , the holder of the permit for placing on the market has completed the following programme of studies , whose results form the basis for the annual evaluation report for the benefit @-@ risk ratio .
this Register will include long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which cle@@ ans certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , is either in a small amount , or this enzyme is missing completely .
in case you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines please inform your doctor if you are taking drugs that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine because there is a possible risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken , including non @-@ prescription medicines .
instructions for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate on the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for intraven@@ ous treatment ( see information for doctors and medical professionals ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ IV @-@ related implic@@ it in the upper respiratory tract and lung pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial oil .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drug against cancer ) and &quot; malign@@ ant &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and &quot; malign@@ ant &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy for patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapy regi@@ mens .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent de@@ hydr@@ ation ) should be given before or after the addition of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients whose blood image changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , stopped or the dose decreased .
the active form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from spreading .
the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed into its active form is more easily done in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study involving 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study involving 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the single administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the mean survival time of A@@ lim@@ ta was 8,@@ 3 months compared to 7,@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients in whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells reported longer survival times compared to the comparison drug in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. to sell A@@ lim@@ ta to the European Union .
each pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a 25 mg / ml solution .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² of KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the completion of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed @-@ Gift as well as on the day after treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , a minimum of 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ emet@@ ric dosage .
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) a week before the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed dose and after each third movement cycle .
in patients who receive P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood image should be created prior to each application , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and plat@@ el@@ et c@@ ysts .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
a dose verification must take place at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , taking into account the N@@ adi@@ r blood pattern or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 that apply to A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
should patients not develop ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA needs to be stopped if a ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ti@@ o stages or continued with the appearance of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that at the age of 65 years or more patients at the age of 65 have an increased risk of side effects .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 @-@ times the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; 3.0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( if metast@@ ases in liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value ( for the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied specifically in the studies .
patients need to be monitored with regard to bone market res@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed may not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ al count re@@ stores a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the plat@@ el@@ et of cy@@ tes again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ es , plat@@ el@@ ets and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in the preceding cycles of treatment ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was examined if pre @-@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed need to be instructed to use foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure for the reduction of treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with moderate to moderate ren@@ al failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non@@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ ic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients for whom treatment is provided with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed need to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients displaying these events had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ existing high blood pressure , or diabetes .
therefore , a drainage of the eff@@ usion before the P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed treatment should be considered in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid retention in the trans@@ cellular space .
5 Major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical studies with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed when this active substance was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible impair@@ ment of reproductive ability is due to P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised in front of the treatment order to obtain advice regarding sperm conservation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can result in reduced P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects .
it is therefore advisable to use high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy , be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - xed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - or an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , serious birth defects are expected in an application during pregnancy .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed may not be used during pregnancy unless required and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive ability is due to P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised to consult with regard to the block@@ age retention before the start of treatment .
it is not known whether P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed moves into breast milk and unwanted effects on the breast@@ fed inf@@ ant cannot be ruled out .

A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti @-@ fol@@ ate that ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting important metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed works as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with multiple targets by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ at@@ re@@ duk@@ t@@ ase ( DH@@ CP ) and gly@@ c@@ ami@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes in the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and pur@@ ul@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ enter , random@@ ized , single @-@ blind phase 3 study by A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural kin@@ eli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage of survival compared to those who were only bund@@ led with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the test medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural kin@@ eli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the single c@@ is@@ pl@@ ine arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms resulted from an improvement in lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC after prior chemotherapy was treated with patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and of 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival fell in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with N@@ SC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ dis@@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ) , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a separately random@@ ised , controlled phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analysis of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination with gem@@ cit@@ abine in c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .

the analysis of the influence of N@@ SC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in accordance with hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = Con@@ fi@@ dence interval ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = magnitude of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ compliance threshold of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin required fewer trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28@@ ,@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) , er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.0@@ 002 ) .
furthermore , patients required the administration of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n / Dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ eti@@ n ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.1 % , p = 0.0@@ 00@@ 4 ) , and iron supplements ( 4.3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed as mono@@ therapeu@@ tics were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tum@@ ors in doses of 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is found in the urine within 24 hours of the application .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ life in the plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .

A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is used in patients who have not received prior chemotherapy to treat the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma ( malign@@ ant disease of the ri@@ b case ) in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , another medicine for the treatment of cancer .
if you have kidney disease or earlier , please discuss this with your doctor or hospital oth@@ ec@@ ologist , as you may not be allowed to receive A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
you will be able to carry out blood tests before any in@@ fusion ; it checks whether your kidney and liver function is sufficient and whether you have enough blood cells to keep A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 49 .
your doctor may possibly change the dose or susp@@ end treatment if it requires your general condition and if your blood values are too low .
if you also receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , your doctor will ensure that your body contains sufficient water and you will receive the necessary medicines to avoid vom@@ iting before and after the c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin dosage .
if you have a fluid accumulation around the lungs , your doctor may decide to remove this liquid before you get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
if you would like to be a child during the treatment or in the first 6 months of treatment , please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
interactions with other medicines Please tell your doctor if you are taking medicines against pain or inflammation ( swelling ) such as such drugs that are called non@@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) , including pharmaceuticals that are not prescription ( such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) .
depending on the planned da@@ - tum of your A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in@@ fusion and / or the extent of your kidney function , your doctor will tell you which other medicines you can take and when .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not associated with prescription pharmaceuticals .
a hospital oth@@ ec@@ ologist , nursing staff or a doctor will mix the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA powder with a sterile 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) before it is applied to you .
your doctor will prescri@@ be you cor@@ tis@@ one tablets ( equivalent to 4 mg of dex@@ am@@ eth@@ a two times daily ) that you must take on the day before , on the day during and on the day following the application of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
your doctor will prescri@@ be you foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) for taking or mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amins which contain foli@@ c acid ( 350 to 1000 micro@@ grams ) , which you must take one time daily during the application of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
in the week before the application of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and approximately every 9 weeks ( corresponding to 3 cycles of treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ) you will also receive an injection of vi@@ - t@@ amin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if a side effect is described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this means that it was reported by at least 1 out of 10 patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the resulting solution is clear and the colo@@ uring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green @-@ yellow without compromising the quality of the product .
it is used for overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ calorie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who take All@@ i and do not have weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metaboli@@ se some fats in the food , which causes approximately one quarter of the fats to be supplied with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed to the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , 3@@ 91 compared patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies of patients with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who had recovered All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of plac@@ ebo .
in the study with all@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss relevant to patients could be observed .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at after , fl@@ atus ( winds ) with bow@@ el movement , bow@@ h@@ ld@@ iness , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily stools , ab@@ duct o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( fa@@ des ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ ts patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( not sufficient nutrients from the digestive tract ) or cholesterol ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a licence to the Gla@@ xo Group Limited for placing Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K on the market across the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fat @-@ induced diet .
all@@ i may not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , since there are insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
since or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ ption , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or any of the other ingredients • C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic Mal@@ absorption Syndrome • P@@ reg@@ ancy ( see section 4.6 ) • De@@ aling time ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a low @-@ fat single meal or a fat @-@ rich diet .
since weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a treatment with all@@ i , as the dosage of anti@@ diab@@ etic medicine may need to be adjusted .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures in order to prevent the potential failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in a study on the interactions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( internationally normal ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials remained the levels of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta car@@ ot@@ ene in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take supplements of the mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time in order to ensure adequate vitamin absorption ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the addition of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug as the absorption of recorded fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data is not estimated ) .
the incidence of known side effects noted after the introduction of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain size .
† Es are plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obes@@ e subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings occurring .
in the majority of cases reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on examinations on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects can be assumed , which can be attributed to the existing properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect prev@@ ails in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by means of co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in remnant of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
from clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 att@@ est to the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight relative to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first six months .
the average dietary change in the Gesamt@@ cholest@@ erin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % with or@@ list@@ at - 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average LD@@ L Cholester@@ ins change was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % with or@@ list@@ at ( bas@@ eline 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( bas@@ eline value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be detected spor@@ adic@@ ally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.0@@ 2 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study with obes@@ e patients who administered the minimal systemic res@@ or@@ bi@@ ated dose , two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , i.e. M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 , after the N @-@ Form@@ yl leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified , which represented approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated applications , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , can@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will affect you considerably or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this utility information .
the most common side effects depend on the mode of action of the capsules and are created by ex@@ cre@@ ting fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of the treatment , as you may have not yet consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the diet @-@ related side effects : • Beg@@ in already a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may take for each meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a rich dessert , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction .
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • Do not store all@@ i after the exp@@ iry date specified on the board . • Do not store over 25 ° C . • The container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .

obesity has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hyper@@ tension • Diabetes • Heart Disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis Please consult your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
lasting weight loss , for example by improving diet and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and have a positive impact on your health .
choose meals containing a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find in food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should consume at maximum per day .
note the tables below in this section . • The recommended intake of fat in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
the amount of calories it is suitable for you can be found in the information below , which indicates the number of calories suitable for you . • Due to the capsule &apos;s mode of action , compliance with the recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize the weight loss while reducing the lik@@ el@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms .
34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose weight about 0.5 kg per week without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you burn daily only little or nothing at all , work steps in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal every day , for example through 3 km walk , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For lasting weight loss , it is necessary to place realistic calorie and fat targets and adhere to them . • Sen@@ se is a dietary diary with information on calorie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you begin taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program for supporting weight loss combines the capsules with a food plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed on calorie and fat du@@ ets and give guidelines to become more physically active .
in combination with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a heal@@ thier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies which are the medi@@ oc@@ re cause of nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi is increased by the addition of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the active substance inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was examined in 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the medi@@ cam@@ ent trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a licence to the Company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in the case of exc@@ essively her@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting induced by highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ ne@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of sub@@ acute i@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is required with simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that pro@@ long the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to such extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi should not be used either for prevention or to treat nausea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five studied chemotherapy drugs ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ abine , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady st@@ ate@@ - concentration oral meth@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population showed that the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( ami@@ o@@ dar@@ one , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , hal@@ operi@@ dol , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences for the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not present , therefore , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events were reported at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly related to Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the place of delivery ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar occur@@ ren@@ ces of adverse events as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy in an al@@ op@@ ia over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 of dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life time 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given that was given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients receiving a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical studies of indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval were comparable to the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of preliminary clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and re@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and to extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the E@@ KG effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron administered in I.@@ V. in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption Accor@@ ding to IV administration following an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area below the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ propor@@ tionally .
following intraven@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations , the overall composition ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) reached at once daily intraven@@ ous dosage of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to that after a one @-@ off intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ max was higher after the addition of 0.@@ 75 mg .
approximately 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in vitro studies on metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , are involved in the enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous 10 micro@@ gram / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified active substance made about 40 % of the given dose .
following a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous captive bolt injection in healthy patients the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the termin@@ ale elimination time and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after exposure to ex@@ positions , which are considered adequate above the maximal human@@ therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 Pre @-@ clinical trials showed that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only very high concentrations of ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose expressed in approximately 30 times the therapeutic exposure of humans ) , which were given daily for two years , resulted in increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , en@@ doc@@ rine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is intended for a unique application in humans , the relevance of these results is low as for the human being .
the holder of this approval for the placing on the market must notify the European Commission of the plans for the placing of the drug approved within the framework of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) passed a negative report , in which the approval of the medicine for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicinal product called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( liver disease caused by virus infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic investigation the liver tissue has damages , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ o s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are elevated in the blood standard .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates it to the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon gave data that substanti@@ ate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon using Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and six months after the treatment had stopped treatment ( i.e. no indication of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
furthermore , concerns were vo@@ iced to the fact that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease fl@@ ared up again in more patients than with the reference drug ; Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug triggers an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , is not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection that is associated with cru@@ st@@ ac@@ al formation ) and small in@@ infected in@@ fir@@ ations ( cra@@ cking or cutting wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not be affected by these kinds of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the skin surface to be treated should not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5,@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients in plac@@ ebo responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together with skin wound , approximately 90 % of both groups responded to the treatment .
however , in these two studies it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ice @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that were demon@@ stra@@ bly or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the place of the job .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go were predomin@@ ant in the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wound wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a licence to the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . , a licence for the marketing of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the event of sensi@@ ti@@ zing or severe local irrit@@ ation by using ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment the treatment should be stopped , the o@@ int@@ ment must be carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection will commen@@ ce .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as a patho@@ gen ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) in clinical trials was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected area after a 2 to 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of the simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations , which have been achieved in humans for topical application on sk@@ ewed skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo is not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After a simultaneous oral administration of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max under topical application of 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on a sk@@ ewed skin of healthy adult men increased by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dose adjustments are not required if topical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral ing@@ es@@ tion and are inadequate in relation to a statement affecting the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of systemic antibiotics .
in deciding whether the breast@@ feeding should be continued or termin@@ ated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued or termin@@ ated , consider the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections that Al@@ tar@@ go used , the most commonly reported side effect was irrit@@ ation at the date of delivery which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a specific binding site of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that distinguishes itself from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data suggest that the binding point ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Center .
by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bit the pep@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding and prevent normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in at least some infection forms seem to be question@@ able , advice should be sought by experts .
there were no differences in the in vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the event of a non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tr@@ unks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption in a healthy adult study , 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice a day for 5 days for the topical treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
samples were taken on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic absorption on humans after topical use of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 sk@@ ewed skin ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the retin@@ ot@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro examination on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in mouse lymph@@ oma test respectively in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in the rats micro@@ kernel test for in vivo investigation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thereby achieving an exposure of up to 5 times higher than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 sk@@ ewed skin :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were observed .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix will be applied as part of a two @-@ cann@@ ed vacc@@ ination plan , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved once the second dose is administered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immun@@ isation process and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses can lead to an end .
if a refres@@ her dose is desired for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or any other hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines work by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immune system ( natural def@@ ences of the body ) , as it can defend itself against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine Twin@@ CA@@ rix adults approved since 1996 and the vaccine Twin@@ CA@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , both adults and Mac@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ das contain adults identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Mac@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator for efficacy was the percentage of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix performed between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective anti @-@ antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar to a six @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection site , redness , mat@@ iness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als s.@@ a. a permit for the placing of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the standardi@@ zation plan for the pri@@ di@@ mm@@ ini@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , the first dose is given at the date of the election and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a booster is requested both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vaccine can be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) are the same as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully ensured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have addressed hepatitis A vacc@@ ination require a booster disease as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in case of no more det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the addition of the vaccine should always be immediately available for medical treatment and monitoring .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended using the combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of formal in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value after pri@@ di@@ mming , so that in these cases the administration of further vacc@@ ines may be required .
these inj@@ ections should be avoided as intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration into the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal in@@ fusion .
however , in cases of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ots , however , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected by sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections as it can occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration of bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( D@@ T@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or combined with a combined mass of m@@ um@@ ps , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it must be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study , which was carried out with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ch@@ iness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier Thi@@ omer@@ Salt and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 V@@ acc@@ ins Ambi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 V@@ acc@@ ines at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years , Ambi@@ rix compatibility was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ch@@ iness on a calculation basis per V@@ acc@@ ine dose of Ambi@@ rix , but not on a basis for calculation per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix in 50@@ .@@ 7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.1 % in the subjects after the dose of a 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had received Ambi@@ rix had reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects that had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ can combination vaccine .
however , the abundance of matches was comparable to per test band ( i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who were given an ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and pain was low and comparable to those observed after the combination of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vaccine .
in a comparative study of 1- and 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ inations , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that which was observed in combination with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formal in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after in@@ oc@@ ulation with Ambi@@ rix a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the share of vacc@@ inations that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials , which were conducted for vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years , the anti @-@ HA@@ V ser@@ o@@ conversion rates were 9@@ 9,@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study carried out at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine containing three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evalu@@ able , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 were significantly higher compared to the 3 @-@ dose vaccine than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immun@@ o@@ hist@@ ories achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1- and 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vaccine received either a 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units with form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were aged between 12 and 15 years old , persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after im@@ muni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immun@@ ore@@ action against both anti@@ gens observed in this study was comparable to that after in@@ oc@@ ulation of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units with form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after im@@ muni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life coinci@@ ded with the booster release of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates similar to the former formulation for the present formulation .
the vaccine must be examined both before and after res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing to any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .
according to article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state charge release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as bathing in waters contaminated by water .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may necess@@ itate a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not completely protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B Virus prior to administration of both V@@ acc@@ ination doses ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after a hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any ingredient of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction may be caused by it@@ chy skin ras@@ hes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • if you have already an allergic reaction to a previous vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B if you / your child has a serious infection with fever .
• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and before the usual scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child of an in@@ oc@@ ulation with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective components per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a formal in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected by persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s own immune system , or if you / your child is undergoing a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child will take other medicines ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated recently or has received / has been given or immun@@ o@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have been given / or this is planned in the near future .
however , in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine needs to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as many limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the response to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix will not be administered pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgent that they be vacc@@ inated against both hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot; &quot; &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .

ambient rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that have become known since the first approval for the placing of the market , the CH@@ MP asser@@ ted that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remained positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was placed in circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine are limited due to low patient exposure .
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in pre@@ history for patients aged over 1 month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) .
Am@@ mon@@ aps - split into several individual doses at meals - is swal@@ lowed , mixed into the food or administered via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading tube ) .
it was not a comparative study , because Am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared with a different treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ medication , i.e. without an active agent ) .
am@@ mon@@ aps can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acidity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste sensation , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevents high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was admitted under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the application is indicated in all patients , in which a complete lack of enzyme already mani@@ f@@ ests itself in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , an indication is applied when a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy exists in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ule form .
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein absorption of the patient for the growth and development .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early deficiency of car@@ bam@@ bo@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ in@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ inate deficiency need to receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , as there is a risk of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a formation if the tablets do not reach the stomach immediately .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , respectively 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or serious ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , as well as in conjunction with sodium retention and dem@@ or@@ alization .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate over the liver and kidneys occurs , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) resulted in slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal prolifer@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thereby impaired brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the breast milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least 56 % of patients had at least one adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ ed top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of an over@@ dose occurred during a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms come with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is an active compound that is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 Pati@@ ents with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram taken sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and treatment is immediately started in order to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease itself led to death even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues .
by h@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of neu@@ tered in post@@ part@@ al ( however , within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in those patients it occurred with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the Or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and were subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further wor@@ sen@@ ing of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is enz@@ ym@@ atic con@@ ju@@ gated with glut@@ amine in the liver and kidneys , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined according to a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate for so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following IV administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , 15 minutes after intake meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected .
according to various doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma was det@@ ectable in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ l@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys within 24 hours to approximately 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate had no plain@@ tive effects in rats treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic cans ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( babies and children who cannot take tablets or patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early deficiency of car@@ bam@@ bo@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ in@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat @-@ fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) , l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex occurred .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ ed top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess ammon@@ ia .
on the basis of investigations on the secre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that for each gram taken sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen is produced .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment , and in some patients a further wor@@ sen@@ ing of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ular form , 15 minutes after intake meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected .
during the period of durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are absent so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after consuming proteins .
if you carry out laboratory tests , you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is non @-@ prescription pharmaceuticals .
during breast@@ feeding , you must@@ n &apos;t take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine may pass to breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturbances , trac@@ ing of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory problems and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you encounter one of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency reception of your hospital in order to initiate an appropriate treatment .
if you forgot to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in blood count ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention ( swelling ) , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant skin odor , skin rash , kidney function , weight gain , and abnormal laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will affect you considerably or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this utility information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can no longer use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ iry date specified on the box and the container according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; App@@ lic@@ able to &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS and the contents of the package AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are marked with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot;
30 If any laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is non @-@ prescription pharmaceuticals .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS spread over the same single doses or@@ ally or via a stomach fi@@ stel ( hose which runs through the stomach wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose leading through the nose to the stomach ) .
31 • Take a he@@ aped spo@@ on@@ ful of gran@@ ulate from the container . • P@@ ut a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the top of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The quantity remaining in the measuring spoon corresponds to a measuring spoon .
an@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in cases of unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) ( abnormal measurement of electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if an@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox@@ in was compared with only a dose or in connection with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) compared with the conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during PCI , patients were often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots like ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of GP@@ I - was as effective as conventional treatment in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year .
in patients undergoing a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective in all indicators as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , with which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other ingredients .
it may also not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for he@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd , for the placing of an@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended starting dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous intake of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient is subsequently PCI , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements .
a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered immediately before the procedure , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial IV in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of an exclusive Bol@@ us @-@ Gift from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is reduced to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicinal product should be carefully mixed before the application and the bolt dosage should be administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered properly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which one PCI is subjected to ( whether treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din vs. ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second dose of the bolt must be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which were included in the approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the application of the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for patients with di@@ aly@@ sis , An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous injection of frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or any other ingredients or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages or increased risk of bleeding due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ ost@@ asis system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • serious kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for patients with di@@ aly@@ sis
patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if the most bleeding of arter@@ ial spots occurs in the case of PCI patients under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can occur during the treatment , in principle , bleeding .
in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with a bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , monitoring the IN@@ R value ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling of the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din returns the existing level before treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ ten@@ aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters are checked regularly .
animal experimental investigations are inadequate in relation to the effects of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , de @-@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparative groups treated with he@@ par@@ in were more common in women and patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding like in Table 2 foot@@ notes .
both ble@@ edings and ble@@ edings were significantly less frequent under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din than in the groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or plus bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ dine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the punc@@ ture area , which necess@@ it@@ ates radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , reduction of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in mirror ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other , less commonly observed bleeding locations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ ture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following information on adverse events is based on data from a clinical study conducted with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparative groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , it was more common in women and patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients .
both ble@@ edings and ble@@ edings were significantly less frequent under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice following a comprehensive application and are group@@ ed according to system organism classes in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with a bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is immediately broken off and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific thro@@ mb@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre and to the ion binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is present in the liquid phase or in cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , on its part , slowly spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thus re@@ generating the function of the active centre of thro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with ser@@ um of patients who had come to he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ sis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) did not in@@ duce a plat@@ el@@ et ag@@ gregation reaction .
in healthy subjects and in patients , bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent an@@ tic@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is covered by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI is performed in the following , an additional pin of 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients who required angi@@ ography within 72 hours were equally distributed across the 3 arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia ; 70 % had dynamic EK@@ C changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children aged six and older with diabetes requiring treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is administered sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or insulin cannot be effectively processed .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin is very slightly different from the human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting insulin insul@@ ator .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in the application in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between 4 and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , where the body insulin cannot be processed effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was to change the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of type 1 diabetes in adults , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed in comparison to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin li@@ spr@@ o .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % with human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin lu@@ li@@ sin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal wall , th@@ igh or delta muscle , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion into the area of the abdominal cavity .
due to the reduced glucose level and the reduced insulin metabolism , insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function .
the type of insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc ret@@ arding , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production , can lead to changes in insulin requirements .
3 An insufficient dosage or interruption of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening .
a patient &apos;s switch to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change in the dosage necessary .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme .
the substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency towards hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia include oral anti@@ diab@@ e@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ con@@ ver@@ ting enzymes ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sy@@ mp@@ ol@@ oly@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ dine and reser@@ pine , the symptoms of the adren@@ al counter@@ regulation can be weakened or missing .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and Human@@ insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin lu@@ li@@ sin occurs in the human breast milk , but generally insulin does not enter the breast milk nor is absorbed by oral use .
below , the un@@ desirable drug verteb@@ rates that are known from clinical trials are classified according to system organism classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of occurrence ( very often : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1.000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 1,000 ) ; not known ( frequency on the basis of available data is not estimated ) .
cold welding , cool and pale skin , ti@@ redness , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , drow@@ sin@@ ess , excessive hun@@ - , head@@ aches , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy will be fo@@ amed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , as a result , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given by an appropriately trained person , or by intraven@@ ous glucose from glucose by a doctor .
after glu@@ ing , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption ( especially by skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) and by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies of healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that the effect occurs faster in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin and the duration of the active insulin is shorter than with a cou@@ gh @-@ man@@ em insulin analog insulin .
in a study with 18 male subjects at the age of 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus insulin lu@@ li@@ sin showed a dispro@@ portion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ es@@ tic effect in the therapeutic @-@ relevant dosage range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ es@@ ening effect , exactly like Human@@ insulin .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin has a double as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect approximately 2 hours earlier than a human insulin .
it was evident from the data that a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved in an application of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal , as with the human insulin analog insulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin lu@@ li@@ sin was cooled 2 minutes before the meal , better post@@ p@@ ran@@ al control was achieved than with the human insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with the human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - nu@@ ten before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - previously ) before the start of the meal compared to normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1A ) and compared to a human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to the human Nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) .
