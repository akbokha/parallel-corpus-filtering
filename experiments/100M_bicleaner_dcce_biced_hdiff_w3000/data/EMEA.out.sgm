<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) evaluated the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your illness or treatment, please read the package (also included in the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For further information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melt tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Uncle thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • bipolar I disorder, a mental disorder where patients have periods of abnormal mood alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and for the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for fast control of increased restlessness or behavioural disturbances if the oral ingestion of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used to take or melt tablets in patients with difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, as well as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs signal transmission between brain cells through "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells among themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "Aripiprazole is believed to be" "" "partial agony" "" "for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin)." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters, is used to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify, which can prevent the recurrence of symptoms, has been studied in three studies for up to a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared with placebo in two studies of 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from increased restlessness over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, compared to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, who suffered from increased restlessness, compared to that of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients was examined by a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melt tablets and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg had a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms of increased restlessness than the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively in four of the five short-term studies than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented the recurrence of manic episodes with previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks, and in addition to an existing treatment was administered.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as laurel epam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled), retinitiation (drowsiness), retinitiation (drowsiness), vomiting, nausea, vomiting (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disruption and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients with predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes addressed the treatment with Aripiprazole were predominant against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the board came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in case of rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disturbance if oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued a licence to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the placing of Abilify in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients with predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes responded to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proved.</seg>
<seg id="33">Considering the greater sensitivity of these patients, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 Inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results from an epidemiological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including aczeleriated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients treated with Abilify occur signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia, consider reducing the dose or breaking the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions related to seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychoses associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of dying compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There was, however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsia, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored with respect to deteriorating glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania due to comborbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally-effective drugs with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107%, while Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") Metabolization, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole as compared to CYP2D6 Extensive Metabolization.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteaseininhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dosisreductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After settling the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose height before the start of the accompanying treatment.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram, or CYP2D6, together with Abilify, can be expected with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the mediums of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine-ratio), 2C9 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data base for the safety of humans and due to the concerns resulting from the reproduction studies of animals, this medicine may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on it.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side-effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, patients who were treated with Aripiprazol showed a total reduced incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and dyskinesia compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazol was 15.1% in patients with Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I disturbance - In a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase of over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">Comparing the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo with potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Side effects that may occur in connection with antipsychotic therapy are the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional acute overdosages with Aripiprazole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">Admittedly, there is no information about the effectiveness of a hematalysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazol; however, it is unlikely that hematalysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose since Aripiprazol has a high plasmaple connection.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated on the combination of a partially agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1-receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a-receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed in vitro a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1 and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and to the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">The positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on the nucleus caudatus and on the putname.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 percent of respondents' response to study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives including PANSS and Montgomery Asberg- depression rate scale showed significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">A placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher return rate for Aripiprazol, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a placebo-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, involving 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca.).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disturbance, Aripiprazole showed a placebo superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study of 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disturbance, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and actively controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, Aripiprazol showed an efficacy comparable to placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12, Aripiprazol also showed a similar proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the manie, such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which in part did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long-term development phase over 74 weeks for manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, Aripiprazole showed himself superior to placebo in the prevention of a bipolar relapse, predominantly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxylotion of Aripiprazol, the N-Dealkyylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole with extensive metabolism via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in the pharmacokinetic between male and female healthy subjects, and in a pharmacokinetic examination schizophrenic patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A simulation-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics did not reveal any clinically significant differences regarding the ethnic affiliation or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity in repeated applications, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the canogenic potential, preclinical data did not identify any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in doses or expositions which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so that they only have limited or no significance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent non-kidney toxicity (lipofuscin pigmentation accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equals 3 to 10 times the moderate Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, cholelithiasis has been determined as a result of the precipitation of sulfate-conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazol in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose in humans (mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, concentrations of the sulfate conjugates of hydroxy- aripiprazole found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the bile of monkeys and lie far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages leading to exposure of 3- and 11x of the medium-sized steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="144">As soon as it is clinically attached, the treatment with the Aripiprazol injection solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="145">In order to increase resorption and minimise the variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the Gluteus maximus muscle is recommended in circumference of obese regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status, taking into account the medicine already used for maintenance or acut therapy (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazole, see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to Abilify tablets, Abilify melting tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations on the efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution in patients with aggitizing and behavioural disorders, which have been caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar-I disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazol injection solution, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or a blood pressure drop (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">The safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution is not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including aczeleriated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, muscle stiffness, changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsia, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored with respect to deteriorating glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania due to comborbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared with the alluvial administration of Aripiprazole, in a study in which healthy volunteers Aripiprazole (15 mg dose) was administered intramuscular and at the same time received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") Metabolization, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- proteaseininhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dosisreductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After settling the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose height before the start of the accompanying treatment.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 laureates (2 mg dose) were received intramuscular, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared with the alluvial administration of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events were more common in clinical trials with Aripiprazol injection solutions than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side-effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side-effects (*) in clinical trials (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another 12 weeks study, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase for 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="168">Comparing the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo with potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Side effects that may occur in connection with antipsychotic therapy are the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disturbances was the Aripiprazol injection solution with statistically significantly greater improvements of aggiteness / behavioural disturbances compared with placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-time study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as aggitiousness and behavioural disturbances, the Aripiprazol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms with regard to the toxicity and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the laurel reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement from the initial value on the PANSS Excitement Component score was 5,8 for placebo, 9,6 for lauazepam and 8,7 for Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe detachment, a similar efficacy was observed with regard to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol (orally) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 percent of respondents' response to study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% (oral) and haloperidol (73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg depression rate scale, showed significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher return rate was reported for Aripiprazol (orally), which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In a placebo-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, involving 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, an increase of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca.).</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which in part did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, Aripiprazole showed himself superior to placebo in the prevention of a bipolar relapse, predominantly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazol AUC is 90% larger than the AUC after injection of the same dose as tablet in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The application of Aripiprazol injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated administration in a systemic exposure (AUC), which occurred between 15 and 5 times over the maximum humantherapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity following intravenous application there were no safety-relevant concerns after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbit) above the maximum humantherapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazol (oral) for safety macropology, toxicity with repeated administration, reproduction toxicity, genotoxicity and the canogenic potential, preclinical data did not identify any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in doses or expositions which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans; therefore, they only have limited or no significance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent non-kidney toxicity (lipofuscin pigmentation accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans and an increase of adrenal bark carcinomas and combined adrenal bark-adenomas / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the average rate of the rate in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, cholelithiasis was established as a result of the precipitation of sulfate-conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazol in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1- to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="190">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages leading to exposure of 3- and 11-times of the medium steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was investigated in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three quarters had previously received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole gift or as monotherapy) was compared with a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side-effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, 72 (31%) of the 229 patients treated with Abraxane responded to treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel drugs.</seg>
<seg id="270">Considering only those who were treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between drug efficacy indicators such as time to worsening of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">Moreover, it must not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) found that Abraxane was more effective in patients in whom the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional paclitaxel and that in contrast to other paclitaxel drugs it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission issued a licence to the company Abraxis BioScience Limited for the distribution of Abraxane throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anthracycline-containing therapy is not shown (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophine count &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or a severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory neuropathy Grade 3, treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is achieved by Level 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles, the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function (see Section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">No studies with patients with impaired renal function have been performed and there are currently no adequate data to endorse dose adjustments in patients with impairment of kidney function (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bonded nanoparticle formulation of Paclitaxel, which could have significantly different pharmacological features than other formulations of paclitaxel (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptomatic treatment is initiated, and the patient must not be treated with paclitaxel again.</seg>
<seg id="283">In the patients, no renewed Abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neutrophal number has increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the platelet number is increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunctions (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While equivocally with Abraxane has not been proved in connection with cardiotoxicity, cardiac incidents in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If there is nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in the patients after the application of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual methods of antiemics and constipating means.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used for pregnant women or women in childbearing age who do not practice an effective contraception, except the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Pregnant women should use a reliable contraceptive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients who are treated with Abraxane are advised to not give birth to a child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised about a sperm conservation before the treatment, because the therapy with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very often) and dizziness (often) which can affect the traffic airiness and the ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events performed in 229 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in the pivotal Phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most striking important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of the patients) and was quickly reversible and dosisdependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of the patients treated with Abraxane and was severe (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl) in three cases.</seg>
<seg id="295">In Table 1, the side effects listed in conjunction with the addition of Abraxane as monotherapy at every dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, ≥ 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1.000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally, increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatinine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, hurt gums, loose stools, ecsophagitis, pain in the lower abdomen, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of the muscles, neck pain, groin pain, muscle spasms, pain in the skeletal musculature, joint pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very frequently:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite related case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no causal connection with these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubules substance that promotes the accumulation of microtubules from the tubulous tubing and stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting their depository polymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubulous network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin transmits transytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies it has been proved that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albumrezeptor and a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumor due to the albuminous protein SPARC (Refted protein acidic rich in cysteine).</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-armed unfaded studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study, 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion of 63 patients with mamma carcinoma over 30 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of a solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour intravenous premedication for preventing an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premediation (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy before, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% due to metastasis and 19% due to metastasis and for adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for overall response rate and time to disease progression as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First-Line therapy are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity in relation to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy grade 3 during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to decay on baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Exposure to active substance (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous dose of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma at the recommended dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase way.</seg>
<seg id="318">The medium distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume points to a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or combination of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with advanced solid tumors, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel following intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 were compared with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">After the Abraxane administration the clearance of paclitaxel was higher (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In published literature on in vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, it is reported that paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, the mean for cumulative urinal excretion of the unchanged active substance was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, suggesting far-reaching non-renal clearing.</seg>
<seg id="323">Over 75 years of age, only a few data are available, as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected against light over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anti-carcinogenic medicine and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be taken care of when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile syringe, 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution is injected into an Abraxane dipping bottle over a period of at least 1 minute (0.9%).</seg>
<seg id="327">After complete addition of the solution, the piercing bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wetting of the solid.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the piercing bottle should be swivelled slowly and cautiously for at least 2 minutes and / or inverted until a complete reset-board of the powder is made.</seg>
<seg id="329">If precipitations or sinks are visible, the piercing bottle needs to be inverted gently, in order to achieve a complete resuspension before applying.</seg>

<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood vessels, in which complications may occur in connection with a blood transfusion, if a self-blood donation is not possible before the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self-bleeding end, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection may also be carried out by the patient or his supervisor if they have received an appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure or for patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anemia may be caused by erythropoietine deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was inserted that enables it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared to the reference medical drug when administered as an injection into a vein as part of a major study involving 479 patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected into a vein at least eight weeks before they were either switched to seamed or continued Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the start of the study and the assessment period between 25 and 29 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of abseamed injected under the skin were investigated with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients treated to abseamed were maintained to the same degree as those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0,063 g / dl of the baseline value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally cause symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, piercing migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed, according to the provisions of the European Union, evidence was provided that the drug has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that manufactures abseamed will provide information packages to healthcare professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Medice pharmaceuticals Pütter GmbH & Co KG to approve the placing of abseamed across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma that receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of transfusion due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, preexisting anaemia at the beginning of chemotherapy) exists.</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8,1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, in case of planned larger operative procedures requiring a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood in women; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">To reduce foreign blood, Abseamed can be used before a large elective orthopaedic surgery in adults without iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml, which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">Hemoglobin concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients, in which the haemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms of anemia and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and total disease burden; therefore, the doctor requires evaluation of the individual clinical course and disease condition.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in the hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can be observed over or below the haemoglobin target concentration in one patient.</seg>
<seg id="389">In light of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the persistent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest approved dose required for controlling anemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The clinical results suggest that patients with a very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where the initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The clinical results suggest that patients with a very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where the initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week via intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and - following symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and total disease burden; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">In light of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest approved dose which is required for controlling the symptoms of anemia.</seg>
<seg id="398">If the hemoglobin value is increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the amount of recurrence of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared with the initial value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin rise &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the reticulocyte number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl have increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.E. / kg three times a week the haemoglobin value of ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the amount of recurrence of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to the epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the initial deposit of ≥ 4 blood conserene is required, should receive abseamed in a dose of 600 I.U. / kg of body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the onset of the autologous blood donation programme - to make large iron reserves available before the start of the abseamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Here epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg every 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection at the end of dialysis can be given over the tube of a fistula needle followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure a sufficient injection of the drug into the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who suffer from erythropoetin (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) under the treatment with any erythropoetin should not receive an abseamed or other erythropoetin (see Section 4.4 - erythroblastoopia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (e.g. known venous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">The use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients who are unable to participate in an autologous blood donation program: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial vascular disease, vascular disease of the carbonitis or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblablastoma (PRCA) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after monate- to years of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of activity, defined as reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reticulozytenvalue should be determined and the usual causes for a non-contact (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminum toxicity, infections or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) should be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reticulocyte value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the reticulocyte "index"), is low (&lt; 20.000 / mm3 or &lt; 0.5%), the thrombocytes and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other reason for an effective loss is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and a diagnosis of the bone marrow for diagnosis of a PRCA is considered.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of abseamed in patients with a risk of antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the gift of epoetins if the haemoglobin concentration is increased via the concentration required to control the symptoms of anemia and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">Hemoglobin should amount to about 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically-evident coronary heart disease or congestion failure, the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which is not yet to be dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In case of tumour patients with chemotherapy, a 2-3-week delay between epoetin alfa and the erythropoetin response should be taken into account for the evaluation of the therapy efficiency of epoetin alfa (patients who may have to be transfounded).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapic anaemia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk weighing while taking part in the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients provided for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible, before the beginning of epoetin alfa therapy the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing major elective orthopaedics should receive adequate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial haemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of post-operative thrombotic / vascular events may exist.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or to reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>

<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who recently had a hip fracture; the number of fractures was investigated over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">In the case of Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies with a total of 357 patients and compared with risedronat (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator for the efficacy was whether the alkaline phosphatase content in the serum (an enzyme that breaks down bone substance) normalized in the blood or decreased by at least 75% compared to the baseline value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients with Aclasta (without other osteoporosis medication) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to the placebo patients.</seg>
<seg id="578">Patients taking Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis treatments) with those under Placebo reduced the risk of hip fractures by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study with men and women with hip fracture, 9% of patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the patients in placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of the side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledron acid or other bisphosphonates or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients in Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney complaints, reactions to the infusion site and osteonnecrosis (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Aclasta provides information for physicians who prescribe Aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis that contains information on how to apply the medicine, as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission issued a licence to the company Novartis Europharm Limited to sell Aclasta to the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • The package supplement • contraindication in pregnancy and breast-feeding women • need for adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, adequate physical activity, non-smoking and healthy eating • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk for fractures, including in patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, an intravenous 5 mg aclasta infusion is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of Aclasta's infusion is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the disease Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After a treatment of the Paget disease with Aclasta, a long remission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget an adequate intake of calcium, in accordance with twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.E. orally or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days of the treatment of Aclasta can be reduced by adding paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney dysfunction (see section 4.4) For patients with a creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended because there are limited clinical experience for this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of elderly patients is similar to younger ones.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents under 18 years of age are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18, as data on safety and efficacy are lacking.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalzaemia is treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to treatment with Aclasta (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid implementation of the effect of zoledron acid on bone reconstruction, temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypocemia may develop, whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget an adequate intake of calcium, in accordance with twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancers, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, bad oral hygiene) should be considered a dental check with appropriate preventive dental treatment before an application of bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="604">No data is available for patients who need dental intervention, whether the interruption of treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteoecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the treatment of Aclasta can be reduced by adding paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of suspected cases of atrial fibrillation reported in patients who received Aclasta increased (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to those receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), the total frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 10), common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1.000) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction Zoledronic acid was associated with kidney dysfunction, which was associated with kidney function (i.e. an increase in the serum creatinine) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The changes in the Creatinin-Clearance (measured every year before the administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a reduced kidney function were comparable in a clinical study in osteoporosis over three years between the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatinins within 10 days of the application was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the assessment of the laboratory findings, the transient asymptomatic calcium values, which were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.10 mmol / l), performed at 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Morbus Paget trials.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study to avoid clinical fractures following a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recent hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions following the administration of zoledron acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions to the infusion site such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0,7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the jaw area has been reported, especially in cancer patients, about osteonecrosis (primarily in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including Zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental procedures.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 Study with 7,736 patients showed osteonecrose in the jaw area of one with Aclasta and a patient treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In case of overdose which leads to clinically relevant hypocemia, a compensation of oral calcium and / or an intravenous calcium gluconate infusion can be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical effectiveness in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The effectiveness and safety of aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been indicated in postmenopausal women (7,736 women aged 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density (BMD) T-Score for the Schenkelhals ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebral body fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric vertebral fractures Aclasta decreased significantly over a period of three years and after one year the frequency of one or more new vertebral body fractures (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Patients aged 75 years and over had a 60% reduced risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed a constant effect over three years, which resulted in reduced risk for hip fractures at 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta significantly increased bone density on lumbar vertebrate, hip and distal radius compared with placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the entire hip by 6.0%, the lower angle by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology of 152 postmenopausal osteoporosis patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the basin.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer (µTT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume and the receipt of the trabecular bone architecture in patients treated with Aclasta compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone turnover marker The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of type-ion collagen (P1NP) in serum and the Beta-C-Telopeptid (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">Treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of aclasta significantly reduced BSAP by 30% after 12 months compared to baseline and was held at 28% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. orally or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, the Aclasta treatment increased BMD compared to placebo treatment at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">In comparison with placebo treatment, the Aclasta treatment led to an increase of the BMD by 5.4% to total fractures and 4.3% in the cervical area.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study, 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in men treated with Aclasta compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (CZOL446M2308), the annual dose of Aclasta was not inferior to the percentage change in the lumbar vertebra BMD after 24 months compared to the baseline value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment in the disease of the bone Aclasta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, especially light to moderately difficult disease Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase corresponding to the 2.6x to 3,0fold age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg zoledron acid compared to the intake of 30 mg risedronat once daily for 2 months was proved in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain strength and loss of pain was observed after 6 months compared to the baseline for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month study could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 patients with Aclasta and 107 patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response of 141 of patients with Aclasta, compared with 71 of patients treated with risedronat, was maintained at an average duration of the follow-up phase of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-off and multiple 5 and 15 minutes of persistent infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg zoledron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">Then the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long-lasting phase very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphase disappearance from the big cycle with half-life t ½ A 0,24 and t ½ to 1.87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal Eliminationshalbswertszeit t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early stages of distribution (α and β with the above t ½ -values) probably represent the rapid resorption of the bones and excretion through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 h, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearing is 5,4 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the zoledron concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearing of substances, which is metabolized by cytochrom P450 enzymes, is unlikely to be metabolized by cytochrom P450 enzymes and because it is a weak or no more direct and / or irreversible, metabolic dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Specific patient groups (see Section 4.2) correlated with the creatinin-clearing, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatine inin-clearing, and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal dysfunction down to a creatinin-Clearance up to 35 ml / min does not require any dose adjustment of the zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for severe kidney dysfunction (creatinin Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data is available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-Latvian single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0.6 mg / kg body weight in rats.</seg>
<seg id="657">In dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC) were administered 6times the recommended human-therapeutic exposure, administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerance of zoledric acid was administered in rats by taking doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose corresponding to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in cumulative expositions that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects were observed in other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, as well as the intravenous injection site.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent infection with repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphyse of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, anti-resorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed teratogenicity in dosages of 0,2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) deformities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was 0,1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels.</seg>
<seg id="663">If the medicine is not used immediately, the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledron acid is a representative of a substance called bisphosphonate and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the disease Paget of bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially oestrogen produced from androgens, play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">With the Morbus Paget, bone reconstruction takes place too fast, and new bone material is assembled unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalizing the bone reconstruction, thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus again giving strength to the bone.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, tell your doctor that you will be treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">If you are using Aclasta with other medicines please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you are taking other medicines or have used / used recently / used, even if they are non-prescription pharmaceuticals.</seg>
<seg id="677">It is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking drugs that are known to damage the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="678">When using Aclasta together with food and beverages, you are concerned that according to your doctor's instructions, you should take sufficient fluids before and after treatment with Aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="686">Before completing the treatment with Aclasta Falls if you are considering the termination of treatment with Aclasta, please make your next appointment come true and discuss this with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="687">Side effects associated with the first infusion often occur (for more than 30% of patients), but are less frequent after subsequent infusion.</seg>
<seg id="688">Fever and chills, muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public. this document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) evaluated the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients), in which metformin (a diabetes drug) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be used in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), which cannot be sufficiently adjusted with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl resin or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonyl resp or insulin can be maintained with the onset of the Actos treatment, except for those with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); this should reduce the dose of the sulfonyl alcohol or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, allowing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of actos in tripletherapy was studied; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl resin, in addition, they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">This led to a reduction in the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were lowered in the application of doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of an additional dose of acetone for existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyl resin showed a reduction in HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study investigating the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, the patients who took Actos in addition to insulin showed a reduction in HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients who took placebo in addition.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were vision disorders, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain, and hypoesthesia (decreased sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or one of the other ingredients, still in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high levels of ketone level - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where Metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a licence to the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited Company for launching Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and carry on one side the marking" "" "15" "" "and on the other side the inscription" "" "Actos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is inappropriate for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for the use of pioglitazone in patients under the age of 18, so the use in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of having at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain, and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports on heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzyme (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values must be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, superstructure complaints, tiredness, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme values must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision to continue the treatment of the patient with pioglitazone should be conducted before the clinical assessment of the laboratory parameters.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been demonstrated, which can be caused by fat deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">A minor reduction of the mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction of 4%) and haematocrits (relative reduction of 4.1%) was followed as a result of a hemodilution.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients with metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and haematocrits by 3.1-2% and haematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral dual or triple-combination therapy with a sulfonyl resin or as dual combination therapy with insulin are the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, a decrease of visual acuity was reported under treatment with thiazolid india, including pioglitazone, worsening or worsening of diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking picoglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribing doctors should be aware of the possibility of a macular edema when patients report on disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of reports of adverse events with regard to bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence amounted to 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures performed at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patients) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to be pregnant or this occurs, the treatment should be dismissed (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pioglitazone has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or drug dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines which are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a decrease of the AUC from Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that treatment with pioglitazone reduces the hyperinsulinaemia resulting from pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother's animal and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very frequently &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (cannot be estimated from available data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and refractive index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, ALT assumptions about three times the upper limit of the normal range often occurred as frequently as under placebo, but less common than in comparison groups with metformin or sulfonyl resins.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency in pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo if pioglitazone or pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, it has rarely been reported about heart failure under Pioglitazone, but more often if pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac insufficiency in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of reports of adverse events with regard to bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with pioglitazone and over 7,400 patients in patients treated with comparative medication was performed.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study, which ran over a period of 3.5 years, fractures performed at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific nuclear receptors (Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)), which leads in the animal model to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose evaluation in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Gliclacide as monotherapy continued over two years to study the time to get the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first six months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the onset of therapy, blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study for over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar had been inadequate with insulin despite three months of optimization were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients with pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, Pioglitazon showed a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinine quotients compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol as well as slightly but clinically not significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced overall plasmatriglycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or gliclacide and increased HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazone, whereas values reduced under metformin and gliclacide were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a 20-week study, Pioglitazon did not only reduce the triglyceride levels but also improved the postprandial elevated triglyceride levels, which has an effect on triglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomized to either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">According to oral application, Pioglitazone is quickly absorbed, with the peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to its effectiveness is roughly the triple of the efficacy of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">Interaction studies have demonstrated that Pioglitazone has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or drug dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to oral use of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the wood (55%) and to a lesser extent in urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination time of unaltered pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral clearance of the mother's substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">Toxicological studies were consistent with mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlarging with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric cardiac hypertrophie.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that the treatment with Pioglitazone reduces the hyperinsulinaemia resulting in the gestation and increases the insulin resistance of the mother's animal and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the bladder epithelium were induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazolid indiions led to increased frequency of colon tumours.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures performed at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patients) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with pioglitazone or Gliclacide were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, Pioglitazon showed a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinine quotients compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a 20-week study, Pioglitazon did not only reduce the triglyceride levels but also improved the postprandial elevated triglyceride levels, which has an effect on Tryglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic lacyglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study failed to determine its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortality, non-killing myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary revascularization and revascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that cardiovascular long-term risks are not associated with the intake of pioglitazone.</seg>

<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission issued a licence to the company Novo Nordisk A / S for the distribution of actraphane across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily if a rapid initial effect along with a longer lasting effect is desired.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar levels have improved dramatically, for example, by intensified insulin therapy, hypoglycaemia warning symptoms can be altered and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in terms of strength, brand (producer), type of insulin (fast acting, biphase, long acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or method of production (by recombinant DNA over insulin of animal origin) can cause a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is required when changing to Actraphane in the patient, it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients reported hypoglycaemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling, which go over several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor, as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore consider possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines they have taken.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Slow hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, which may occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetic therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemias can lead to unconsciousness and / or seizures and end with temporary or permanent brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Diseases of the nervous system Actually - Peripheral neuropathy A rapid improvement in blood sugar control can be associated with discomfort referred to as acute painful neuropathy and are usually reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5 An intensification of insulin therapy with an abrupt improvement in blood sugar setting can, however, be associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="883">Lipodystrophy At the injection site, a lipodystrophy may arise if it has been foamed to change the deposits within the injection area.</seg>
<seg id="884">General conditions and complaints at the place of delivery - Local hypersensitivity reaction at the injection site During insulin therapy, local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and hematoma can occur at the injection site).</seg>
<seg id="885">Diseases of the immune system Actually - Urticaria, Exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions symptoms of generalized hypersensitivity, including generalized rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, angioneurosis, breathing difficulties, heart palpitations, low blood pressure and powerlessness / unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="886">Hypoglycaemia may develop gradually: • Light hypoglycemia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should always have glucose, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemia with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven auxiliary person or by glucose given by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the effective maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration of the work is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of split (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were taken into consideration; none of the metabolites formed by the split are active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity in repeated applications, genotoxicity, the carcinogenic potential and the reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after the Actraphane screw bottle has been removed from the refrigerator - to get the temperature of the insulin at room temperature (not above 25 ° C) before it is resuspended according to the manual for the first use.</seg>
<seg id="893">Some patients reported hypoglycaemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="894">The doctor must therefore consider possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines they have taken.</seg>

<seg id="896">13 An intensification of insulin therapy with an abrupt improvement in blood sugar setting can, however, be associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="897">The terminale half-life time (t ½) is therefore rather a measure of resorption as a measure of the elimination per se of insulin from the plasma (insulin has a t ½ of a few minutes in the bloodstream).</seg>

<seg id="1175">In the first study, 48% (126 of 262) of patients who took Adenuric in a dose of once daily 80 mg, and 65% (175 of 269) of patients who once received 120 mg once daily, had a uric acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1176">In comparison, this was 22% (60 out of 268) of patients under Allopurinol and none of the 134 patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of adenuric (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headache, diarrhea, nausea (nausea), rash and abnormal liver values.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Especially in patients with heart problems in prehistory, there may be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Adenuric was more effective in lowering the uric acid level in the blood than allopurinol, but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1180">Treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia in the case of diseases that have already led to urate deposits (including a gout node known from the medical history and / or gout arthritis).</seg>
<seg id="1181">If the serum acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) after 2-4 weeks, a dose increase can be taken into account on the ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1182">In patients with severe kidney function, efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated (creatinin Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min, see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1183">Children and adolescents, since there is no experience in children and adolescents, is not recommended to use febuxostat in this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Since there are no experiences in organ transplant recipients, the application of Febuxostat is not recommended in this patient group (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1185">Cardiovascular diseases In patients with ischemic heart disease or chronic heart failure, the treatment with Febuxostat is not recommended (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1186">As with other resin-based medicines, an acute attack can occur during the course of treatment, because it is possible to mobilize uric acid deposits in the tissue by lowering the serum acid level.</seg>
<seg id="1187">B. in malignant diseases and their treatment (Lesch- Nyhan's syndrome), the absolute concentration of Xanthin in the urine in rare cases is so far that it comes to a storage in the urinary tract.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Liver disease During phase 3 clinical trials, slight conspicuities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with Febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before the start of the febuxotherapy treatment and in the course of further development (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophyline was not performed any interaction studies to Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO inhibition can lead to an increase in theophylline level (a hibition of the metabolism of theophyline was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects the simultaneous administration of Febuxostat and naproxen was associated with an increase in Febuxostatexposition (Cmax 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical studies, the application of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorothazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicine or Indometacin without a dose adjustment for febuxostat or the other active ingredient applied at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study with subjects 120 mg ADENURIC 1 x daily showed an average 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substratum, indicating a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an antacid, the magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide, delayed the intake of Febuxostat (about 1 hour) and causes a decrease of the Cmax by 32%, but no significant change in the AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregnancies do not cause side effects of febuxostat to the pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle, operating machines or exercising hazardous activities until they can reasonably be sure that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerical higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported by the investigator was observed in the total febuxostatory group in the pivotal study of Phase 3 (1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years) and in long-term extensions (1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal connection with febuxostat could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors determined by these patients were an arteriosclerotic disease and / or a myocardial infarction or a decompensated congestive heart failure in the medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) and rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1.000) side effects, which could be present in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of Febuxostat and which have been reported in all Febuxostat treatment groups more than once, are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are simultaneously treated with colchicin. * * In clinical studies, severe skin rashes or serious hypersensitivity reactions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1203">In the open long-term extension studies, 906 patients were treated for up to 1 year, 322 patients for up to 2 years, 57 patients for up to 3 years and 53 patients with febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg treated for up to 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1204">The related events reported during the long-term extension studies were similar to those reported in phase 3 studies (see Table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported in all Febuxostat treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term renewal studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patient years), according to the indications occasionally.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported in the pivotal studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, insomnia, hypaesthesia, conspicuous ECG, cough, shortness of appetite, skin discoloration, renal insufficiency, erectile dysfunction, increase in the concentration of calcium in the blood, decrease of lymphocytes, decrease in the number of white blood cells.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The active mechanism of uric acid is the final product of the purinmetabolism in humans and arises as part of the hypoxanthin reaction cascade → Xanthin → uric acid.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Febuxostat is a potent, non-Purin-selective inhibitor of the XO (NP-SIxO) with a Ki-value for in vitro inhibition that lies below the nanomolar range.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Clinical trial results The efficacy of ADENURIC was shown in two pivotal studies of phase 3 (APEX study and FACT study as described below), which were performed with 1,832 patients with hyperuricaemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">The primary efficacy endpoint in each study was the proportion of patients with the last three monthly serum levels &lt; 6,0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="1212">Placebo (n = 134), ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 134) or Allopurinol 300 mg 1 x daily (n = 10) for patients with a serum increment value at the start of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1213">The APEX study showed the statistically significant superiority of both the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily and ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conventionally used doses of allopurinol 300 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).</seg>
<seg id="1214">The FACT study showed the statistically significant superiority of both the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily and ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the conventionally used dose of allopurinol 300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Patients with serum creatinine values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl) or 300 mg 1 x daily (n = 509) were combined for the analysis. * p &lt; 0,001 versus Allopurinol, # p &lt; 0.001 versus 80 mg</seg>
<seg id="1216">The lowering of the serum acid level to &lt; 6,0 mg / dl (357 µl / l) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and maintained permanently throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">509 patients received allopurinol 300 mg 1 x a day; 10 patients with serum creatinine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x a day.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with kidney function restriction The APEX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction (ie).</seg>
<seg id="1219">With ADENURIC, the primary efficacy endpoint was 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage regression of the serum resin concentrations in subjects, despite their kidney function (58% in the group with normal renal function and 55% in the group with severe kidney function disorders).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum resin concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl Etwa 40% of patients (APEX- and FACT study) had a serum-acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study (baseline).</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the serum acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of rheumatism, so that less than 3% of patients required treatment against a gout in the months 16-24 (i.e. more than 97% of the patients needed no treatment against a gout).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction of the gout node size, which resulted in a complete disappearance of the lymph nodes up to 24% in 54% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Elevated TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients receiving long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients who received allopurinol (5.8%) in open long-term extension studies (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of Febuxostat increased proportionally from 10 mg to 120 mg dose dose after administration.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses of between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in the AUC is observed for Febuxostat which is larger than the dosisproportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day, the Cmax is 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change was observed in the percentage drop in the serum acid concentration provided this was checked (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent loss-state distribution volume (Vss / F) of Febuxostat is between 29 and 75 l after intake of doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasma protein binding of Febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primary binding of albumin) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1231">In vitro studies in human liver microsomes, these oxidative metabolites are predominantly formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostatglucuronid mainly results from UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After intake of an 80 mg dose of 14C-markedly Febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose in the urine was found to be unmodified foebuxostat (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) and other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion over urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the chair was found as unaltered basebuxostat (12%), acetylglukuronid of the active substance (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%) and as yet unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">Special patient groups kidney failure After intake of multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe kidney failure, the Cmax of Febuxostat did not change in proportion to subjects with normal renal function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The mean total AUC of Febuxostat increased by approximately 1.8 times of 7.5 m g / ml in the group with normal renal function at 13.2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1236">12 liver function restriction After intake multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (Child- Pugh classification A) or moderate (Child-Pugh classification B) Liver restriction did not significantly change the Cmax and AUC of Febuxostat and its metabolites significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Age There were no significant changes in the AUC of Febuxostat or its metabolites after taking multiple oral doses of ADENURIC in older patients compared to younger subjects.</seg>
<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In male rats, a statistically significant increase in urinary bladder tumors (transition cell papillomas and carcinomas) was found only in connection with xanthin stones in the highly dosed treated group, with approximately 11 times the exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of a specific purinatory metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It has been found that febuxostat in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats.</seg>
<seg id="1241">At high doses, which were about 3 times the human therapeutic exposure, maternal toxicity occurred, accompanied by a reduction of the increase in expenditure and a developmental delay in the offspring of rats.</seg>
<seg id="1242">Teratological studies in carrying cases with expositions, approximately 4,3 times and in carrying rabbits with expositions, which amounted to about 13 times the human therapeutic exposure, did not result in teratogenic effects.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorothazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicine or Indometacin without a dose adjustment for febuxostat or the other active ingredient applied at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you keep the uric acid concentration down by the 1 x daily intake of ADENURIC, the crystal formation is prevented and in this way a reduction of the discomfort is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="1256">ADENURIC may not be taken if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredient Febuxostat or any of the other components of ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Tell your doctor before you start taking this medicine, • if you have a heart weakness or have or suffer from any other heart problem. • if you are treated because of a high uric acid concentration in a result of cancer or the Lesch-Nyhan-syndrome (a rare inborn condition in which too much uric acid is found in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="1258">If you have a gout attack at the moment (sudden appearance of severe pain, pressure sensitivity, redness, feeling of warmth and joint swelling), wait until the attack is cleared before starting with ADENURIC treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1259">This does not have to be the case with everyone, but may also occur with you, especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months, if you take ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1260">Your doctor will prescribe other medicines if necessary to prevent a gout or to treat the associated symptoms (such as pain and joint swelling).</seg>
<seg id="1261">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or have used / used recently / used, even if they are non-prescription pharmaceuticals.</seg>
<seg id="1262">It is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use / use one of the following substances as interactions with ADENURIC may occur and your doctor may possibly consider necessary measures. • Mercaptopurine (for the treatment of cancer) • theophyline (for the treatment of asthma) • Warfarin (for the dilution of heart disease)</seg>
<seg id="1263">There were no studies on the impact of ADENURIC on the traffic airiness and the ability to operate machines.</seg>

<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines approved in the European Union, the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to prove the efficacy of ADROVANCE in terms of increasing the vitamin D level.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in the patients treated with ADROVANCE was less (11%) than those who only received alendronate (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data suggesting that the alendronate dose contained in ADROVANCE corresponds exactly to the dose required to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headaches, musculoskeletal pain, dyspepsia (digestive disorders), constipation, diarrhea (diarrhea), constipation, diarrhea (ulcera), esophagus, dysphagia (swallowing), inflated abdomen (inflated abdomen) as well as acidic impact.</seg>
<seg id="1283">ADROVANCE may not be used in patients with any hypersensitivity (allergy) against alendronate, vitamin D3, or any of the other ingredients.</seg>

<seg id="1291">Esophageal responses, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal strokes, were reported in patients taking alendronate (partially these were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible esophageal reactions, and the patients should be advised to stop the medicine at the occurrence of symptoms of esophageal irritation such as dysphagia, pain in swallowing or retroviral pain or new or worsening heartburn (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3. the risk of severe esophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue to take it after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">Whereas in large-scale clinical studies with alendronate no increased risk was detected, stomach and duodenalulcera (after market introduction) were rarely reported (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteoarthritis of the jaw usually associated with tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteomyelitis) was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regimen mainly intravenously administered bisphosphonates.</seg>

<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting the metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be treated adequately before starting therapy with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines can affect the resorption of alendronate when taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, after taking alendronate, patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not carried out, alendronate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines, without clinically relevant interactions occurring.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is only intended for use in postmenopausal women and is not to be applied either during pregnancy or by breastfeeding women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate leave no indication of directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>

<seg id="1403">In addition, the results of a clinical study were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplantation, and the application of Advagraf with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin was compared.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was rejected after a treatment duration of one year (for example, by examining how often a new organ transplant or resumption of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter further studies were conducted on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplant and examined how Advagraf is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including hypoimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and daily dosage; changes in the formulation or regime should only be performed under close-meshed control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a consequence of switching to an alternative formulation, therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood level provisions (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus-Talmirrors should be controlled before the changeover and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On day 4, systemic exposure, measured as a level mirror, was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of tacrolimus dorsal levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post-transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since tacrolimus is a substance with low clearance, an adjustment of the advance dose can take several days before the Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of the application to suppress the transplant rejection must be maintained by immunosuppression; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dose recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advagraf therapy should begin with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Other dosage adjustments may be necessary later, as the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can change in the course of the patient's stabilization after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplantation prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advagraf therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - switch from Prograf to Advagraf must have a transplant receiver of twice daily dose of Prograf capsules to be converted to a once daily intake of Advagraf, so this conversion has to take place in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplants After switching from other immunosuppressants to Advagraf once a day, the treatment must begin with the oral initials recommended in kidney and liver transplants for prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant in adult patients who are converted to Advagraf is an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day to be taken once daily in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Although there are no clinical experience with Advagraf in lung, pankreas- and bowel transplanted patients, patients in lung transplant transplanted patients were treated at an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and for intestinal transplant recipients at an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adaptations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood levels in the targeted area, a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of kidney function (including a regular determination of the serum creatine level, a calculation of the creatine inin duct and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switch from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When switching from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy caution is advised (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerance in an individual case taking the aid of whole blood Tacrolimus-Talspiegel controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent control of tacrolimus dorsal levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Tacrolimus blood levels should also be controlled after conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, Dosage adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or while using substances that could alter the tacrolimus blood concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low clearance, adjustments to the dose may require several days until the Steady State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the levels of tacrolimus dorrolimus in whole blood are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in case of kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">Blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has resulted in serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects that may occur as a result of tacrolimus under or over-exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and daily dosage; changes in the formulation or regime should only be performed under close-meshed control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 There are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation of Advagraf for the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which has proven to be a therapy resistant to other immunosuppressants.</seg>
<seg id="1442">There are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation of Advagraf to prevent transplant rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and graft recipients in childhood.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions, which may lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus's blood and weakening the clinical effect of tacrolimus, taking herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), or other plant remedies during a treatment with Advagraf (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is offered as the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, a corneal or septum hypertrophie described as cardiomyopathy was observed under Prograf, which can therefore occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver dysfunction, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin lesions due to appropriate clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who are taking Tacrolimus, symptoms for PRES such as headaches, altered state of consciousness, cramps and visual disturbances, should be a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels combined with simultaneous administration of substances that can alter the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the tacrolimus dose to maintain uniform concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as it is used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Tacrolimus effect on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 can impair their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thereby increase the exposure of hormones, it is particularly appropriate to act cautiously in decisions on contraceptive measures.</seg>

<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, tacrolimus can not be dialyzed.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Action mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects On a molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus are mediated through its binding to a cytosolic protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for the enrichment of the connection in the cellular interior.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a specific number of lymphocykin genes.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the unbound fraction of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism induced by treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby excretion takes place mainly through the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advagraf was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf in stable patients treated by Prograf (twice a day) to Advagraf (mg: mg) in relation to the total daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advocate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Advate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor of VIII deficiency, causing blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced using a method called "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) is inserted that enables it to form the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the use of the drug for preventing bleeding and surgical procedures was examined.</seg>

<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human clotting factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission issued a licence to the Baxter AG company for placing Advate in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, the location and the degree of bleeding and the patient's clinical condition.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the case of the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not drop below the specified plasma levels (in% of the standard or I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the danger for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">In the course of treatment, appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma level is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of the injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII, perform various in vivo recovery and have different half-life times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prevention for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg of body weight at intervals of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not reached or if the hemorrhage is not controlled with an adequate dose, a test must be performed in order to detect an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of administration should depend on the patient's condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII directed IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma via modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure stage is the largest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnestic known inhibitors development, a recombinant factor of VIII product was observed after switching from a recombinant factor VIII to another, the reemergence of (low-tidy) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibitors of factor VIII (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients with higher risk of forming inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial authorisation, the CHMP continues to evaluate the benefits risk weighing as positive, but considering that the safety profile needs to be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which necessitates a filing of PSURs every 6 months, the CHMP decided to apply for further extension procedures in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited granted the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) officially that the company withdraws its application for approval for the inplacing of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Usually, however, breast, brain, bone or soft tissue (tissues that connect and support other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is a" "" "Adenovirus" "", "which has been modified to produce no copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and thus allow the cancer cells to form the normal p53-protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53-protein, which is formed from the non-defective gene in the human body, normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In the case of Li-Fraumeni-cancer, where the p53-gene is defective, the p53-protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can grow further and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient who joined the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the abdominal area, the bones and the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP checked the company's responses to the questions he asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initially submitted documents, the CHMP will create a list of questions sent to the company on day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">The CHMP opinion has not been sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin's injection in Li-Fraumeni tumors brings benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be established in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not know whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or "compassionate use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "modified ingredient release" "" "means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other is slowly released over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal passages caused by an allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosa swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents 12 years old, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice a day a tablet, which should be taken with or without food with a glass of water.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are sounded.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measures were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed with a standard scale how severe the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms except constipation of the nose, the patients reported that the aerinaze decreased by 46.0%, compared with 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under Aeropaze showed a relief of 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients receiving desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chasing), oral dry, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic substances or loratadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze must also not be used in patients suffering from a narrow angle glaucoma (hypertension), heart or vascular diseases including hypertension (hyperthyroemia), hyperthyroidissis (hyperthyroidism), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyroitis), or a risk of haemorrhaging stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a licence to the Company SP Europe for launching Aeropaze on the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it is swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking, crushing or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under the age of 12 due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days, as long-term application can reduce the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After a decrease in the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory passages, the treatment can be continued with disloratadin as monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergolid, liihydroergotamine or other deongestiva, which can be performed orally or nasally as an abnormal rhinologic agent (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, nhazolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient population and the data is not sufficient to pronounce appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients need to be informed that the treatment must be stopped in case of hypertension or a tachycardia or of palpitations, cardiac arrhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or headaches).</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • patients with myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder obstruction or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, as antihistamines otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with disloratadin, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of loratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between those treated with loratadin and the patients treated with placebo regardless of whether or not a loratadin was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of loratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit in-vivo CYP3A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, but experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to drowsiness which may lead to impairment of traffic airtightness or the ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanose, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremolor, convulsions) with possible letterings.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, difficult miction, muscular weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, precordial pain, vertigo, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupillary dire and - dilatation, skin redness, hyperthermia, and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the hibition of expression of the adhesion molecule P-Selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, there was no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of CNS excitation.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years took part in seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonistic efficacy of aerinaze tablets was significantly higher compared to the overall standby for the symptoms (except for nasal mucosa), significantly higher than under monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to patient sub-groups according to sex, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the course of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, desloratadin is detectable in plasma within 30 minutes after administration.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the body weight of loratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the scope of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects of Desloratadin were poorly metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the ubiquitous application of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was for exposure after administration of an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety macropology, toxicity in repeated applications, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with disloratadin do not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive-toxicological studies the combination of lauatadin / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral dosage of rats at a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and to rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and the pharmaceutical covigilance system described in Module 1.8.1 of the Authorisation Application is and works before and during the product on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the relief of allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, its effect.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if the following symptoms or illnesses occur or are diagnosed at the use of aerinaze: • high blood pressure • heartbeat, palpitations, heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headaches or a strengthening of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">If you are taking Aeropaze with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is non-prescription pharmaceuticals.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Transport and loading of machines When used in the recommended dosage, it is not expected that aerinaze results in drowsiness or decreases the attention.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the launch of Desloratadin, very rarely reported cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rashes.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, heart chasing, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disturbances, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, about cases of inflammation of the liver and cases of conspicuous liver values has also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as 5 mg tablet, 5 mg / lyophilia for intake (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg- and 5 mg. melt tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children between one and five years, the dose amounts to 1.25 mg once a day, which is expressed in the form of 2.5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children between six and eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies involving approximately 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four trials of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies of patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Efficacy was measured by identifying the symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrangles, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to demonstrate that the body uses the syrup, the solution for the intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease of the symptom (number of symptoms) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies at Urticaria the decrease of the symptom scores after six weeks was treated with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared with 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Erius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to loratadin, loratadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a licence to the company SP Europe for the launching of Aerius in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies to the efficacy of young people aged 12 to 17 (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the clinical course of the disease and may be terminated after the symptoms have disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In case of persistent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) the patient may be recommended during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with disloratadin tablets in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, while taking Aerius and alcohol, the performance reduction effect of alcohol was not increased (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to drowsiness which may lead to impairment of traffic airtightness or the ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were tiredness (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study involving 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headaches, which occurred in 5.9% of the patients treated with casebo and 6.9% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study, administered up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecule P-Selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses in which the patient was administered daily for 14 days in a dose of up to 20 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg. a day (which is nine times the clinical dose) over ten days, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be divided in dependence on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Allergic rhinitis are defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the overall core of the questionnaire for quality of life of Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Chronic idiopathic urticaria was studied for further forms of the Urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, regardless of the etiology of the different forms, is similar and chronic patients can easily be recruited prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As histamine release is a causative factor in all urticarial diseases, it is expected that in addition to chronic idiopathic urticaria, in other forms of the Urticaria, the symptoms are improved; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the study was excluded from the study by the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in the itching rate by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with loratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and alertness, as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study in which the patient demos were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of the patients achieved a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulation after daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of loratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1758">In vivo, Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies performed with Desloratadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety macropology, toxicity in repeated applications, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with disloratadin do not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Erius can be taken separately from meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years of age are caused by infection (see section 4.4) and there are no data available that support a treatment of an infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical abnormalities, the anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are metabolized with loratadin and experience a higher endurance load (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children aged between 2 and 11, which is fully metabolized, is identical to that of children who metabolise normal.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or sucrose-isomaltal insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Aerius tablets in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol, the performance reduction effect of alcohol was not increased (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children aged between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius syrup group as in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, the recommended dose reported 3% more adverse events in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 years of age who were eligible for an antihistamine therapy received a daily average dose of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of disloratadin in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of Desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In the context of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in which desloratadin was used daily for 14 days in a dose of up to 20 mg, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in the desloratadin in a dosage of 45 mg daily (which is nine times the clinical dose) applied for ten days in adults, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents, there was no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">At a single-day dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials led to no impairment of psychomotoric.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical pharmacological studies in adults, the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not cause an increase in alcohol induced performance impairment or increase of drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As shown on the overall core of the questionnaire to quality of life of Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduce the rhinitis caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The circulation of this restrictive phenotype was similar to adults (6%) and children aged between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations bigger with blacks (18% adults, 16% children) than in Caucasia (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with the syrup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which are fully metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) by Desloratadin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the Cmax is about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-time of approximately 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no indications for clinically relevant active substance cumulation after daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) for 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In various single dose studies, AUC and Cmax values of disloratadin were comparable to paediatric patients in the recommended doses compared to those of adults who received desloratadin syrup in a dose of 5 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that is intended to protect from a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from man to person, because humans have not yet built up immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "after administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as" "" "foreign" "" "and forms antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is later able to produce antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognises as a foreign body), was cleaned up and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="1903">For further information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who are unable to swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution to intake, but this cannot be taken together with Ritsavir, as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It should only be ascertained once the doctor has checked what antiviral medicines the patient has previously taken and the likelihood of the virus to be addressed to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100mg kritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of adrenalin depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Aging in combination with other antiviral medicines reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Aids cannot cure AIDS, but can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of HIV-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was investigated in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without kritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV infected adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">In 206 adults who had previously taken proteasehemence, the medicine used with low-dosed kritonavir was compared to other protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with undocumented levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously taken no protease inhibitors, more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than placebo after 48 weeks, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenase also reduced the viral load, but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors had only very few responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the use of kritonavir increased the viral load after 16-week treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other proteasinhibitors, it combined with kritonavir to a stronger drop in the viral load after four weeks as in the patients receiving their former proteasehemently:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), nausea, nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to ambleavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">It may also not be used in patients who use St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines that are degraded as well as agrease and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who are taking ageneral are the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (death of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the rejuvenating immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of agrease in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years were predominant in comparison with the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritsavir, but the committee found that the benefits of agrease in combination with ritonavir in patients who previously had not taken protease inhibitors were not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a licence to the company Glaxo Group Limited for placing asrease in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, proteasinhibitor (PI) -previously treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Generally, Agenerase capsules are supposed to be administered for pharmacokinetic booster of ambleavir along with low doses of kritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amprenavir should take account of the individual viral resistance pattern and the patient's pre-treatment (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% less than the capsule; therefore, agrease capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg amprenavir twice a day together with 100 mg kritonavir twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the addition of kritonavir (booster), higher doses of agrease (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a day-to-day dose of 2400 mg amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of kritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Ageneral is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be carried out with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent the mediums of the cytochrome P450-isotherenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Vegetable preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of ambleavir while taking Amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that it may continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with agenase, does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Generally, Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of kritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing liver function including chronic hepatitis indicate an increased incidence of liver dysfunction in antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of agrease and ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids, which are metabolized by CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of astatin with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (controlled by the International Norised Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who use these drugs at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective due to the reduced plasma level of ambleavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amateavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amponavir, patients should be monitored on oppiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of kritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under the age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Aging should be set to 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients who received antiretroviral therapy including proteasinhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases that were needed to treat medications associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug dependent factors, such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In the case of hemmophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase in hemorrhage including spontaneous cutaneous hematoma and hemorrhasis occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV infected patients with severe immune defect, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multi-factorial ethology is assumed (including corticosteroids, alcohol intake, heavy immunosuppression, higher body mass index), osteonnecrosis cases were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width are not allowed at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent the mediums of the cytochrome P450-isotherenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with kritonavir must not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are metabolized predominantly via CYP2D6 and are linked to increased plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the lower plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with ritonavir, undesirable effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already receives St. John's wort, the amblevirus mirrors and, if possible, check the viral load and suspend the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when Nelspruavir is administered with amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, for Cmax on the other hand reduced by 30% if kritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg amprenavir have been applied twice daily and kritonavir 100 mg twice daily to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if amprenavir (750 mg twice a day) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice a day).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice a day), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if amponavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, but close monitoring is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There has been no pharmacokinetic study on the use of didanosine in combination with Didanosin, but due to the antazial component of Didanosin it is recommended that the revenues of Didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see anttazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with ambleavir (600 mg twice a day) and ritonavir (100 mg twice a day), dosage adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with ambleavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both proteasinhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and available limited data suggest that Nevirapin may lower the serum concentration of Ambleavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used at the same time, caution is advisable as Delavirdin might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these medicines are used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out, as precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on delavirine is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous addition of Amprenavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in the plasma concentration (AUC) of Rifabutin by 193% and thus to an increase in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dose of rifabutin is recommended to at least half the recommended dose, although there is no clinical data available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies in combination with erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of 700 mg Fosamrenavir and 100 mg Ritonavir with 200 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in the Cmax of ketoconazol in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to the 2.69fold compared to the value observed once daily with no simultaneous use of Fosamrenavir with kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including mediums, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may also interact with Agenerase, possibly causing interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with agrease.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on data from other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as ageneral, as it can cause resorption problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anti-convulsants known as enzyme inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with Ambleavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma level of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum levels of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipin, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipin, Nicardipin, Nifedipin, Nimodipine, Nisoldipin and Verapamil can be increased 10 by means of amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake of atherosclerosis can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen the side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which kritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma level increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous addition of Agenerase with ritonavir is not recommended along with these glucocorticoids unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">With HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is highly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in the plasma level can be expected with simultaneous administration of atherosclerosis.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these pharmaceuticals is not recommended with amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirror is recommended since the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, Rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous administration of ambleavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase must not be used together with oral midazolam (see section 4.3), while the use of Agenerase with parenteral Midazolam is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on the simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other proteaseininhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Midazolam by 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered along with amponavir, patients should therefore be monitored on oppiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of kritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the inherently low reliability of historic comparisons, no recommendation can be given at the moment, such as the amponavir dose if ambleavir is administered with methadone at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In combination with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with agrease, increased control of INR (International Norised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of attenuation or amplification of antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional dose of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramin and Nortryptilin) is recommended with simultaneous administration of agenase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother when compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Amponavir-related substances have been proven in the milk of lactating rats, but it is not known if amprenavir passes into breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the intrusion into the uterus until the end of the breastfeeding period, showed a reduced increase in the 12 body weight during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Further development of the seed, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of Amprenavir to the mother's animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of agenase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most adverse events associated with the Agenase treatment were mild to moderate, occurred early and rarely led to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">For many of these events, it is not clear whether they are in connection with taking Agenerase or another medicine applied to the HIV treatment, or if they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg of agenase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4) assessed by investigators as in connection with study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as any changes in the treatment (Grade 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and fetal subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsocervical fat accumulation (stitching).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretrovirally not pre-treated people who had been treated with ambleavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine for a median duration of 36 weeks, only one case (stitching) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 in 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients with Amprenavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients with indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a median duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes usually were mild to moderately pronounced, erythematous or maculopapulous nature, with or without itching and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with ambleavir had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteonnecrosis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">At the time of initiation of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), HIV infected patients with severe immune defect may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients receiving 600 mg of adrenalin twice a day together with low dosed ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of adverse events (Grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable to those who received high doses of triglyceride and CPK values in patients who received aggenerase together with low-dosed ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient can observe signs of an intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">It binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the process of viral gag and gag poly protections with the result of a formation of unmature, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of ambleavir in vitro versus HIV-1 IIIB was examined both in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of Ambleavir lies in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans has not yet been defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamrenavir / ritonavir dosages - as with other Ritsavir Boostinated Treatment Scas with Proteaseininhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Sixteen of 434 antiretroviral non-treated patients who received 700mg Fosamrenavir with 100mg Ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, with 14 isolates being genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 out of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 encapsulated patients with protease inhibitors, showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, G48V, I50V, I54L / M / T / V, Q58E, D60E, I62A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamrenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice a day: n = 107) patients treated with protease inhibitors performed in patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Analysis systems based on genotypic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of ambleavir / ritonavir or Fosamrenavir / Ritsavir in patients with protease inhibitors resistant insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamrenavir / Ritsavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, I62V, V82A / C / F / M, I84V and L90M combined with increased phenotypic resistance to fossil avir and a reduced likelihood of a virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for analyzing the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypic resistance testing, clinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with genotypic data for assessing the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or Fosamrenavir / Ritsavir in patients with protease inhibitors resistant insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genetic patterns associated with a reduced sensitivity to amateavir creates a certain cross-resistance against kritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remain in general.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data about cross-resistance between Amprenavir and other proteasinhibitors for all 4 Fosatrenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral non-treated patients, in which a Fosamrenavir (three out of 25 isolates), indinavir / ritonavir (three out of 25 isolates), indinavir / ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three out of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir (four out of 24 isolates) appear.</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other proteasinhibitor-resistant insulates; the preservation of this activity appears to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early termination of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits that can affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the effectiveness of Agenerase in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, in which with PI pretreated adult after virological failure (100 mg twice daily) and Nukleosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly used with low-dose kritonavir.

<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven sensitivity to Agenase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the partial study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-supremacy of APV / Ritonavir in response to the time-adjusted mean change from baseline (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-level threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of Ungeboostertem Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV infected children between 2 and 18 years of age, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>

<seg id="2044">508% increased, for Cmax on the other hand reduced by 30% if kritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">Administration of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be locked into the tissue by a large distribution volume as well as an unobstructed penetration of the blood stream into the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of unbound Amprenavir, which represents the active part, is likely to remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound Amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components fluctuates during the dosing interval depending on the overall drug concentration in the steady state over the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or present a CYP3A4 substrate should be administered cautiously if they are given at the same time with agenase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The addition of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily pre-explosion-exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambleavir is made from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase Solution and Agenerase Capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal Clearance of Ritsavir is negligible, therefore the effect of kidney dysfunction may be low on the elimination of ambleavir and ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These regimens show Amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those obtained from healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg amprenavir twice a day without simultaneous oral treatment of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies for carcinogenicity of mice and rats, hepatogenic adenomas in male animals occurred in dosages, corresponding to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8-fold (rat) of the exposure on humans, after twice daily administration of 1200 mg amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">The present exposure data on humans, both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications, showed little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vitro and in-vitro genotoxity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation test (Ames-Test), mouse lymphom test, microkernel test on rats and chromosomal aberrations on human peripheral lymphocytes, amprenavir was neither mutagen nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proved in a clinical routine by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">So far, no significant liver toxicity in patients has been observed in clinical trials, neither during the administration of agenase or after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in young animals treated with age of 4 days showed a high mortality both in the control animals and the animals treated with amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">Systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly lower (rabbit) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure in humans, were observed, however, a number of minor changes including thymus prolongation and minor skeletal changes that indicate delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the addition of kritonavir (booster), higher doses of agrease (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a day-to-day dose of 2400 mg amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be carried out with caution in patients with weak or mild cases of liver function, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants, and warfarin (controlled by the International Norised Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Aging should be set to 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk of lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors, such as higher age, and with drug dependent factors such as a prolonged anti-retroviral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2070">508% increased, for Cmax on the other hand reduced by 30% if kritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice a day), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if amponavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, but close monitoring is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with ambleavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both proteasinhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these medicines are used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out, as precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on delavirine is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dose is 31, although there are no clinical data available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Serum levels of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipin, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipin, Nicardipin, Nifedipin, Nimodipine, Nisoldipin and Verapamil can be increased by amponhole, which may increase the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in which kritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma level increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">In combination with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with agrease, increased control of INR (International Norised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of attenuation or amplification of antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg of ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg Norethindron) led to a decrease in AUC and Cmin of Amprenavir by 22%, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2080">During pregnancy, this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother when compared to the potential risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2081">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the intrusion into the uterus until the end of the lactation period of Amprenavir, showed a reduced increase in weight during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2082">The harmlessness of agenase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2083">In case of overdose, the patient can observe signs of an intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of ambleavir in vitro versus HIV-1 IIIB was examined both in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of Ambleavir lies in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Conversely, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other proteasinhibitor-resistant insulates; the preservation of this activity appears to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on these data, the benefits of "unboosterly" agenerase should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre-treated children.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While the absolute concentration of unbound Amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components fluctuates during the dosing interval depending on the overall drug concentration in the steady state over the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or present a CYP3A4 substrate should be administered cautiously if they are given at the same time with agenase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2090">Also, the renal Clearance of Ritsavir is negligible; therefore, the effect of kidney dysfunction should be low on the elimination of ambleavir and ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2091">In long-term studies for carcinogenicity of mice and rats, hepatellular adenomas in male animals occurred in dosages which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8-fold (rat) of the exposure on humans after twice daily administration of 1200 mg amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatozelular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2093">However, there is little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data to humans, both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application.</seg>
<seg id="2094">In a standard battery of in-vitro and in-vitro genotoxity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation test (Ames-Test), mouse lymphom test, microkernel test for rats and chromosomal aberrations in human peripheral lymphocytes, amprenavir was neither mutagen nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Studies on toxicity in young animals treated with age of 4 days showed a high mortality both in the control animals and the animals treated with amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="2096">These results suggest that in juvenile the metabolism paths are not yet fully developed, so that Amprenavir or other critical components of the formulation (z) are.</seg>
<seg id="2097">Agenerase's solution to intake is shown in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, proteasinhibitor (PI) -previously treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="2098">The benefit of using kritonavir "Boosterter" Agenerase solution was neither shown in patients treated with PI nor with PI previously treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="2099">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% less than the capsule; therefore, agrease capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2100">Patients should, once they are able to swallow the capsules, stop taking the solution to take away (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2101">The recommended dose for Agenerase solution is 17 mg (1.1 ml) Amprenavir / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a day-to-day dose of 2800 mg amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2102">In addition, since there is no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of asrease solution to intake and low-dosed kritonavir, this combination can be avoided in these patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Although dose adjustment for Amprenavir is not deemed necessary, an application of agenerase solution is contraindicated in patients with renal failure (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2104">Due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a consequence of the high propylene glycol content, Agenerase is contraindicated in pregnant women, in pregnant women, in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2105">Simultaneous oral administration may result in a competitive inhibition of the metabolism of these medicines and may cause serious and / or life-threatening side effects like heart rhythm disorders (z).</seg>
<seg id="2106">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that it will continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="2107">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with agenase, does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Some medicines that cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (controlled by the International Norised Ratio) are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Agrease should be stopped for a long time if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2110">An increased risk of lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors, such as higher age, and with drug 49 dependent factors such as a prolonged anti-retroviral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2111">In the case of hemmophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase in hemorrhage including spontaneous cutaneous hematoma and hemorrhasis occur.</seg>
<seg id="2112">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2113">508% increased, for Cmax on the other hand reduced by 30% if kritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2114">Simultaneous intake with ageneral can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and result in PDE5 inhibitors associated with side effects including hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2115">Based on data on 54 other CYP3A4 inhibitors, Midazolam's significant plasma concentrations are expected based on the oral administration of Midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="2116">The potential risk for humans is unknown. due to possible toxic reactions of the fetus, Agenerase's solution to intake may not be applied to the included propylene glycol during pregnancy (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2117">Amponavir-related substances have been proven in the milk of lactating rats, but it is not known if amprenavir passes into breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2118">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the intrusion into the uterus until the end of the lactation period of Amprenavir, showed a reduced increase in the 55 body weight during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2119">The harmlessness of agenase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2120">For many of these events, it is not clear whether they are in connection with taking Agenerase or another medicine applied to the HIV treatment, or if they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamrenavir / ritonavir dosages - as with other Ritsavir Boostinated Treatment Scas with Proteaseininhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>

<seg id="2174">The application frequency and duration of treatment with aldara depend on the disease to be treated: • Aldara must be applied three times a week for six weeks. • In case of small basal cell carcinomas, the cream can be applied five times a week during one or two four weeks of treatment, with four weeks of pause between treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Before bedtime, the cream is diluted to the affected areas of the skin, so that it stays on the skin for long (about eight hours) before being washed away.</seg>
<seg id="2176">In all studies Aldara was compared with a placebo (the same cream, but without the active ingredient). • Aldara was tested in four main studies of 923 patients with warts in the genital area for 16 weeks each.</seg>
<seg id="2177">The main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated warts. • Aldara was also examined in 724 patients with small basal cell carcinomas in two studies, in which patients were treated for six weeks and aldara or placebo applied either daily or five times a week.</seg>
<seg id="2178">The main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tumors after 12 weeks. • Aldara was also tested in two studies on a total of 505 patients with actinial keratoses.</seg>
<seg id="2179">In all studies, Aldara was more effective than placebo. the total treatment rate in all four main studies was 15% to 52% in patients treated with aldara, but only 3% to 18% in patients treated with placebo. • The results of the two studies on basal cell carcinomas showed a complete healing rate of 66% to 80% in patients treated with aldara compared to 0% to 3% in the placebo group.</seg>

<seg id="2184">An interruption in the treatment course described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur (see section 4.4) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area.</seg>
<seg id="2185">If follow-up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period, the treated lesions are only incompletely healed, another therapy should be started (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2186">If a dose is omitted, the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Apply imiquimod cream in a thin layer and rub in the purified, infected skin area until the cream is fully absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="2188">It should take place in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with imiquimod and the risk associated with a possible worsening of their autoimmune disease.</seg>
<seg id="2189">It should take place in these patients between the benefits of a treatment with imiquimod and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or graft versus host- reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2190">In other studies where no daily Vorhauthygiene was performed, two cases of severe phimosis and a case with one to circumcision leading Striktur were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2191">In an application of imiquimod cream in higher than the recommended doses, there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation (see section 4.2.) In rare cases, severe local skin irritations have been observed, which made a treatment necessary and / or resulted in a temporary physical impairment.</seg>
<seg id="2192">In cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the urethra, some women had difficulty passing urine which necessitated emergency catheterisation and treatment of the affected area.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The use of imiquimod cream immediately following treatment with other cutaneous injected means for the treatment of external fooles in the genital and perianal region have not yet been clinical experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2194">While limited data suggest an increased rate of return reductions in HIV positive patients, imiquimod-cream has shown less effectiveness in this group of patients with regard to the removal of the coward warts.</seg>
<seg id="2195">The treatment of basal cell carcinoma with imiquimod within 1 cm around the eyelids, the nose, the lips or the hairline was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Local skin reactions are frequent, but the intensity of these reactions decreases generally during therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2197">If it is necessary due to the patient's complaints or due to the severity of local skin reactions, a treatment break can be made several days.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin around 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Since there is currently no data on long-term healing rates available for more than 36 months after the treatment, other appropriate therapy forms should be considered in superficial basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">There are no clinical experiences in patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs, so the application is not recommended in pre-treated tumours.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tumors (&gt; 7.25 cm2) there is a lower chance of response to imiquimod therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not studied for the treatment of actinic keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip-dawn.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Very limited data are available on the application of imiquimod for treatment of actinial keratoses in anatomical areas outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinial keratosis on the underarms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application, therefore such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions occur frequently, but these reactions usually take effect in the course of therapy or go back after the treatment with imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong, treatment may be suspended for several days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">From the data of an open clinical study, patients with more than 8 active lesions showed a lower total cure rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immune-stimulating properties, imiquimod cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although the level of serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) quantifiable after several times has been achieved, no recommendation can be given to the application during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly reported and probable or possibly related adverse events in the studies of imiquimod-cream in the trials with three-week treatment were local reactions at the location of the treatment of the patients (33.7% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">The most commonly reported and probable or possibly with the application of imiquimod cream related side effects include complaints at the application location with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The 185 patients treated with imiquimod cream from a placebo-controlled Phase III clinical study reported side effects are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, probable or possibly related side effect of imiquimod cream application was a response to the application location (22% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">Adverse events reported by 252 in placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials with imiquimod cream are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">This clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with imiquimod cream, it frequently came to local skin reactions including Erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excoriation / flattening (23%) and edema (14%) (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">This review of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these studies, with five-week treatment with imiquimod cream, severe erosions (31%), severe erosions (13%), and severe choral formation and calming (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials investigating the application of imiquimod for the treatment of actin keratosis, alopecia was determined with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment site or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The inadvertent orale intake of 200 mg of Imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headaches, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinical serious side-effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg was in hypotony normalized after oral or intravenous ablation.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic investigation, systemic concentrations of alpha interferons and other cytokines have been detected following the topical application of imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies, it was shown that efficacy concerning a complete healing of the cowards in an imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is significantly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">60% of the patients treated with imiquimodine completely healed the patients; this was 20% of the patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 male patients treated with imiquimod, compared to 5% of 161 male patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">Imiquimod's efficacy in five-day use per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficial basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all patients were clinically healed and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of imiquimod for three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non hypertrophic ac- lesions within a cohesive 25 cm2 treatment area on the uncomfortable scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The single-year data from two combined monitoring studies indicate a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications external Feignizen, actinian keratosis and superficial basal cell carcinoma usually do not appear in paediatric patients and therefore have not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, Placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of imiquimod could not be demonstrated in these studies during the dosages studied there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic intake of the 5% imiquimod cream due to the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed during the three-week application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml when applied in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after the subcutaneous application in an earlier study; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Systemic exposure data showed that the resorption of imiquimod after topical application on MC-diseased skin of patients aged 6-12 years was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or superficial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study of dermal toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study carried out for four months for dermal application showed no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study of carcinogenicity in mice on three days a week did not induce tumors at the application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod only has low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, there is a very low risk to the human being due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Tumors appeared in the group of mice treated with the active-free cream, earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2256">Breastfeed your baby during treatment with Aldara Cream because it is not known whether imiquimod occurs in breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">Frequency and duration of treatment are different for Feignizen, basal cell carcinoma and actin keratosis (see specific instructions for each application).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara Cream onto the clean, dry skin with the coward warts and gently rub the cream on the skin until the cream is completely absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with cowards under the foreskin will have to withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area underneath (see section 2 "What do you need to consider before applying Aldara Cream?").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Apply a sufficient amount of Aldara Cream for 6 weeks each week to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area.</seg>

<seg id="2265">A reduced number of blood cells can make you more susceptible to infections; it can cause you to create a blue stain faster or they can cause fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will affect you considerably or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this utility information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas you have applied Aldara Cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Usually these are lighter skin reactions which end up again within approximately 2 weeks after the treatment has been stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally some patients notice changes in the application location (wound secretions, inflammation, swelling, peeling, skin irritation, blisters, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non neurological symptoms of the MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, complicate movements, reduced lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or hospital with revitalizing devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines before administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study focused mainly on the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness was also measured (by examining its effect in reducing GAG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">For children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by around 60%, and half of the children treated showed a normal big liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), arthralgia (joint pain), pain sensation, fever and reactions to the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under the age of five are elevated blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be known and update this summary whenever necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive Aldurazyme with regard to the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission issued a licence to the Genzyme Europe B.V. to transport Aldurazyme across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammalian cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, Chinese hamster ovarian).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be performed by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other editary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosing scheme can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined, and no dosing scheme can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions defined as any related side effect occurring during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only take place in a reasonable clinical environment where revitalization facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that almost all patients form IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer break, due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment, it is necessary to proceed cautiously.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before commencing the infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or antipyretics) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a light or moderate infusion-induced reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be resumed by reducing the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate at which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procaine because there is a potential risk of interferenz with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there are no data in newborns exposed to laronidase via breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were reported predominantly as infusion-related responses observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration of treatment of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions related to Aldurazyme, observed during the phase 3 study and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or over at a duration of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table: very common (≥ 1 / 100); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related complications of the upper respiratory tract and lung prehistory, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, respiratory downtimes and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Undesirable Drug Effects associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a Phase- 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years, with predominantly severe course of treatment and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients were treated with a seroconversion within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment, whereas in the patients at the age of 5 with a severe form of severity there was usually a seroconversion (on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to a premature withdrawal from the study) no antibodies were detectable in 13 / 45 patients (RIP) Assay, including 3 patients who had never been treated with seroperversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the urine of the GAG in urine whereas in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG in urine was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low-neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro, which did not seem to impair the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions, even if adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Following intravenous infusion, laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, the most likely via manose-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged between 6 and 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study that showed the entire spectrum of disease, the majority of patients were from the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FeV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FeV and the absolute walking distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme every week for a further 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed improvement of lung function and the ability to pay compared to the placebo group, presented in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as highlighted in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the expected percentage of FeV is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes further increased proportionally to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) up to the end of the study had normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of the GAG level was found in the urine (µg / mg Kreatinin), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into account clinically significant changes across five efficacy variable (expected percentage normal feedback, range in the 6-minute walk, range of shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted, in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients who were 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study (16 patients with severe sequential form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased Gag- mirror in urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were determined according to the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with severe concourse form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed normal mental development speed whereas only limited or no progress in cognitive development could be observed in the older patients.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase-4 study, studies on pharmacodynamics effects of various Aldurazyme dosing systems were performed on the GAG-Spiegel in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk-test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks may represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosage schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood image changes or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, stopped or the dose decreased.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetrexed slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from spreading.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetrexed into its active form is more easily done in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study involving 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, compared with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared to gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study involving 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin survived an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months in the single administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the mean survival time of Alimta was 8,3 months compared to 7,9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in whom the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells reported longer survival times compared to the comparison drug in the administration of Alimta.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a licence to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. to sell Alimta to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each piercing bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection (9 mg / ml), resulting in a 25 mg / ml solution.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the piercing bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with cisplatin for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell carcinoma (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with Lo- Kal advanced or metastatic non-small cell carcinoma (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) is administered intravenously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² of KOF as an infusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the completion of the Pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small bronchial cancer following previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered intravenously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given on the day before and on the day of the Pemetrexed-Gift as well as on the day after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetremixed, a minimum of 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last pemetric dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) a week before the first Pemetrexed dose and after each third movement cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who receive Pemetrexed, a complete blood image should be created prior to each application, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and platelet cysts.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">A dose verification must take place at the beginning of a new treatment cycle, taking into account the Nadir blood pattern or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3 that apply to ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients not develop haematological toxicity ≥ degree 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA needs to be stopped if a haematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity of 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose reductio stages or continued with the appearance of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that at the age of 65 years or more patients at the age of 65 have an increased risk of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a creatinin-clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dose adaptations recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin-Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore, the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5-times the upper Bilirubin limit and / or transaminase values of &gt; 3.0-times the upper limit value (if metastases in liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value (for the presence of liver metastases) were not studied specifically in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients need to be monitored with regard to bone market resuppression and Pemetrexed may not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophal count restores a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the platelet of cytes again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophes, platelets and maximum non-hematological toxicity observed in the preceding cycles of treatment (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 haematological and non-matological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neutropenia was examined if pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetrexed need to be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure for the reduction of treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with moderate to moderate renal failure (creatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous intake of nonsteroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cylic acid (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients for whom treatment is provided with Pemetrexed need to avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients displaying these events had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, preexisting high blood pressure, or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, a drainage of the effusion before the Pemetremixed treatment should be considered in patients with clinically significant fluid retention in the transcellular space.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 Major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical studies with Pemetrexed when this active substance was usually given in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated live vaccine (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible impairment of reproductive ability is due to Pemetrexed, men should be advised in front of the treatment order to obtain advice regarding sperm conservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min), high doses of non-steroidal antiphlogistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid (≥ 1.3 g daily) can result in reduced Pemetremixed excretion with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">It is therefore advisable to use high doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses in patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy, be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with a long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application with Pemetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Norised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with ande- or antimetabolites, serious birth defects are expected in an application during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed may not be used during pregnancy unless required and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive ability is due to Pemetrexed, men should be advised to consult with regard to the blockage retention before the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetrexed moves into breast milk and unwanted effects on the breastfed infant cannot be ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is a antineoplastic anti-folate that exerts its effect by interrupting important metabolic processes that are necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetrexed works as an antifolate with multiple targets by blocking the thymidylatsynthase (TS), Dihydrofolatreduktase (DHCP) and glycamidribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), the folate-dependent key enzymes in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purulucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicenter, randomized, single-blind phase 3 study by ALIMTA plus Cisplatin against Cisplatin in chemonaiven patients with malignant pleural kinelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically significant advantage of survival compared to those who were only bundled with cisplatin.</seg>

<seg id="2507">In the two studies of patients with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who had recovered Alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year, compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with alli in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no weight loss relevant to patients could be observed.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (Body-Mass-Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypokaloric, fat-induced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli may not be used by children and adolescents under 18, since there are insufficient data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Since orlistat is only minimal resorption, no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the other ingredients • Ciclosporin (see Section 4.5) • Chronic Malabsorption Syndrome • Pregancy (see section 4.6) • Dealing time (see section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see Section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a low-fat single meal or a fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a treatment with alli, as the dosage of antidiabetic medicine may need to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who use alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these medicines needs to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy-prevention measures in order to prevent the potential failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on the interactions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a reduction of Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick values (internationally normal ratio, INR) could be affected (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">Most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical trials remained the levels of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as beta carotene in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take supplements of the multivitamin supplement before bedtime in order to ensure adequate vitamin absorption (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the addition of a single dose Amiodarone, a minor decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological effect of the drug as the absorption of recorded fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 1.000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000), not known (frequency on the basis of available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of known side effects noted after the introduction of orlistat is unknown, as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† Es are plausible that the treatment with alli can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obese subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings occurring.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the launch of orlistat overdose, no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on examinations on humans and animals, a rapid regression of any systemic effects can be assumed, which can be attributed to the existing properties of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect prevails in the lumens of the stomach and the upper small intestine by means of covalent bonding to the active Serin remnant of the gastric and pankreatic lipases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks the absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 attest to the effectiveness of 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day in combination with a hypokaloric, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight relative to the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was evaluated as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a percentage of those who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first six months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average dietary change in the Gesamtcholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% with orlistat - 2.4% (baseline value 5,20 mmol / l) and placebo + 2.8% (baseline value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average LDL Cholesterins change was 60 mg -3.5% with orlistat (baseline 3,30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (baseline value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At waist circumference, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103.7 cm) and placebo -3.6 cm (baseline value 103,5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma could be detected sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients who administered the minimal systemic resorbiated dose, two main metabolites, i.e. M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lactonring) and M3 (M1, after the N-Formyl leucine group), were identified, which represented approximately 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity in repeated applications, genotoxicity, canogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi is increased by the addition of a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended, as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active substance inhibits the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>

<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in highly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in the case of excessively heretogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by highly emetogenic chemotherapy can be amplified by adding a corticosteroids given before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with anamnesty obstipation or signs of subacute ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is required with simultaneous administration of palonosetron with medicines that prolong the QT interval or in patients where the QT interval is extended or which tend to such extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi should not be used either for prevention or to treat nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five studied chemotherapy drugs (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a one-time intravenous palonosetron and a steady state- concentration oral methoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">A pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population showed that the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and Rifampicin) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (amiodarone, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, haloperidol, paroxetine, sertraline and terbinafine) had no significant effect on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences for the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not present, therefore, Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events were reported at a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which were at least possibly related to Aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions at the place of delivery (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar occurrences of adverse events as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-active relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out, however, due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably not effective therapy in an alopia overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients receiving a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 of dolasetron (half-life time 7.3 hours) were given that was given intravenously on day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, 667 patients receiving a highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin and 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg ondansetron given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies of indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval were comparable to the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of preliminary clinical studies, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in the ventricular degeneration and reolarisation and to extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EKG effects of palonosetron administered in I.V. in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption According to IV administration following an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average terminale half-time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area below the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally in the entire dose range of 0.3 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients dosisproportionally.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Following intravenous Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations, the overall composition (AUC0- ∞) reached at once daily intravenous dosage of 0.25 mg Palonosetron was comparable to that after a one-off intravenous administration of 0.75 mg. however, the Cmax was higher after the addition of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, are involved in the enzyme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 on the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous 10 microgram / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unmodified active substance made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Following a one-time intravenous captive bolt injection in healthy patients the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminale elimination time and the average systemic exposure to palonosetron are increased, however, a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after exposure to expositions, which are considered adequate above the maximal humantherapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 Pre-clinical trials showed that palonosetron can block only very high concentrations of ion channels involved in ventricular de- and reolarisation and extend the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose expressed in approximately 30 times the therapeutic exposure of humans), which were given daily for two years, resulted in increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marrow) and skin tumours in rats, but not mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is intended for a unique application in humans, the relevance of these results is low as for the human being.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) passed a negative report, in which the approval of the medicine for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicinal product called Roferon-A with the same medicinal ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called" "" "reference medicinal products" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (liver disease caused by virus infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic investigation the liver tissue has damages, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Amino sferase (ALT) are elevated in the blood standard.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which stimulates it to the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon gave data that substantiate the comparison of Alpheon using Roferon-A (active substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and six months after the treatment had stopped treatment (i.e. no indication of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns were voiced to the fact that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease flared up again in more patients than with the reference drug; Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug triggers an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), is not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of impetigo (a skin infection that is associated with crustacal formation) and small ininfected infirations (cracking or cutting wounds), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not be affected by these kinds of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the skin surface to be treated should not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85,6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients in placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together with skin wound, approximately 90% of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (ice-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that were demonstrably or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side-effect with Altargo (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation at the place of the job.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo were predominant in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirations, abrasions or sewn wound wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission issued a licence to the Glaxo Group Ltd., a licence for the marketing of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of sensitizing or severe local irritation by using retapamulin ointment the treatment should be stopped, the ointment must be carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection will commence.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as a pathogen (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">The efficacy of Retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in clinical trials was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected area after a 2 to 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations, which have been achieved in humans for topical application on skewed skin or infected superficial wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After a simultaneous oral administration of 2-times daily 200 mg ketoconazol, the mean retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax under topical application of 1% reapamulin ointment on a skewed skin of healthy adult men increased by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adjustments are not required if topical retapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral ingestion and are inadequate in relation to a statement affecting the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin ointment should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retapamulin is preferable to the application of systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether the breastfeeding should be continued or terminated or the therapy with Altargo should be continued or terminated, consider the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that Altargo used, the most commonly reported side effect was irritation at the date of delivery which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of action of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a specific binding site of the bacterial ribosome that distinguishes itself from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data suggest that the binding point ribosomal protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P binding site and the Peptidyltransferase Center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibit the peptide transfer, block partial P-binding and prevent normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If due to the local prevalence of resistance the use of retapamulin in at least some infection forms seem to be questionable, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the event of a non-response to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption in a healthy adult study, 1% reapamulin ointment was applied daily under occlusion to intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin ointment twice a day for 5 days for the topical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Samples were taken on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic absorption on humans after topical use of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 skewed skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the retinotulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of Retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, under low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro examination on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in mouse lymphoma test respectively in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the rats microkernel test for in vivo investigation of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, thereby achieving an exposure of up to 5 times higher than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 skewed skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats at oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to the ≥ 3-fold estimated human exposure (see above)), development toxicity (reduced body weight of fetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmaceutical covigilance system, as presented in the 1.8.1 module of the Authorisation Application (version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the product is marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner of the authorisation for the placing on the market commits himself to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical covigilance activities in the Pharmaccovigilance plan, as described in Version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all additional updates of the RMP, agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Associations for human use," the updated RMP should simultaneously be submitted with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms appear in the treated area, you should quit the application of Altargo and speak to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if you are not specifically prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment gets out of sight on one of these surfaces, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if ailments occur.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "Ambirix will be applied as part of a two-canned vaccination plan, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved once the second dose is administered." ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immunisation process and it is ensured that the vaccination plan consisting of two doses can lead to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desired for hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or any other hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"" "vaccines work by" "" "teach" "" "the immune system (natural defences of the body), as it can defend itself against a disease." ""</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "alien" "" "and creates antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine TwinCArix adults approved since 1996 and the vaccine TwinCArix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however, both adults and Macrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twindas contain adults identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Macrix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for efficacy was the percentage of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix performed between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective anti-antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambirix's degree of protection was similar to a six-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccines) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection site, redness, matiness (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission issued a permit to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a permit for the placing of Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the pridimminization with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, the first dose is given at the date of the election and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster is requested both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, the appropriate monovalent vaccines or a combination vaccine can be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) are the same as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully ensured whether immunocompetent persons who have addressed hepatitis A vaccination require a booster disease as protection, as they may also be protected by immunological memory even in case of no more detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, an anaphylactic reaction after the addition of the vaccine should always be immediately available for medical treatment and monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended using the combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of formal ininininininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hematalysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody value after pridimming, so that in these cases the administration of further vaccines may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">These injections should be avoided as intradermal injection or intramuscular administration into the gluteal muscle could lead to a suboptimal infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, in cases of thrombocytopenia or blood clots, however, Ambirix can be injected by subcutaneous injections as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular administration of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined diphtheri-, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or combined with a combined mass of mumps, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects it must be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study, which was carried out with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matchiness, gastroenteritis, headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier ThiomerSalt and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 Vaccins Ambirix were administered to a total of 1027 Vaccines at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years, Ambirix compatibility was compared with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and matchiness on a calculation basis per Vaccine dose of Ambirix, but not on a basis for calculation per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix in 50.7% of the subjects compared to 39.1% in the subjects after the dose of a 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had received Ambirix had reported pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects that had been vaccinated with the 3-can combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the abundance of matches was comparable to per test band (i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who were given an ambirix compared to 36.2% in the subjects receiving the 3-doses combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and pain was low and comparable to those observed after the combination of the combination vaccine with the 3-doses vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- and 11-year-old vaccinations, the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgruppe was comparable to that which was observed in combination with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formal inininininininininininininininininininininininininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after inoculation with Ambirix a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccinations that reported severe side effects during the 2-doses vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalinininininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials, which were conducted for vaccinations at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years, the anti-HAV seroconversion rates were 99,1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>

<seg id="2767">In people who were aged between 12 and 15 years old, persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunoreaction against both antigens observed in this study was comparable to that after inoculation of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units with formalininininactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-olds, it could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life coincided with the booster release of a combined diphtheri-, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens.</seg>

<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not completely protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is already infected with Hepatitis A- or Hepatitis B Virus prior to administration of both Vaccination doses (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>

<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child of an inoculation with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend 3 injections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective components per vaccination dose (360 ELISA units of a formal ininininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccination protection before the end of the vaccination series.</seg>

<seg id="2805">Based on the data that have become known since the first approval for the placing of the market, the CHMP asserted that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remained positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was placed in circulation only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine are limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in prehistory for patients aged over 1 month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage as a result of high ammonia concentrations).</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonaps - split into several individual doses at meals - is swallowed, mixed into the food or administered via a Gastrostomieschl (through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, because Ammonaps could not be compared with a different treatment or placebo (a pseudo-medication, i.e. without an active agent).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonaps can also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or taste sensation, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevents high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonaps was admitted under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this medicine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The application is indicated in all patients, in which a complete lack of enzyme already manifests itself in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first month of life), an indication is applied when a hyperammonia encephalopathy exists in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swallowing, AMMONAPS is also available in granule form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein absorption of the patient for the growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early deficiency of carbambophosphate synthetase or orniinintranscarbamylase, substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinosuccinate deficiency need to receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swallowing, as there is a risk of esophagusulcera formation if the tablets do not reach the stomach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, respectively 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or serious renal insufficiency, as well as in conjunction with sodium retention and demoralization.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate over the liver and kidneys occurs, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">Subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats at high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg) resulted in slowing of neuronal proliferation and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve endings in the brain and thereby impaired brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted in the breast milk in humans, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at least 56% of patients had at least one adverse event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not connected with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactacidosis, severe hypokalemia, armored topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose occurred during a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms come with the accumulation of phenylacetate which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is an active compound that is conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 Patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram taken sodium phenylbutyrate can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and treatment is immediately started in order to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infaust, and the disease itself led to death even in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemodialysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of neutered in postpartal (however, within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">Patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyperammonia encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in those patients it occurred with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the Orniintranscarbamylase deficiency), which recovered from a hyperammonia encephalopathy and were subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further worsening of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is enzymatic conjugated with glutamine in the liver and kidneys, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined according to a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate for sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following IV administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form, 15 minutes after intake measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2846">According to various doses of phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day), no phenylacetate in the plasma was detectable in the majority of patients with urinary cylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day).</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis treated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the average phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted over the kidneys within 24 hours to approximately 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrate had no plaintive effects in rats treated with toxic and non-toxic cans (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is either taken orally (babies and children who cannot take tablets or patients with difficulty swallowing) or via a Gastrostomieschl or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (in particular branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early deficiency of carbambophosphate synthetase or orniinintranscarbamylase, substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat-flutes were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrate), lesions in the pyramid cells of the cerebral cortex occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactacidosis, severe hypokalemia, armored topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess ammonia.</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the secretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that for each gram taken sodium phenylbutyrate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen is produced.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in treatment, and in some patients a further worsening of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granular form, 15 minutes after intake measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in cases of unstable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) (abnormal measurement of electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angioxin was compared with only a dose or in connection with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) compared with the conventional combination treatment with heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During PCI, patients were often used a stent (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent a closure), and they also received other medicines to prevent blood clots like abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without a gift of GPI - was as effective as conventional treatment in the prevention of new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, Angiox was as effective in all indicators as heparin, except for severe bleeding, with which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Bivalirudin, other hirudine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a licence to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd, for the placing of angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="2891">The recommended starting dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous intake of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If the patient is subsequently PCI, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">A bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered immediately before the procedure, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of Angiox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial IV infusion of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and a subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of an exclusive Bolus-Gift from Angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is reduced to under 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicinal product should be carefully mixed before the application and the bolt dosage should be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered properly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which one PCI is subjected to (whether treated with Bivalirudin vs. ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second dose of the bolt must be checked again.</seg>

<seg id="2907">Even if the most bleeding of arterial spots occurs in the case of PCI patients under Bivalirudin, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can occur during the treatment, in principle, bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients receiving warfarin and treated with a bivalirudin, monitoring the INR value (International Norised Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after settling of the treatment with bivalirudin returns the existing level before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombocytenaggregationshemmer) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalirudin with thrombocyte aggregations or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters are checked regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Animal experimental investigations are inadequate in relation to the effects of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, de-binding or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomised to bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the bivalirudin group and in the comparative groups treated with heparin were more common in women and patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to the ACUITY and Timi standards for severe bleeding like in Table 2 footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both bleedings and bleedings were significantly less frequent under Bivalirudin than in the groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor plus bivalidrudine plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the puncture area, which necessitates radiological or surgical intervention, reduction of hemoglobin mirror ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other, less commonly observed bleeding locations, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" puncture points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on adverse events is based on data from a clinical study conducted with bivalirudin in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the bivalirudin group and in the comparative groups treated with heparin, it was more common in women and patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both bleedings and bleedings were significantly less frequent under Bivalirudin than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, have been reported in practice following a comprehensive application and are grouped according to system organism classes in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdose, the treatment with a bivalirudin is immediately broken off and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombinhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic centre and to the ion binding region of Thrombin, regardless of whether Thrombin is present in the liquid phase or in clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin to Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin, on its part, slowly splits the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, thus regenerating the function of the active centre of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, Bivalirudin with serum of patients who had come to heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS) did not induce a platelet aggregation reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, bivalirudin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is covered by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI is performed in the following, an additional pin of 0,5mg / kg of bivalirudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1,75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, fractionated heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before beginning of angiography (at the time of randomisation) or PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients who required angiography within 72 hours were equally distributed across the 3 arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Approximately 77% of patients had recurrent ischemia; 70% had dynamic EKC changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent angiography within 72 hours.</seg>

<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple endpoints of a randomised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2) study, are shown in Table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angioxin in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of bivalirudin were evaluated in patients undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalirudin as peptide has a catabolism in its amino acid components with subsequent reutilization of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolism resulting from the split of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence by Thrombin is not effective because of the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In patients with normal renal function, elimination is performed after a first order process with a half-life time of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity in repeated applications, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Toxicity in animals during repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks in exposure to 10-times of the steady state plasma concentration) was limited to excessive pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Side effects following long-term physiological stress as a response to non-homeostatic coagulation were not observed after short-term exposure comparable to those in clinical application, even at very much higher dosage.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children aged six and older with diabetes requiring treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is administered subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose (sugar) in the blood or insulin cannot be effectively processed.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin is very slightly different from the human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short-acting insulin insulator.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in the application in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between 4 and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where the body insulin cannot be processed effectively, Apidra was studied in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was to change the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of type 1 diabetes in adults, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed in comparison to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin lispro.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the lowering of the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% with human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a licence to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the placing of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be applied as subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal wall, thigh or delta muscle, or subcutaneous by continuous infusion into the area of the abdominal cavity.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose level and the reduced insulin metabolism, insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">The type of insulin (normal, NPH, zinc retarding, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production, can lead to changes in insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or interruption of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">A patient's switch to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change in the dosage necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency towards hypoglycemia include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramid, fibrate, fluoxetine, pentoxifyllin, propoxyphene, salizylate and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympololytics such as beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidine and reserpine, the symptoms of the adrenal counterregulation can be weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and Humaninsulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisin occurs in the human breast milk, but generally insulin does not enter the breast milk nor is absorbed by oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Below, the undesirable drug vertebrates that are known from clinical trials are classified according to system organism classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of occurrence (very often: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1.000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 1,000); not known (frequency on the basis of available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, tiredness, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, drowsiness, excessive hun-, headaches, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy will be foamed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area, as a result, a lipodystrophy can occur at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by means of an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given by an appropriately trained person, or by intravenous glucose from glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After gluing, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially by skeletal musculature and fat) and by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies of healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that the effect occurs faster in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin lulisin and the duration of the active insulin is shorter than with a cough-manem insulin analog insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male subjects at the age of 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melli- tus insulin lulisin showed a disproportionate glucosestic effect in the therapeutic-relevant dosage range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosesening effect, exactly like Humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a double as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosal effect approximately 2 hours earlier than a human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">It was evident from the data that a comparable postprandial glycaemic control is achieved in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, as with the human insulin analog insulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin lulisin was cooled 2 minutes before the meal, better postpranal control was achieved than with the human insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved, as with the human normal insulin, which is given 2 mi- nuten before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin 2 minutes (GLULISIN - previously) before the start of the meal compared to normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the start of the meal (figure 1A) and compared to a human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin in gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal compared to the human Nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (figure 1C).</seg>
